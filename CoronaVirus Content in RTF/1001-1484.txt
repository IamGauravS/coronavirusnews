The three main reasons behind the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts on Tuesday help explain why the central bank is likely to lower rates again.
The Fed hoped to boost public confidence, prevent financial conditions from worsening and cushion the U.S. economy against a global growth downturn.
While the rate cut may help on each of those fronts, the outlook could grow darker in the weeks ahead as the number of U.S. coronavirus cases rises.
The rate cut Tuesday came between the Fed's regularly scheduled policy meetings, illustrating urgency to get ahead of an unfolding shock, even if the underlying nature of the threat isn't economic.
Since 1998, the Fed has cut interest rates six other times between regularly scheduled meetings. Following each of those moves, the Fed has lowered rates again at its next policy meeting.
"For us, what really matters of course is not the epidemiology, but the risk to the economy," said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday. "So we saw a risk to the outlook for the economy and chose to act."
Any good economic data released in coming weeks can be easily dismissed because they will show how the economy fared prior to the spread of the virus. And more bad news seems likely.
Confidence could falter as health authorities test more widely for the infection, revealing how far it has spread and possibly prompting school closures and remote work arrangements.
"The effects are at a very early stage," said Mr. Powell, referring to increasingly negative sentiment from travel and hospitality businesses. "We expect that will continue. It will probably grow."
The same dynamic could weigh on financial markets. Measures to contain and mitigate the damage could force companies to lower their earnings forecasts and weigh on stock and corporate-bond markets. The Fed acted Tuesday rather than wait until its March 17-18 meeting to prevent a deeper pullback in credit availability that can occur when lenders reassess borrowers' creditworthiness.
Mr. Powell said the Fed was prepared for a possible increase in corporate defaults or business failures. "We don't see any of that happening yet. Of course, we are thinking about what we can do, should those things happen," he said.
Finally, the U.S. economy faces disrupted supply chains and weaker global economic activity. This downturn could deepen if policy makers abroad aren't able or willing to spur growth. Interest rates are already low and many central banks don't have the wherewithal to reduce them much further.
Countries already experiencing low rates of growth—such as Italy, Japan and Germany—are very likely to sink into recession in the coming months. "We need to be mindful that the impact from the outbreak could be big," Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said Wednesday.
Other central banks with interest rates above zero cut them this week. The Bank of Canada reduced its policy rate by half a percentage point, and the Reserve Bank of Australia reduced its policy rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to a record low of 0.5%.
The Fed's cut took its benchmark rate to a range between 1% and 1.25%, leaving it more room than most other developed-economy central banks to cut further. U.S. rate cuts also make it easier for central banks in emerging markets to lower their borrowing costs without triggering capital flight.
U.S. bond markets may be showing greater signs of hazard ahead. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to new lows on Tuesday and Wednesday. While declines in bond yields in recent weeks have reflected lower inflation expectations and investors seeking havens, most of the most recent drop reflects lower growth expectations, said Roberto Perli, an analyst at research firm Cornerstone Macro.

What economic impact from the coronavirus concerns you the most? Join the conversation below.
Over more than 6,000 trading days since 1997, growth expectations reflected in the benchmark 10-year Treasury have fallen by a larger magnitude than they did on Tuesday only 25 times, and most of those were during or before recessions hit, he said.
Lower borrowing costs aren't likely to be effective without broader confidence-building efforts by federal and local authorities to demonstrate they have put in place measures to diagnose and slow the spread of the new coronavirus.
Stock markets tumbled after Tuesday's Fed decision but rallied on Wednesday, illustrating how investors are still reconciling the challenges facing corporate profits and economic activity in the months ahead.
Tuesday's rate cut shouldn't be judged by immediate market reactions, said Jim Vogel, a rate strategist at FHN Financial in Memphis, Tenn.
"It was not a 'rescue' mission that demands an immediate letter grade from bond or stock traders who are still dealing with intensely volatile prices," he said. "It was a first step, designed to keep the central bank in line with [the disease's] spread over the last two weeks."

The Time Has Come Again for 'Panic in the Streets'; Elia Kazan's 1950 film about a spreading contagion is especially resonant today.

Carl Goldman, a 67-year-old California radio-station owner, was infected with coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Today he is in quarantine in a facility in Omaha run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He recently wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post called "I Have the Coronavirus. So Far, It Isn't That Bad" in which he remarked that his quarantine location, which was last used for the 2014 Ebola outbreak, "looked like something out of 'The Andromeda Strain,'" Robert Wise's high-tech screen version of Michael Crichton's 1969 novel about a mysterious illness that turns out to have been caused by an extraterrestrial virus.
One of the things about Mr. Goldman's piece that struck me most forcibly was that he resorted so naturally to a movie-based metaphor to describe his experience. If you're a baby boomer, you're likely to do that fairly often, since the boomers all grew up watching the same "water-cooler movies." Even the CDC does it: Thomas R. Frieden, director of the CDC from 2009 to 2017, wrote in the Atlantic that "Contagion," Steven Soderbergh's 2011 film about a pandemic, was "a fair and accurate portrayal of how the public health community might respond to a disease outbreak like the fictional one in the film."
That was quite an endorsement, especially given the fact that countless such movies, most of them eminently forgettable and deservedly forgotten, have been ground out by Hollywood. ("The Killer That Stalked New York," anyone?) A few, however, have been rather more noteworthy, among them not only "The Andromeda Strain" and "Contagion," but Alfonso Cuarón's "Children of Men" (2006) and Wolfgang Petersen's "Outbreak" (1995), which told the fictionalized tale of how an Ebola-like virus spread across Africa and into the U.S. Moreover, one such film, Elia Kazan's "Panic in the Streets" (1950), is not merely a nail-nibbling thriller but Kazan's first indisputably major film, a now-classic piece of noir-style urban cinematic storytelling.
"Panic" was shot entirely on location in New Orleans. Rich in local color and full of vivid performances by a top-tier cast led by Richard Widmark, it portrays with jolting immediacy the story of how a fictional U.S. Public Health Service official (played by Widmark) must race against the clock to track down a carrier of pneumonic plague before the local papers get wind of the potential for a citywide epidemic, thereby causing terrified local citizens to run for their lives and spread the disease to other cities.
Er…sound familiar?
Part of what makes "Panic in the Streets" is the high-contrast school-of-noir cinematography of Joseph MacDonald, which looks so impeccably right precisely because the unwitting carriers of the plague bacillus are small-time gangsters who refuse to believe that the plague will kill them if they don't turn themselves in first. Accordingly, much of "Panic" unfolds in a string of seedy tenements, juke joints and diners, and many of the "actors" were real-life New Orleanians whose unmistakable accents sound just like the film looks. "We used the city's people as our extras and their homes, shops, and streets for scenery," Kazan recalled in his 1988 autobiography. Long before the phrase "cinéma-vérité" entered the language, "Panic in the Streets" had the you-are-there-and-this-is-real feel of a documentary.
It's fascinating, too, to see Widmark play a good guy. Just three years earlier, he'd made his film debut in "Kiss of Death," in which he played Tommy Udo, a murderous psychopath who shoves a wheelchair-bound woman down a flight of stairs and giggles as she bounces. From that horrific moment onward, casting directors thought of him as the baddest of bad guys, a piece of typecasting that bore no resemblance to the real-life Widmark, a part-time gentleman farmer who hated violence and was married to the same woman from 1942 until her death in 1997. Not surprisingly, he longed to break free from the snickering-monster stereotype that made him a star, and Kazan made it possible for him to do so in "Panic in the Streets," in which he plays a good-hearted family man whose only "vice" is his single-minded devotion to his indispensable job.
Epidemiology, needless to say, has made colossal strides in the nearly seven decades since the release of "Panic in the Streets." But the fundamental problem facing those government officials whose duty it is to keep coronavirus under control remains unchanged: How do you stop an infectious disease from spreading all over the world now that it's possible for anyone to jump on a plane and travel to another continent within hours? "We're all in a community—the same one!" Widmark's character warns the politicians who long to cover up what is happening to their town. "I could leave here today and be in Africa tomorrow—and whatever disease I had would go with me." Rarely have those simple but telling words been as relevant as they are today.

Fed's Bullard Tells Bloomberg TV March Rate Cut Isn't a Done Deal; The St. Louis Fed president said investors shouldn't be so certain the central bank will lower rates again at its policy meeting later this month

FULL TEXT
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said in a television interview Wednesday investors shouldn't be so certain the central bank will lower rates again at its policy meeting later this month.
Mr. Bullard, speaking on Bloomberg's television channel, took stock of what the Fed's emergency rate cut of half a percentage point on Tuesday meant for the monetary-policy outlook.
When it came to lowering rates to help protect the U.S. economy from risks related to the new coronavirus, Mr. Bullard said "we were probably going to have to move at the March meeting anyway, so why not move that up and do it sooner."
He added that with the Tuesday rate cut, "we got the policy rate to the right place for now" and "we took out some insurance against the possibility [the coronavirus and its impact] will cause a growth slowdown in the U.S."
On Tuesday, the Fed lowered the federal-funds target rate to between 1.00% and 1.25%. In its statement it explained "the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity." Financial markets had been widely expecting a rate cut and they anticipate more easing from the central bank.
But Mr. Bullard, who isn't currently a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, offered a note of caution on that line of thinking.
"I wouldn't want to put a tremendous amount of focus on this March meeting, there won't be a lot of new information there that we don't have today," Mr. Bullard said. He added that the Fed has already shown it can change rates whenever it wants in any case, so it has space to react to rapidly moving events. The FOMC next meets on March 17-18.
Mr. Bullard was one of a clutch of Fed officials who had cast some doubt on the need for rate cuts ahead of Tuesday's action. He said on Friday "further policy rate cuts are a possibility if a global pandemic actually develops with health effects approaching the scale of ordinary influenza, but this is not the baseline case at this time."
The next few days will bring a slew of Fed officials speaking. On Friday, a conference in New York will see appearances from New York Fed leader John Williams, as well as the leaders of the Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago Fed banks. They may offer their own outlooks for monetary policy in what are uncertain times.

Oil Erases Wednesday Gains With Investors Awaiting OPEC Signals; U.S. crude stockpiles rose less than expected, but domestic production reached a record 13.1 million barrels a day last week

Oil prices erased an earlier advance and closed lower Wednesday, swinging with traders looking ahead to a coming decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and weighing the latest signs of softening fuel demand.
U.S. crude futures closed down 0.8% at $46.78 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after earlier climbing about 2.5%. Prices are 26% below a peak hit Jan. 6 and recently hit their lowest point since December 2018, hurt by the economic fallout from the coronavirus, which has dented travel and fuel consumption.
On Wednesday, Brent crude, the global gauge of prices, closed down 1.4% at $51.13 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange.
The recent volatility comes with OPEC and allies including Russia gathering in Vienna this week. Many analysts expect the group to deepen existing production cuts of 1.7 million barrels a day, but there is uncertainty about how much more the cartel will lower supply.
Russia remains opposed to a plan put forth by Saudi Arabia to deepen the existing cuts by 1.2 million barrels a day, The Wall Street Journal reported. Russian President Vladimir Putin offered a mixed message over the weekend, saying he was ready to continue cooperating with OPEC but was satisfied with current oil prices of around $50 a barrel. The current levels are too low for some OPEC nations such as Saudi Arabia to sustain their economies.
Some investors expect OPEC's response and a number of interest-rate cuts around the globe to help oil halt its downward spiral. At the same time, some analysts say the coronavirus limiting travel outside of China and swelling inventories will likely limit crude's rebound.
"While such cuts will help normalize oil demand and inventories later this year, they can't prevent an already started large oil inventory accumulation," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent note.
U.S. crude-oil stockpiles rose for the sixth consecutive week during the week ended Feb. 28, Energy Information Administration data released Wednesday showed. While the 784,000-barrel increase in inventories was less than the advance projected by analysts and traders surveyed by the Journal, the data also showed domestic production rose to a record of 13.1 million barrels a day last week.
And while some measures of travel in China have picked back up after the coronavirus dented activity in the world's largest commodity consumer earlier in the year, many analysts expect it will take time for demand to stabilize moving forward.
Wednesday's oil-price swings also came with stocks rallying after former Vice President Joe Biden won a string of states in Super Tuesday's Democratic primaries, setting up a showdown with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for the party's presidential nomination. Mr. Biden's more moderate policy stances are appealing to some investors who fear the ideas put forth by Mr. Sanders would challenge businesses and weaken the world economy.
Such disconnects like the one observed Wednesday between stocks and oil have been rare recently. With the virus fueling outsize swings across asset classes, the two have tended to trade in similar patterns as traders adjust expectations for economic growth. Crude pared nearly all of its advance on Tuesday, with stocks sliding after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a percentage point. The cut raised recession fears because some analysts don't think lower rates alone will cushion the global economy from the coronavirus.

Field Museum, Art Institute enact travel bans

In response to COVID-19 and its likely spread, the Field Museum of Natural History and the Art Institute of Chicago have banned staff from traveling to areas already profoundly affected by the coronavirus. 
At the Field, "until further notice staff cannot travel to or through any country rated with a Centers for Disease Control Travel Alert Level 3 (currently, China, Iran, Italy, South Korea)," said public relations and community awareness director Jaclyn Johnston via email Monday. "And staff returning from any country with a CDC Travel Alert Level 3 are being advised to stay home and monitor their health for up to 14 days."
Since no staffers are currently abroad for work, these restrictions apply primarily to future travel, she said, adding that "any travelers returning from any country with a Travel Alert Level 2 (currently Japan) are being encouraged to monitor their health."
The Art Institute's new rules are similar. "The museum has suspended travel to medium and high risk locations (as defined by the CDC), and we are encouraging staff to reschedule non-essential international travel," said Kati Murphy, a spokeswoman for the museum.
Both institutions, like a range of other Chicago zoos and museums surveyed for this story, said they are keenly tracking the COVID-19 situation and the guidance that health authorities give. In other countries where the virus has spread rapidly -- as it is beginning to do in the U.S. -- authorities have moved to restrict public gatherings in order to limit potential contact and the disease's spread.
"We are closely monitoring what city health officials are saying and recommending," Adler Planetarium spokeswoman Jennifer Howell said. "We will course correct as necessary to protect the health of both our staff and guests. We are emphasizing CDC best practices to prevent the spread of cold and flu."
Meanwhile, within museum walls, the Field is "taking the necessary precautions to ensure our facilities are properly disinfected and cleaned to prevent the spread of illnesses," Johnson said. These aren't new protocols, but supervisors have "reiterated the importance of meeting the high standards of our typical protocols," she said.
The Art Institute and Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago both said the viral outbreak has thus far had no impact on live performances planned in museum auditoriums or on art loans.
"We are monitoring the situation closely," said the Art Institute's Murphy. "The safety of our visitors and staff is our first priority and we will continue to update our community as needed."

U. of C. patient has tested negative for virus

A patient being treated at the University of Chicago Medical Center for a suspected coronavirus case has tested negative for the virus, hospital officials said Tuesday night. That leaves a total of four reported COVID-19 cases in Illinois. 
On Monday, the third and fourth cases in Illinois were reported: A husband and wife in their 70s both tested positive for coronavirus, but the results still needed to be confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The man was being treated at Northwest Community Hospital and his wife was under quarantine at home, officials said. Two other cases in Illinois have been confirmed by the CDC.
University of Chicago Medical Center spokeswoman Lorna Wong said the hospital has been "preparing for this eventuality" since coronavirus first became a global public health threat in January.
"Senior hospital leadership and leaders from our infectious diseases and infection prevention teams, along with other expert clinicians, are working closely with local, state and federal health officials and continue to apply up to date recommended guidelines," she said in an emailed statement.
On Monday, Arlington Heights School District 25 said two staffers and two students would be staying home as a result of possible exposure to a person who is related to a hospital worker who encountered a patient with coronavirus.
At least 15 states have reported cases of coronavirus. At least nine people have died from the disease in Washington state, officials announced Tuesday. Several of the cases, and deaths, in Washington state have been among patients at a nursing facility.
The disease has hit at least 70 countries, with 90,000 cases and 3,100 deaths. The vast majority of cases and deaths have been in China. While the number of new cases recorded daily in that epicenter country has declined for weeks, the virus continues to spread fast in South Korea, Iran and Italy, prompting increased travel warnings and restrictions.
Most cases of COVID-19 seem to be mild, said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, during a call with reporters Tuesday. A report out of China suggests that serious illness occurs in about 16% of cases, though people who are older and have underlying health conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes, are about twice as likely to develop serious cases as younger, healthier people, she said.
As of Monday evening, there were more than 100 cases of coronavirus in the U.S., including those who tested positive by their local health departments and those whose positive results have been confirmed by the CDC.
Of those cases, 22 were travel-related, 11 were spread person-to-person and the causes of 27 others were still under investigation. An additional 48 cases were among repatriated Americans, such as from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
As of Monday, 102 people in Illinois had been tested for the virus. The state health department said Tuesday it was watching a total of about 250 people for symptoms, including some of those who've already been tested.
The state has a hotline people can call with questions or to report suspected cases, 800-889-3931. They can call the Office of Consumer Health Insurance at 877-527-9431 about their insurance coverage.

A run on face masks has retailers struggling

Chicago-area retailers are running low on face masks as consumers worried about contracting coronavirus stock up. One company said it could be a matter of months before some stores replenish their supply. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention isn't recommending people wear masks to protect themselves from the virus, though people who have the virus should wear them to avoid spreading it. Stores say consumers are snapping them up regardless.
Joe Lomanto, who owns three Ace Hardware stores in Chicago, sold his last box of N95 respirators last weekend despite stocking up in advance, paying extra to ship them in from out-of-state suppliers, and rationing sales to customers to discourage people from hoarding them or reselling them online for a profit.
The respirators have more filtration material than lightweight dust masks. Lomanto's suppliers told him they hoped to deliver more N95 respirators later this week, but they made no guarantees. Manufacturers also are trying to keep up with demand from healthcare professionals.
"They don't want to promise until they know more," he said.
A majority of True Value's 4,500 stores are also sold out of respiratory masks due to an "industry-wide shortage," spokeswoman Jennifer Born said.
Chicago-based True Value, which acts as a wholesaler to independently-owned stores, expects to get a shipment of respiratory masks this week and will resupply stores that already placed orders. The company doesn't expect to receive more masks for at least three months, she said.
Home Depot also rationed N95 respirators, limiting shoppers to 10 packs each, said spokeswoman Margaret Smith. Chicago stores had limited quantities in stock, according to the retailer's website.
"Our merchandising and supply chain teams are working hard to replenish these items as quickly as possible," Smith said in an email.
Joliet Professional Pharmacy has been sold out of face masks for about four weeks. "It's never happened before, which is kind of crazy," said pharmacy manager Maura Murphy. "Everyone is freaking out about the coronavirus, but what's crazier is the flu bug is still going around, and people seem to have forgotten about that."
As of Monday evening, there were 108 cases of coronavirus, known as COVID-19, in the U.S., including those who tested positive by their local health departments and those whose positive results have been confirmed by the CDC.
Five confirmed or probable cases have been reported in Illinois, including the first instance of person-to person transmission in the U.S. The fifth case was reported Tuesday by the University of Chicago Medical Center, which is awaiting lab results to confirm a diagnosis.
Price-gougers have wasted no time looking to take advantage of local consumers worried about the virus. On Craigslist, Chicago-area sellers listed 10-packs of 3M N95 respiratory masks for as much as $140. Home Depot lists the same package at $22.97, but it isn't sold online and the retailer's website advised shoppers to call before heading to stores to make sure it was in stock.
On eBay and Amazon, some sellers sought even steeper markups. EBay said it is using both digital surveillance tools and manual checks to remove products marketed with the term "coronavirus," which violate eBay's policies against making unsubstantiated health claims. EBay also is removing those with inflated prices, under a policy that prohibits listings that "attempt to profit from human tragedy or suffering."
While face masks have been selling out the quickest, retailers also are seeing a surge in demand for hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies and other household staples.
On Saturday afternoon, an employee at the cash register at the Costco store in North Riverside said he checked out one woman who bought 21 bottles of hand sanitizer. By Sunday evening, a Highland Park Target posted a sign in its window warning shoppers it was sold out of hand sanitizer.
At Purell, employees are working overtime and the company has added shifts to meet a "substantial increase in demand" for products like hand sanitizer, hand sanitizing wipes and surface spray, Samantha Williams, senior director of corporate communications for Purell parent company Gojo, said in a statement.
The spike in demand is on the higher end of what the company has seen during prior outbreaks, but is "not unprecedented," she said.
Clorox also increased production of disinfecting products, said spokeswoman Naomi Greer. "We continue to believe we can meet the needs of retailers and others," she said.
Walgreens said it's maintaining its supply of hand sanitizer and cleaning products, and that shortages on store shelves are temporary.
"We're continually and closely monitoring the situation, and continue to work with our supplier partners to best meet the needs of our customers," spokeswoman Alex Brown said in an email.
True Value is "running very low" on hand sanitizer but expects additional shipments will arrive before its warehouse runs out, Born said. Availability may vary by store.
CVS also said it's restocking stores as fast as possible, but "due to the fluid nature of this issue we don't have specific timing to provide," spokeswoman Stephanie Cunha said in an email.
Outdoor retailer REI is working to replenish its stock of dehydrated food amid an increase in sales over the past month.
"While stores and REI.com have some options available, we have been in frequent contact with our vendors about inventory replenishment within the coming weeks," spokeswoman Megan Behrbaum said in an email.
Despite the efforts to stock up, Lomanto said consumers visiting his store didn't seem to be too worried about the outbreak yet.
"We've seen more panic with snow shovels than with this so far," he said. "I think people have faith it will work out."

Imagine an NCAA Tournament with no fans in the arenas. 
What normally would be thought an impossibility isn't so far-fetched as the United States and the rest of the world attempt to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.
An advocacy group for college athletes has urged the NCAA to consider holding its winter sports championships with no fans, and the idea has not been dismissed out of hand.
"If you can think of it, it's something that we've gone through an analysis around," NCAA Chief Operating Officer Donald Remy told Bloomberg News on Tuesday. "We've contingency planned for all circumstances."
The NCAA declined further comment to The Associated Press on the possibility of no fans in the stands. Presumably, the games still would be televised.
The virus has sickened more than 92,000 people and killed 3,100 worldwide, the vast majority of them in China. Nine people have died in the U.S., all in Washington state. Most cases have been mild.
Also Tuesday, the NCAA announced it has established an advisory panel of medical, public health and epidemiology experts and NCAA schools to address the virus, also known as COVID-19. NCAA Chief Medical Officer Dr. Brian Hainline will lead the group.
"The NCAA is committed to conducting its championships and events in a safe and responsible manner," Remy said in a statement. "Today we are planning to conduct our championships as planned; however, we are evaluating the COVID-19 situation daily and will make decisions accordingly."
Hainline said the advisory group will make recommendations on competition based on evolving medical protocols established by the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health and state and local authorities.
"We are in daily contact with the CDC and are advising leadership on the Association's response to this outbreak," he said.
The NCAA generates nearly $1 billion a year, most of it coming from the men's basketball tournament through media rights fees, corporate sponsorships and ticket sales.
Total attendance for the 2019 tournament was 688,753, an average of 19,132 per game. The Final Four at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis drew 72,711 for the semifinals and 72,062 for the championship game.
Attendance for the 2019 women's basketball tournament was 274,873, an average of 6,545 per game.
Rutgers gets key win: Jacob Young came off the bench and scored 17 points and Rutgers bolstered its NCAA Tournament hopes with a 78-67 victory over No. 9 Maryland on Tuesday night in Piscataway, N.J.
Montez Mathis added 15 points and Gio Baker had 11 as the Scarlet Knights (19-11, 10-9 Big Ten) snapped a three-game losing streak. It was their school record 18th home win (18-1) this season.
Jalen Smith had 16 points and 10 rebounds for the Terrapins (23-7, 13-6), who have dropped three of their last four. Anthony Cowan added 19 points for the Terps, who shot an atrocious 6 of 32 from 3-point range, including 2 of 16 in the first half.
Tillman leads Spartans' rally: Xavier Tillman Sr. scored 23 points and had 15 rebounds to lead No. 16 Michigan State over No. 20 Penn State 79-71 in State College, Pa.
Rocket Watts added 18 points, Cassius Winston had 14 and Aaron Henry scored 12 for the Spartans (21-9, 13-6 Big Ten), who erased a 46-31 halftime deficit to win their fourth straight.
Myreon Jones led the Nittany Lions (21-9, 11-8) with 16 points while Lamar Stevens had 15 and Mike Watkins had 12.

Meet and eat: Keuchel serves up $25K dinner

Several of the top White Sox prospects stood out in Tuesday's 6-5 loss to the Athletics at Camelback Ranch. 
Luis Robert went 1-for-2 with a walk, leading off the first with a single, stealing second and scoring on Nicky Delmonico's home run. Nick Madrigal was 1-for-3 with an RBI single in the fifth. Andrew Vaughn had an RBI double in the eighth.
Edwin Encarnacion went 0-for-2 in his return from back stiffness.
Here are three takeaways from Tuesday.
1. Dallas Keuchel bonded with his new teammates over dinner.
Dallas Keuchel wanted to get to know his new organization, so he took as many people as he could to a recent dinner at a steakhouse near the spring training facility.
The new Sox starting pitcher discussed the dinner, first reported by USA Today's Bob Nightengale.
"It was a good opportunity to get to know some of the guys away from the field," Keuchel said Tuesday. "You go on throughout your day, sometimes it's hard to put a face to a name or a name to a face. And it was nice to get everybody out together.
"Spring training is tough because (there are) so many bodies. (I) thought about doing it for just the pitchers (and) catchers. But then I was like, 'Well, I don't really know a whole lot of people, so let's get to know some of these minor-league guys and give them a taste of what a big-league dinner is all about.' "
According to the report, every player in the major-league clubhouse, attendants, trainers, equipment managers, secretaries, bat boys and the entire coaching staff and front office were invited. There were close to 125 people, including wives and girlfriends, at a cost of about $25,000.
"I got a lot of help from (director of team travel) Ed (Cassin), and he did a great job," Keuchel said. "We gave guys about four or five days' notice. It was a family event; you could bring your kids or whatever. It was mainly just, 'Hey, let's have some fun for a couple hours and show up at the ballpark early again.'
"I told Ed I wanted the whole menu available. Obviously, with 150 to 200 people, it's kind of tough for the kitchen. So they had a pre-made menu, but it was really nice and we had open bar and open wine. Nobody really went out of control. I was hoping some guys did just for the sake of it."
Keuchel signed a three-year, $55.5 million deal with the Sox in the offseason.
According to the report, Keuchel's mother, Teresa, told the team, "Playoffs or die," with an expletive added.
"I had her say that it's the playoffs or die this year," Keuchel said. "And she added the choice words at the end I had her say for the sake of humor."
2. James McCann is enjoying the reunion with his old college teammate.
Dallas Keuchel expressed joy in having the chance to pitch to former college teammate James McCann on Monday against the Padres. They were teammates at Arkansas in 2009.
McCann also got a kick out of the reunion.
"It was a lot of fun," McCann said Tuesday. "He threw the ball really well. Catching him in college is something that I'll always remember, especially now where we are in our careers, being able to look back. Those are fond memories. I definitely enjoy being able to catch him more than having to hit off him, I know that."
McCann has handled the bulk of catching duties with the regulars during exhibition games as Yasmani Grandal continues to recover from a mild left calf strain.
The Sox, meanwhile, signed reliever Zach Putnam to a minor-league contract. The right-hander is in the minor-league camp. Putnam has spent portions of seven seasons in the majors, including with the Sox in 2014-17. He last pitched in the majors in 2017.
3. The Sox are taking precautionary steps with coronavirus.
Rick Renteria said Major League Baseball has offered guidance about precautionary steps for the possible spread of coronavirus.
"Major League Baseball has put out something for all of us just to be aware of in terms of washing our hands, coughing into your sleeve, try to stay away from shaking too many people's hands," Renteria said. "(Pound) knuckles a little bit more.
"Obviously everyone is concerned because you don't want anything like that to occur and you don't want to spread it. Just being mindful, hygiene-wise, and make sure that you're mindful of others as well."

Apple Supplier Foxconn Foresees Rebound in China

Foxconn Technology Group, which assembles iPhones for Apple Inc., expects production levels at its plants in mainland China to return to normal seasonal level this month if the coronavirus epidemic doesn't worsen, the company's chairman said Tuesday.
Like many manufacturers in China, Foxconn extended the Lunar New Year holiday that began in January as the coronavirus outbreak worsened. The company resumed production in recent weeks, but its biggest challenge has been a shortage of workers, said Chairman Young-Way Liu. To curb the spread of infections, the Chinese government has restricted the movements of at least half a billion residents in more than 100 cities through lockdowns and travel restrictions.
Apple declined to comment. During an interview with Fox Business Network last week, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Apple had reopened factories and was ramping up production.
In February, Apple became the first major U.S. company to say it wouldn't meet its revenue projections for the current quarter due to the epidemic, which it said had limited production of iPhones -- its biggest-selling product -- for world-wide sales and weighed on demand for its products in China.
Foxconn's production in China has reached 50% of its seasonally required capacity, Mr. Liu said in a call with investors, adding that logistics conditions have improved recently. Foxconn's required production capacity varies by season as demand for many electronic products like the iPhone peaks around the winter holiday season.
The recent crippling of factories in China due to the epidemic has again cast a spotlight on Apple's heavy reliance on China, where it assembles most of its products, raising questions among analysts and investors over whether Apple should diversify its production sites. Over the last two years, Apple has also faced the fallout from the trade war between the U.S. and China that included tariffs on certain made-in-China goods.
Mr. Liu said the U.S.-China trade war has already pushed Taiwan-based Foxconn to look beyond China in the long run. He also said the likelihood of Foxconn shifting production out of China is higher if President Trump is re-elected.
Foxconn is eyeing Southeast Asia as a destination of future expansions, Mr. Liu said. It has been expanding in Vietnam and India, and has plants in Mexico, Brazil and other countries.
Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., says it is the biggest private-sector employer in China. To bring back workers to its plants, including major iPhone assembling sites in Zhengzhou and Shenzhen, Foxconn has been offering cash bonuses of more than $750 for those coming to work there. Many local governments have also organized group transportation for migrant workers.

Energy Shares' Rebound Is Derailed

Worries about fallout from the coronavirus are pummeling already-battered energy stocks, upending a nascent recovery that followed a spate of better-than-expected earnings and dividend increases and signaling the magnitude of investors' concern about the virus's effect on crude demand.
Energy shares in the S&P 500 have fallen significantly more than the broader index's other groups, losing 7.4% in the past five sessions while the broader index fell 4%. The sector also lagged behind stocks and U.S. crude Tuesday, finishing down 3.1% compared with the index's 2.8% decline.
Investors are still trying to gauge the magnitude of the virus's hit on oil demand, as the epidemic picks up outside China. The epidemic has already tamped down oil demand, with countries taking steps to dissuade or restrict travel to and from China, the world's top importer of crude, as well as other countries experiencing a bump in cases.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about energy demand right now," said Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at energy investment firm Tortoise.
Energy stocks are closely tied to oil prices, which have fallen more than 20% this year. Last week, U.S. crude futures suffered their biggest percentage drop since the financial crisis. They rose Monday and again on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate to mitigate the virus's hit on the economy. By the end of the day, prices had trimmed most of their intraday gains.
Even before the coronavirus epidemic, investors were skittish about the sector, which has been the worst performer in the S&P 500 for the past two years. Producers have promised to pull back on crude production to ease a global glut and prop up prices, but few investors expect a quick recovery. Net bets on rising crude prices by hedge funds and other speculative investors recently hit their lowest level since October, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
"Energy companies are the first thing people look to sell in times like these," said Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Management.
Here is how the ripples from the virus have spread through energy stocks:
Exploration-and-production stocks have had a particularly rough stretch. Shares of Devon Energy Corp. and Cimarex Energy Co. have declined more than 11% in the past five sessions, while Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Diamondback Energy Inc. have fallen 8% or more. The SPDR S&P Oil &Gas Exploration &Production exchange-traded fund has lost 11% in that time.
Companies providing services and equipment to the oil-and-gas industry are also getting battered by concerns that sinking demand for crude will hurt business. Shares of Halliburton Co. have fallen 16% in the past five sessions, while Baker Hughes Co. has shed 11% and Schlumberger NV has lost 8.6%. The VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF has declined more than 8%.
Companies that store and transport energy products weren't spared in the market rout either. Shares of Kinder Morgan Inc. have lost 5.7% since Feb. 25.
Major refining businesses are also hurting, with shares of Valero Energy Corp. and Phillips 66 falling more than 12% in the past five sessions due to concerns about lower demand for petroleum products.
Shares of the biggest energy companies have also fallen in the past week but generally less than others in the sector. Chevron Corp. lost 6.3% since Feb. 25, while Exxon Mobil Corp. lost more than 5%. BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have both fallen more than 3%.
"Some of the larger energy companies have the balance sheets to withstand this period," said Kevin Holt, senior portfolio manager for Invesco Ltd., which has more than $1 trillion in assets under management and owns shares in some major shale producers.
In fact, he sees the recent slide as a buying opportunity.
"We were sitting tight until [Thursday], then we started buying energy companies," said Mr. Holt. "With the coronavirus, we've got a group that was already inexpensive going at fire-sale prices."

Currencies: Volatility Surges as Forecasts Are Upset

The coronavirus epidemic has delivered a jolt to previously sleepy foreign-exchange markets.
Currency trading had mostly been calm in recent years, as a degree of certainty about the outlook for U.S. interest rates and other factors, such as the low cost of insurance against major foreign-exchange moves, suppressed volatility.
The fast-spreading virus has interrupted that equability. The Cboe/CME FX Euro Volatility Index, a measure of expected turbulence in the dollar-euro futures market derived from options prices, has surged 21% over the past week, extending this year's advance to 44%.
The Cboe gauge of implied volatility in the dollar-yen futures market has risen even further, jumping 72% in 2020. Japan's yen has moved up or down an average of 0.44% against the dollar in the spot market since the start of February, according to FactSet, almost double the average daily swing of 0.24% that took place in the preceding 12 months.
One reason why volatility has returned: The epidemic led investors to predict that the Federal Reserve would shift course and lower borrowing costs, instead of maintaining rates at current levels. They were proved right Tuesday when it cut its target interest rate by half a percentage point -- the first rate reduction to take place between scheduled meetings since the financial crisis -- to shield the economy from a potential downturn in global growth.
This change of direction has upended bets that rates would remain significantly higher in the U.S. than in other major economies.
The gap between expected borrowing costs in different economies often, though not always, dictates moves in currency markets because money managers typically seek to invest where they think they can earn the greatest returns.
"One of the drivers of low volatility was the expectation of interest rates from central banks to be on hold for the foreseeable future," said Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura. "Now we have the potential for central-bank rate cuts, predominantly from the Federal Reserve in the U.S., and this would narrow the interest-rate differential between the U.S. and its partners."
As the threat of a pandemic began to loom last week, stock markets reeled and economists slashed their forecasts for global growth in 2020.
The Bank of Japan, Bank of England and European Central Bank have all said they stand ready to tackle the economic and financial impact of the coronavirus.
The Fed has more room to reduce borrowing costs because it currently targets a higher rate of interest than policy makers in Japan, the eurozone and the U.K.
Finance ministers and central-bank governors from the Group of Seven countries said Tuesday they were prepared to cooperate to guard against economic risks stemming from the epidemic, though they stopped short of stating specific actions.
With less certainty about the gap between rates set by different central banks, option sellers have pushed up the price of insuring against currency moves, Mr. Rochester said. In turn, that has boosted the level of implied volatility.
Currency swings have also become more pronounced in emerging markets, many of which are closely tied to China's economy through commodity exports and supply chains. Implied volatility for a basket of emerging-market currencies has risen 26% in 2020, according to an index calculated by JPMorgan Chase &Co.
Still, currencies remain calmer than stocks. The Cboe Volatility Index, a gauge of expected turbulence in large-cap U.S. equities, has surged 135% in 2020.

The hotel industry's decadelong run of growth and rising revenue looked vulnerable at the start of the year. Now the spread of the coronavirus threatens to make it the worst-performing year since the recession.
The biggest brands have warned about how tough last month was, and how challenged the first quarter is going to be. Marriott International Inc. said during an earnings call last week that revenue per available room for Greater China, which represents about 9% of the company's total room count, plunged nearly 90% in February compared with a year earlier.
Hilton had estimated that the coronavirus epidemic will hurt its full-year adjusted earnings by $25 million to $50 million, assuming the epidemic lasts around three to six months. Hyatt Hotels Corp. President Mark Hoplamazian said hotels in Singapore, Japan, and the Indonesian island of Bali reported declines in recent bookings, driven by a sharp pullback in Chinese travel.
"So I would say we've seen it radiate across the globe," Mr. Hoplamazian said on an earnings call on Feb. 20.
On Monday, Hyatt said in a release it was withdrawing its previously announced 2020 outlook following corporate travel restrictions in North America and Europe and cancellations outside of Greater China. "This is an evolving situation, and our ability to assess the financial impact of [coronavirus] on our business continues to be limited due to quickly changing circumstances and uncertain consumer demand for travel," Mr. Hoplamazian said in a statement.
Hotel share prices reflected that gloomy outlook. Marriott shares dropped 22.59% from Feb. 19 through Tuesday, compared with the S&P 500's 11.3% decline. Hilton and Hyatt shares slid more than 17%.
Lodging real-estate investment trusts, which have little overseas exposure, sold off anyway. The Dow Jones US Hotel &Lodging REIT Index fell 19.01%.
By the weekend, the travel outlook seemed to be deteriorating further. "Over the past 72 hours we have been hearing rapidly increasing chatter from our private hotel owner, property manager, and corporate travel contacts of travel restrictions, meeting cancellations and/or poor meeting attendance," C. Patrick Scholes, a senior lodging analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc., wrote in a Sunday client note.
While most of the events that have been canceled or postponed were scheduled abroad, some U.S. groups recently have called off events, too. Organizers of a cargo-shipping trade conference -- expected to attract more than 2,000 participants to Long Beach, Calif., during the first week of March -- canceled and cited the virus, according to a Saturday notice on the organizer's website.
Even if coronavirus is contained soon, the damage to the hospitality business could reverberate for a while, analysts said. After events like SARS and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, companies tend to take at least two to three years to make up for the losses, Mr. Scholes said.
The U.S. lodging industry has enjoyed a powerful rebound over the past 10 years, with both occupancy levels and daily room rates reaching all-time highs last year, according to hotel data tracker STR. But in January, STR forecast growth in revenue per available room, or RevPAR, a crucial industry metric, as flat for the year. That was the first time since 2009 that STR predicted a year without RevPAR growth.
Weaker U.S. economic growth and competition from short-term rental companies are hurting hotel pricing power and keeping room rates in check, said Ryan Meliker, president of Lodging Analytics Research &Consulting, a hotel data and forecasting firm. In a number of major markets, including New York City, Nashville, Tenn., and Miami, new supply growth is also an issue.
Jan Freitag, a senior vice president at STR, said some travel bookings lost in the first quarter may be gone for good, like group events that recently canceled. Corporate travel also looks challenging for the moment. "I would not be surprised to see some companies cut travel to zero," he said.
If there is a bright spot, it is that leisure travel tends to snap back once a global virus or other threat comes under control. "Leisure demand will decline sharply, but we have seen it always comes back rather quickly," Mr. Freitag said.

Banking &amp; Finance: Home Refinancing Looks Attractive, but First Do the Math

Worries about coronavirus have battered stocks and sent investors fleeing to the safety of U.S. government debt.
On Tuesday, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury dropped below 1% for the first time and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate to a range between 1% and 1.25%.
Mortgage rates are expected to fall along with those yields. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.45% during the week of Feb. 27, according to Freddie Mac, and the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 2.95%.
If the yield on the 10-year Treasury declines even further, mortgage rates could drop more, too, though they don't always move in lockstep with the government benchmark.
"This opens up a whole new world of refinancing for mortgage borrowers," said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry research group. "It's a matter of time in terms of how fast lenders lower their rates to reflect a 10-year [U.S. Treasury note] and it's also a question of how fast they want to go to that level, but at a minimum, we're talking mortgage rates at 3.25% if not below 3% in the next few weeks, if everything stays the same -- and frankly, that would be a once-in-a-lifetime refinancing opportunity."
Whether it makes sense to refinance a mortgage now comes down to a host of personal factors. It depends, for example, on the cost of a refi, how long you plan to stay in your home, how much you hope to save, what you think your house is worth -- and your view of the world economy.
"Yields have fallen quite steeply and the reason is that there's concerns about a big slowdown in the global economy, largely because of the coronavirus," said Kathy Jones, senior vice president and chief fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.
For those considering a refi now, first look at the difference, or spread, between the current rate and the rate in the market. Then looks at costs, as a refinancing means paying significant closing costs -- including title insurance and an appraisal -- which can often amount to a few thousand dollars.
If the potential saving from a lower-rate mortgage doesn't make up for those costs, it may not make sense to refinance just yet. "The old rule of thumb used to be two years," Mr. Cecala said. "If you can pay it back within two years and you expect to be in the house five years, then why not do it?"
Rates have fallen before, so those who wait to refinance could potentially see even better ones. As the coronavirus continues to develop and its effects are felt around the globe, Mr. Cecala said the mortgage market could see even more changes.
Lauri Droster, branch director at RBC Wealth Management in Madison, Wis., suggests considering a refinance if there's a difference somewhere between one-half a percentage point or 1 percentage point.
Ms. Droster said it's easier for people to understand the potential saving when they make it personal. Calculate how refinancing could affect monthly mortgage payments rather than simply looking at the percentage difference and examining it in an abstract way.
"When they see it in real dollars, then they can make that comparison," she said. "That's where they can really see what it means, when they can see it in dollars and say, 'I'm paying $1,500 a month right now for my mortgage and 1% lower is down to $1,200 a month.'"
For those with adjustable-rate mortgages, however, Mr. Cecala recommends borrowers check how often their rate adjusts. Most only do so once every six or 12 months, in which case some homeowners might want to refinance from an ARM to a fixed-rate, he said, to lock into low rates.
"If you're saying, 'I'm planning on being in this home for the next five years, and I don't want to worry about what's happening with interest rates,' that's pretty much a no-brainer," he said.
Those with high loan-to-value ratios may not be able to refinance. But Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac, said that with home values steadily rising over the past decade, this circumstance is rare.
Dan Egan, managing director of behavioral finance at Betterment, is himself considering refinancing his house. To him, the move makes sense because he and his wife have decided to also shorten the period of their loan from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year mortgage. Their net monthly payments could be higher as a result, but he'd be paying lower interest rates over a shorter time. His tax situation wouldn't change as "the standard deduction is high enough."

Oil Prices Pull Back After Early Gains

U.S. crude prices pared most of their earlier gains Tuesday after the Federal Reserve's interest-rate cut failed to allay investors' concerns about an economic fallout from the coronavirus epidemic.
Last week, West Texas Intermediate futures logged their biggest one-week percentage drop since the financial crisis. They rose Monday and again Tuesday after the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate by a half percentage point in a bid to mitigate the virus's hit on the economy.
But by the end of the day, they had trimmed most of their intraday gains. Brent, the global gauge of prices, pared all of its advance from earlier in the day.
U.S. crude prices ended the day up 0.9% at $47.18 a barrel, while Brent edged down less than 0.1% and settled at $51.86 a barrel.
Although the Fed's move could soften potential economic disruptions due to the virus, which could help prop up oil demand, analysts had cautioned investors to expect continued volatility in crude prices.
"While lower rates would marginally reduce costs of carrying oil inventory, this factor is modest in relation to the dramatic cut in petroleum demand that is currently being seen around the world," analysts at Ritterbusch &Associates wrote in a Tuesday note.
The Fed's move followed an announcement by finance ministers and central-bank governors from Group of Seven countries that they were ready to take steps to contain the economic fallout of the coronavirus epidemic.
Investors are also waiting to see whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will agree on further production cuts this week.
Elsewhere in commodities, front-month gold futures rose 3.1% to $1,642.10 a troy ounce, their largest one-day percentage increase since June.

Fed Cuts Rates Amid Virus Fears --- Stocks, bond yields fall after central bank takes biggest emergency action since '08 crisis

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve executed an emergency half-percentage-point rate cut and markets slid, reflecting fears the coronavirus epidemic is raising recession risks for the U.S. and global economies.
The Fed reduced the federal-funds rate to a range between 1% and 1.25% in the first rate change in between scheduled Fed policy meetings since the 2008 financial crisis. Stock markets fell anyway. Major market indexes declined around 3% and the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury dipped below 1% for the first time as investors sought havens.
The central bank has typically reserved such moves for times when the economic outlook has quickly darkened, as in early 2001 and early 2008, when the U.S. economy was heading into recession.
Recession risks have risen enough to "warrant a Federal Reserve shock-and-awe approach," said Tiffany Wilding, an economist at Pacific Investment Management Co.
The market's moves Tuesday showed the extent to which investors worry the central bank can't on its own prevent a drop-off in confidence and spending without a commanding response from public-health authorities and other government agencies.
The rate cut was approved unanimously by the Fed's rate-setting committee, which met by videoconference on Monday night. In a statement, officials held out the prospect of additional stimulus by pledging to "act as appropriate" to support the economy.
Fed officials moved to prevent a pullback in credit availability to households and businesses that could amplify any slowdown in U.S. growth, especially if steps to mitigate the spread of the virus -- school and business closures, canceled public events and changed social behavior, broadly speaking -- curtail spending and depress hiring.
"The virus and measures being taken to contain it will weigh on economic activity here and abroad for some time," Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference Tuesday.
The Fed's response shows how policy makers are bracing for greater economic distress from a contagious, flulike virus than seemed possible just a week ago.
In China, where nearly 3,000 people have died since the initial outbreak there, steps to contain its spread prompted steep declines in production. The coronavirus has infected more than 10,000 people outside China.
The epidemic roiled global financial markets last week amid signs containment efforts were jeopardized by new clusters in Italy, Iran and South Korea. Stocks posted their largest weekly losses since the 2008 financial crisis. Commodity prices fell, signaling a hit to global demand, and long-term U.S. government-bond yields reached record lows, reflecting lower growth expectations and investors seeking havens.
"The concern was that by the time they got to the meeting, things could have spiraled far enough that they would have a much bigger problem," said William English, a former senior Fed economist who now teaches at Yale University, referring to the Fed's scheduled March 17-18 policy meeting.
Positive test results for infections in the U.S. last weekend further raised the prospect of changes to behaviors that could lead to a drop in consumer spending, especially travel, tourism and entertainment.
Even if any shock is temporary, there are big unknowns over how long it will last and how deep output might decline. While an interest-rate cut won't address the cause of the downturn, Mr. Powell said he hoped it could soften damage to spending and confidence, stem financial-market disruptions and speed a recovery once any epidemic is under control.
"A rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection. It won't fix a broken supply chain. We get that," Mr. Powell said. "But we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy."
When the Fed cut rates three times last year, officials characterized those moves as an insurance policy against the risk of a global slowdown amplified by the U.S.-China trade war. Because the source of the latest shock isn't primarily economic, it could be more difficult for interest-rate policy to buoy consumer spending and confidence.
"Finance didn't start this thing. It's not the Asian debt crisis. It's not a currency crisis, a mortgage crisis. It's not from Fed policy being too tight," said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at research firm TS Lombard.
Mr. Blitz said it was reasonable to expect a short but swift downturn that would reverse by the summer, once the impact of the virus fades. But he added it was difficult to tell if other fissures in the economy might now surface after an 11-year rally in the stock market accompanied by a corporate-lending boom, all underwritten by lower interest rates.
"The risk is that whenever any recession takes hold, a different reality can emerge from what caused it once unaccounted-for excesses underlying the U.S. economy are laid bare," he said.
A separate risk is that the Fed's response won't be effective without a robust response by public-health authorities that maintains confidence in the nation's ability to contain or mitigate the spread of illness.
Even then, steps to limit outbreaks could lead to changes in social behavior that temporarily depresses spending and curtails hiring. That could lead weak businesses to fail and distressed households to fall behind on monthly payments.
"Right now the public health response is the most important. How effective are they treating people?" said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist who is now economic-policy director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank. "The Fed is not going to be the lead policy lever."
President Trump in recent days called on the Fed to cut rates and said he was disappointed the central bank didn't do more on Tuesday, repeating his longstanding preference for U.S. borrowing costs to be lower than other advanced economies, including those with negative rates.
Mr. English said while he was confident the Fed wasn't being swayed by political pressure, there is a risk that the central bank's credibility suffers because not everyone will see it that way.
After Tuesday's cut, investors expected the Fed would lower rates again in the coming weeks, including at the March meeting.
Fed officials repeatedly said last year it would be important to act aggressively at the first sign of a downturn in spending or hiring because they have less room to counteract a recession by cutting rates.
Fed officials are likely to look for evidence that businesses not directly affected by the virus are seeing a weakening of demand as they plot their next move. "Are households and businesses hunkering down to see how this goes? If they see that, the Fed would provide more accommodation," Mr. English said.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Banks' cross-border trading businesses actually improved as tariffs went up and trade wars loomed. The novel coronavirus won't be so accommodating.
During the protracted U.S.-China trade roller coaster over the past two years, which saw disruptions in the usual cross-border patterns, the business of providing loans and other financing for overseas commerce enjoyed its best stretch in years. The biggest banks' trade-finance revenue grew over 2018 and 2019, according to new figures from industry tracker Coalition. That compares with a decline of more than 20% from 2014 to 2017.
The threat of a trade war counterintuitively led to things like cross-border operators paying their banks for a form of insurance that trading partners would pay up and also for help financing new trade routes. That was a nice countervailing tailwind for banks at a time when interest rates were falling -- sometimes going negative -- and when corporate clients were cautious about big new investments.
By contrast, the disruptions to cross-border trade and supply chains stemming from global efforts to halt the spread of the new coronavirus are likely to hurt the trade-finance businesses. Trade isn't rerouting or becoming more expensive -- it just may not happen. For example, the largest U.S. gateway for seaborne China imports is estimating a 25% drop in volume for February. Plunging oil prices also are linked to lower values for letters of credit. Coalition research director Eric Li says he believes that in the aggregate, the biggest trade banks are likely preparing for a decline of 5% to 10% in trade-finance revenue in the first quarter. It is a big pool of fees for the biggest banks, at $5.9 billion in 2019.
Exposure to trade-finance revenue is heavily weighted toward European banks. As of the end of 2018, the top tier of trade-finance banks were Citigroup, HSBC Holdings, BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole, according to Coalition's league-table ranking. In the second tier were Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered.
What may be a more acute situation is if banks sharply limit the provision of trade financing to clients, such as buying invoices as a way to provide clients with cash to keep operating. The World Trade Organization estimates 80% of global trade requires a credit or guarantee to take place. A situation in which banks are protecting their balance sheets or can't unload that credit to investors would deprive the global supply chain of vital fuel.
This is yet another reason that anticipation of a pandemic, and not just a pandemic itself, is something for markets to consider.

Airport Stores Suffer Amid a Decline in Terminal Foot Traffic

Airport retail outlets have been a rare success story in the slumping bricks-and-mortar world. Now, duty-free and other airport shops are getting hit hard from the impact of the coronavirus epidemic.
Airport terminal stores have become havens of high-end shopping, with travelers buying luxury goods, liquor or perfume often on a whim or as last-minute presents.
Travelers from Asia in particular have made duty-free shopping sprees an essential part of their itinerary. Brands such as Estee Lauder now have higher sales at major airports than in North American department stores. L'Oreal SA said revenue at its travel retail division, which occupies 9% of its global sales, rose 25% last year, making the division one of the French cosmetics company's fastest-growing channels.
But these stores are being pummeled since the coronavirus epidemic began, as foot traffic drops at airports popular with international tourists. Airport retail at some of the major Asian hubs has tumbled 60% to 70%, according to the Moodie Davitt Report, a travel retail-intelligence service provider.
"This is the greatest crisis the travel retail sector has faced, worse than [severe acute respiratory syndrome], the two Gulf wars or various financial crises," said Martin Moodie, chairman of the report. "That's largely driven by the fact that the Chinese traveler has become the epicenter of the sector over recent years and many retailers are worryingly reliant on them."
In a February survey of more than 1,000 international travelers from the U.S., U.K., Australia and Asia who are regular duty-free shoppers, more than one-third said they would spend less time in a store, not make a purchase if they need to wait in line, and would be less likely to touch or pick up items, according to U.K.-based travel-research specialist Pi Insight.
"There's a high portion of travelers who want to go straight to the departure gate," said Stephen Hillam, managing director at Pi Insight.
Transport authorities in Singapore and Thailand began to offer rent relief in February to retail, dining and service operators for a period of six months to a year, to help defray costs and protect jobs.
In Hong Kong, the airport authority said it is expanding an earlier relief package first extended in September to help retail and catering outlets, airlines, ground handling agents and other support-service companies. In total, these relief measures, including rent adjustments and concessions, are expected to reach 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$205 million).
Airport foot traffic in San Francisco fell 15% in February, compared with a year earlier, and declined 20% at Los Angeles International Airport, according to geolocation data platform Advan Research.
At Terminal 1 of New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, food-court vendors and retailers such as Hudson News said daily revenues have fallen as much as 50% in recent weeks as passenger traffic has plunged. China Eastern Airlines, Air China, Korean Air and Japan Airlines fly out of Terminal 1, making it the worst-hit among the airport's terminals because flight suspensions have been more concentrated there, said Vivian Shi, manager of Wok &Roll, a vendor that sells Chinese food.
"Now we're making $1,000 to $2,000 a day, compared to $4,000 on regular days and $8,000 on exceptionally good days," said Ms. Shi.
Mall landlord Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield SE, which operates stores and restaurants at airports in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, said those outlets face lower foot traffic. But the company added only one tenant, in New York, has requested shorter hours, and none has asked for rent relief.

An attorney announced Tuesday that his firm represents more than 40 people, including two former football players and an ex-hockey player, in the University of Michigan sexual abuse case.
Parker Stinar told the Associated Press that one of his new clients helped the Wolverines win the 1997 national championship in football and one went on to play in the NHL.
The university's president has apologized to "anyone who was harmed" by Dr. Robert E. Anderson, set up a hotline for others who have information to come forward and offered counseling services to those affected.
Denver-based Wahlberg, Woodruff, Nimmo &Sloane plans to host a news conference Wednesday night, following a second meeting with the school's vice president and general counsel Timothy Lynch.
Michigan officials have acknowledged some university employees were aware of accusations against the doctor before the whistleblower's 2018 complaint that led to a police investigation. The school said last week that it received more than 100 "unique complaints" about Anderson.

As virus spreads, an Airbnb conundrum; Hosts and guests sort it out one canceled visit at a time

As the coronavirus threatens to upend the travel industry, executives of hotel, airline and cruise ship companies have been forced to confront sensitive questions of how to best protect their customers and employees.
In the growing corner of the travel world occupied by Airbnb, those issues are being hashed out one home-rental host and guest at a time.
On an online message board for hosts, a man in Mumbai asked what he should do when he received an inquiry from a guest coming from China. "I am unsure if I confirm or cancel the booking," he wrote.
A host from Tacoma, Wash., wrote on the same board that she's "wiping down all door knobs, handles, light switches, and anything else that may have been touched by the previous guests." In some cases, travelers of Asian descent have reported host cancellations they see as discriminatory. And in one posting, a host in Rome wrote that a guest checked out "because next door there is a family from Asia."
"Two days before the trip, I got a message through the Airbnb app that said ... 'Hey, sorry we are afraid of coronavirus,' " said Kavi Pandian, a Fulbright scholar from outside Atlanta who had his reservation for a German Airbnb canceled. "I got the impression ... that I might not have gotten that message if it weren't clear from my profile that I was someone from Asian background."
The outbreak began late last year in China and has now spread to almost every continent. Global economic growth could be cut sharply as factories in China and elsewhere shut down, endangering supply lines. Travel and tourism might be hit especially hard as travel restrictions kick in and conventions and other large-scale gatherings are canceled.
Airbnb spokeswoman Mattie Zazueta said she did not have information on whether short-term home rental cancellations are up. But the spread of the disease comes at an inopportune moment for a company readying for an initial public offering. In a statement, Airbnb said its "focus right now is on how we can best support our stakeholders as they are impacted by this global health challenge, including hosts, guests, employees and the communities in which we operate."
The company, on its website, provides links to information about travel advisories and general information about the virus and urges people "to take necessary precautions to protect yourself when traveling or hosting."
Zazueta said the company has also directly contacted hosts in some countries "to help them stay prepared and follow best practices."
Depending on the timing of the booking, Airbnb said it would also allow guests and hosts to cancel without penalties if their booking is in mainland China or South Korea, or if guests are coming from those two nations. Usually, the host chooses a cancellation policy that sets limitations on how guests can receive a full refund.
The full-refund "extenuating circumstances" policy also applies to anyone worldwide who needs to comply with "disease control restrictions implemented by relevant governmental or health authorities," as well as people "diagnosed or suspected of being infected with COVID-19 [the virus' official name] by a medical or health authority."
That doesn't cover many people who are simply wary of getting on a crowded plane and traveling to other busy tourist destinations amid what may turn out to be a pandemic. Cancellations are hitting countries that haven't seen widespread reports of the virus.
Bogdana Butnar, who helps her elderly parents run an Airbnb in a Romanian mountain village, said two guests have already canceled, saying they have been warned against unnecessary travel.
"My expectation is this will impact this summer's booking severely," Butnar said in an email. "My parents are obviously disappointed [because] the extra income was nice and they loved having people staying at the house."
On its website laying out the cancellation policy, Airbnb also asks "that all community members be mindful of respect, inclusion, and our nondiscrimination policy when interacting with other members of our community."
Zazueta said Airbnb would "investigate all reports of discrimination and take appropriate action when necessary, including up to removal of users from the platform."
Pandian said Airbnb was very helpful, got him a full refund and gave him additional money to pay for a new place to enjoy a German festival.
But some guests consider the refund conditions arbitrary. For example, Airbnb's offer of a full refund applies to guests traveling to mainland China who are checking in April 1 or earlier. In South Korea, it applies to guests checking in March 9 or earlier.
That leaves out people such as Kevin Huynh of Corona. The 46-year-old electrical engineer booked a place in South Korea for a June family trip with his wife and two children. Concerned, they've decided to stay home.
He said Airbnb initially told him he could receive only a 50% refund, but after he pushed back, the company eventually offered a 50% refund and a 50% credit to book another trip. He said he's holding out for a full refund because he doesn't want to deal with Airbnb again after fighting with their customer service representatives.
Huynh's experience shows how Airbnb's business model can add complexity to resolving disputes at times like this. In one message, an Airbnb rep told Huynh the company's hands were tied because the host was still willing to accommodate him and refused to agree to a refund.
"Every cancellation, especially those which blocked the host's calendar dates for a few dates, are lost business opportunities" for the host, the Airbnb employee wrote. "Therefore, your host is the best person to determine if this refund request is acceptable after taking business factors into consideration."
The employee recommended that Huynh check the cancellation policy for future bookings, so "this kind of matter will be avoided in the future."
Huynh replied: "Please tell me how I can avoid knowing in advance that a global virus outbreak will occur in the country that I will be traveling to. If you can I can definitely avoid this problem in the future."
Zazueta, the Airbnb spokeswoman, said the company was sorry Huynh had a bad experience and noted it offered him a coupon as a "goodwill gesture."
She said cut-off dates for full refunds will be "updated as needed, as the situation evolves."
There could be a silver lining for some domestic hosts. John Banczak runs TurnKey Vacation Rentals, which manages full-house vacation rentals in the United States on Airbnb and other websites. He said the company saw a large jump in bookings last week, something he attributes in part to coronavirus.
"They may be backing off on international plans and they are looking for alternatives," Banczak said of vacationers.

BUSINESS BEAT; JPMorgan tests a virus plan -- telecommuting

JPMorgan Chase &Co. is asking thousands of U.S. employees to work from home as it tests a contingency plan for closing domestic offices should the coronavirus spread, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Managers requested that about 10% of staff across its consumer bank work remotely as part of the plan's resiliency testing, which has been code-named "Project Kennedy," said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. JPMorgan's consumer bank, which primarily operates in the U.S., has 127,137 employees, the most of any of the company's divisions.
Banks around the globe have been working to ensure they can keep their businesses running as the coronavirus spreads, restricting travel, splitting up teams and traders amid locations, and quarantining staff. They're also dusting off regulatory plans for keeping "critical operations" open through a potential pandemic, some of which describe things such as how far apart traders should sit from one another, or how many can work remotely. JPMorgan's leaders have been double-checking contingency plans to be sure the company can continue to serve customers in the event of widespread disruptions. For the consumer bank, testing the telecommuting policy on a sampling of employees across businesses can ensure kinks are worked out before the plan needs to be rolled out more broadly in the event of a pandemic, one of the people said.
The moves are part of broader resiliency planning at the bank. The company last week restricted nonessential international travel for all employees and has been urging workers to test their remote-access capabilities. JPMorgan has also been testing out systems at backup trading sites over the last few days in case workers need to be moved off the main trading floors in New York and London, one of the people said.
A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment.
Although technology has made it possible for a growing number of professionals to do their jobs remotely, working from home generally isn't an option for branch workers such as tellers and bankers who deal directly with customers. JPMorgan had 4,976 branches around the country as of the end of December that are filled with thousands of employees who have to show up to work for business to run.
The bank is providing extra hand sanitizer to customer-facing branch workers and taking extra steps to sanitize offices, branches and equipment, including elevator call buttons and door handles, according to a memo from Co-President Gordon Smith to consumer bank staff Friday. JPMorgan also is encouraging consumers to access bank services and products through digital channels instead of walking into branches when they can.
"This can make their life easier all the time," Smith wrote.

One investor decided he might fly to Idaho, with or without family. Other wealthy folks, wanting a cure, were being soothed by a doctor in a Colorado ski town. And one New Yorker called up the hospital with his name on it.
Like everyone across the U.S., the wealthy are bracing for a deadly coronavirus outbreak.
Ken Langone, co-founder of Home Depot Inc., watched President Trump's news conference and wondered if the media was overplaying the risk -- but he also made two well-placed phone calls from his winter outpost in North Palm Beach, Fla. One was to a top executive of NYU Langone Health, and the other was to a top scientist there. Both were reassuring.
"What I've been told by people who are smarter than me in disease is, as of right now it's a bad flu," said Langone, an 84-year-old who loves capitalism so much that he wrote a book called "I Love Capitalism!"
He plans to come back to New York this month for an appointment. If he happens to feel sick, he will go to NYU Langone; he said he'd expect no special treatment. Some billionaires, bankers and other members of the U.S. elite are calm, others are getting anxious, and everyone is washing their hands. But the rich can afford to prepare for a pandemic with perquisites, such as private plane rides out of town, calls to world-leading experts and access to luxurious medical care.
Tim Kruse, a doctor who makes house calls in Aspen, Colo., said, "The wealthy aren't going to necessarily have access to things that the common person is not going to have access to." But that hasn't stopped them from asking if they can get their hands on a coronavirus vaccine. "The answer is no. They just want to know."
Confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide are nearing 93,000, and more than 3,100 people have died.
The World Health Organization raised its global risk assessment for the illness to "very high." Fear over the economic fallout has upended global markets, plunging Treasury yields to all-time lows and giving the Standard &Poor's 500 index its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis.
One co-founder of a major hedge fund, who asked not to be named discussing his plans, said he'd run in the other direction if his peers started fleeing into doomsday bunkers. He might fly to a house he has in Italy, a country that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises Americans to avoid. Widespread panic, he added, would only make plane tickets cheaper.
Charles Stevenson, an investor who was the longtime board president at a Park Avenue co-op that's home to several billionaires, has been staying in Southampton, N.Y.
"I don't feel concerned at the moment -- it's not near me right now," Stevenson said. "If people in the village have coronavirus, I'd get out of here." He'd fly to Idaho and close himself off in a cabin, he said, and his family could join him if they wanted. "That becomes a personal choice of theirs."
Wealthy couples who aren't used to actually spending time together are in for trouble, said Mitchell Moss, who studies urban policy and planning at New York University.
"This is going to destroy the marriages of the rich," Moss said. "All these husbands and wives who travel will now have to spend time with the person they're married to."
Trump has predicted the virus will disappear "like a miracle," while Democrats outlined demands for funding that included a guarantee of an affordable vaccine. Face masks don't effectively prevent members of the general public from catching coronavirus, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said, but healthcare providers could be at risk if they can't get them. "Seriously people," Adams wrote on Twitter, "Stop buying masks!"
Jewel Mullen, associate dean for health equity at the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas in Austin, said millions of Americans couldn't afford to stock up on supplies, miss work or have a steady doctor to call for advice.
"Resources such as money, transportation and information give people head starts on protective and preventive measures, and can help create more comfortable scenarios for people to cope with disasters," said Mullen, an internist and epidemiologist who was commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Public Health.
JPMorgan Chase &Co., the biggest U.S. bank, stopped employees from going on any nonessential business trips. It joined other corporate giants in restricting travel, splitting up teams and traders to different locations, or quarantining staff. Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief executive, said not long before the announcement that he had dreamed he and other billionaires contracted the virus during January's World Economic Forum in Switzerland.
"I had this nightmare that somehow, in Davos, all of us who went there got it, and then we all left and spread it," Dimon said at the bank's annual investor day. "The only good news from that is that it might have just killed the elite."
His audience chuckled.

Until now, President Trump's approach to healthcare was alarming chiefly to discrete populations such as low-income families, immigrants, people with preexisting conditions and seniors.
They were in the crosshairs of initiatives to hamstring Medicaid, prevent undocumented residents from seeking medical treatment, destroy the Affordable Care Act and raise the cost of Medicare.
But the world has been changed by the novel coronavirus. Now it's clear that all these initiatives present a healthcare threat to everyone.
They stand in the way of comprehensive screening and treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Trump's hostility to public health programs blinds his administration to how to use the tools already at hand to combat the threat. Precedent exists for using Medicare to bring expensive medical services to Americans -- of any age, not just 65 and older -- who can't access them any other way. Will the Trump administration get the message? It's doubtful.
The administration has treated proposals for universal healthcare with unalloyed disdain, even though any such system would give the government the ability to fight an emerging pandemic such as COVID-19 by taking over the cost from states and families. Instead, officials such as Seema Verma, director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has gone on the road to attack proposals such as "Medicare for all" and the public option as "radical socialist ideas."
Medicaid is perhaps the prime target of the Trump healthcare wrecking crew. The Trump administration wants to hobble Medicaid by converting it to a block-grant program. The coronavirus shows exactly why that idea would be sheer folly.
Medicaid is the nation's largest public healthcare program, with more than 71 million enrollees as of the end of 2019. Because the federal government covers at least 50% and as much as 90% of states' expenditures for those enrollees, it's ideal for delivering the kind of services that will be urgently needed as COVID-19 spreads across the country.
It's also uniquely flexible. States are responsible for enrollments and treatments, and states hand the bills over to the feds for the appropriate reimbursement.
That allows Medicaid funding to rise or fall with need, responding to unforeseen shocks.
In the past, such shocks have included storms including Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, new and expensive technologies such as hepatitis C cures or disease outbreaks like Zika -- or COVID-19.
Block grants don't respond to shocks. Under an administration proposal made official Jan. 30, states would receive a lump sum for Medicaid based on their past experience. If their spending came in below the lump sum, they could pocket the difference for spending on other health programs; if it exceeded the block grant, they'd be on the hook for the excess, 100%.
The danger here is obvious. COVID-19 is almost certain to drive up screening and treatment costs in almost every state. To contain its spread, many residents will have to be tested. Some will have to be quarantined in hospital wards, served by medical professionals with specialized equipment.
Under the best circumstances, the public health infrastructure of even affluent states will be tested; in poor states, it will face utter collapse. If they're reliant on Medicaid to help cover the cost, they'll be sunk.
The administration proposal does offer a relief valve in the event of "unforeseen circumstances out of the state's control, such as a public health crisis." But it's not a simple fix.
As the proposal sets forth, states will have the "opportunity to submit new information and relevant data, describe the circumstances and proposed amendment, and renegotiate relevant [terms and conditions]. The data provided by the state will be validated" by federal Medicaid officials "in consultation with other appropriate federal entities."
That sounds like a six-month process, or more. As health insurance expert David Anderson observes, "If there is widespread community infection and plenty of people unexpectedly being admitted to hospitals for significant care, things could get expensive fast in an unanticipated manner."
Medicaid block grants, however, would create "a lag and an uncertainty on the part of a state as to whether a public health crisis will have additional federal funding under a proposed Medicaid block grant. Under current rules, the new, unexpected claims are submitted to CMS and the funds show up in the normal course of business. The uncertainty would cast a pall on decision makers."
The block-grant proposal was issued before COVID-19 struck. Proof of its folly couldn't have come faster.
That's true too of the administration's other favorite initiative on Medicaid, which is the imposition of work requirements.
Although work rules have been blocked in federal court, the proposals, originally implemented by Arkansas and contemplated by Kansas and other states, would have thrown enrollees off the program for failing to work a minimum number of hours a months or documenting their work histories. Even worse, the proposals would have locked people out of Medicaid for months if they breached the rules.
All this is especially worrisome because the target population for Medicaid could be especially susceptible to the spread of COVID-19. In the cities, low-income neighborhoods tend to be more densely populated, making it harder to isolate patients. They have less access to medical treatment.
Trump has further undermined the ability of public health programs to reach them by imposing the so-called public charge rule, which penalizes immigrants -- documented and otherwise -- for utilizing public assistance programs, such as Medicaid. If one were determined to spread COVID-19 as fast as possible, driving a susceptible population underground and depriving them of treatment would be a perfect way to do it.
Meanwhile, Trump has taken steps to undermine an important instrument for getting treatment, especially a vaccine, to the public. That's the Affordable Care Act, which requires that insurers provide certain preventive vaccines to their members without co-pays or deductibles. A COVID-19 vaccine, once it's available, would almost certainly make the list, as do seasonal flu vaccines.
But if the ACA is declared unconstitutional in federal court, as the administration advocates, that mandate would disappear. Price is a significant obstacle to medical treatment in the U.S. across the board.
The Supreme Court announced Monday that it would take up the federal lawsuit aiming to overturn the law, brought by Texas and 17 other red states and supported by the Trump White House. That's being viewed as a positive development by the law's defenders, who include California and other blue states. But it means a decision probably won't be rendered until next year.
Another feature of the U.S. healthcare system that complicates the fight against the novel coronavirus is its reliance on insurance deductibles and co-pays to reduce the utilization of medical care. The idea here, favored by conservatives, is that giving patients "skin in the game" by requiring them to shoulder some of the cost of care will force them to think carefully about their healthcare choices.
As John Graves of Vanderbilt points out, however, that system makes the timing of the coronavirus "uniquely challenging." The reason is that relatively few insurance customers have hit their deductibles this early in the year. Therefore, they'll be paying more out of pocket for testing or treatment. Insurance should encourage customers to seek out services in a public health crisis, but the skin-in-the-game system discourages them instead.
Several studies have shown that deductibles and other cost-sharing tools do discourage people from seeking unnecessary treatment, but discourages them from seeking necessary treatment too.
The most important unanswered question about the Trump administration's response to COVID-19 is whether it will exploit the opportunities that exist in the national healthcare infrastructure to stem the infection's spread, or whether Trump will fixate on the response of the stock market to the crisis.
A good model for the government to follow comes from the 1970s, when Congress used Medicare to address a crisis afflicting end-stage renal disease patients. Because kidney dialysis, the condition's chief treatment, was so expensive that those patients could not obtain medical insurance at any price, Congress decreed that dialysis for patients of any age would be covered by Medicare.
Democrats in Congress may be moving in that direction. Over the weekend, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) advocated that any COVID-19 vaccine be covered by Medicare.
Schumer was reacting to the doubts expressed by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar that a vaccine would be universally affordable, but it's unclear if Schumer meant that to apply only to those over 65 and eligible for Medicare, or to everyone. It should be the latter.
The main problem with Trump's healthcare policies raised by the coronavirus crisis is its uncaring approach to the beneficiaries of the nation's healthcare programs, especially Medicaid and the ACA.
The administration treats those programs as handouts to a privileged class of low-income Americans. Last January, Verma, who as director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is Medicaid's chief, implied in a speech that the program was irrelevant to anyone who was working or healthy.
"To most of us, Medicaid is remote," she said. As I reported then, she couldn't be more wrong. Medicaid pays for roughly half of all births in the United States, covers 62% of all nursing home residents, is the largest single source of payment for mental health services and provides coverage for one-third of all children in the U.S. Medicaid, Medicare and the ACA could do so much more, if this administration focused on using them, instead of killing them.

RATE CUT FAILS TO EASE FEARS; Market jitters over virus continue as Fed takes bold step to stabilize economy and prevent downturn.

FULL TEXT
The Federal Reserve, reacting swiftly to the coronavirus' damaging blows to the economy, announced a sizable interest rate cut Tuesday -- the first such emergency rate action since the Great Recession more than a decade ago.
The Fed's move -- along with a coordinated global economic response reminiscent of the dark days of the 2007-08 financial crisis -- gave an initial boost to stocks, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising almost 700 points.
But it fell almost as quickly, reflecting the depth of concern about the virus' potential reach and economic effect, as well as whether lower interest rates or other government actions can help in the face of the mysterious and highly infectious disease.
The Dow ended the day down 786 points, a nearly 3% drop and the ninth decline in the last 10 trading sessions.
The Fed's half-point rate cut marked a dramatic change from just a week ago, when Fed officials seemed content to take a wait-and-see approach. But since then, there has been mounting angst in the United States that the spreading virus could do serious harm to the U.S. economy, as it has in China, where the outbreak began.
Rising numbers of coronavirus cases -- and the first deaths -- in the U.S. have caused increasing health concerns and deepening pessimism about the economy. A growing number of U.S. companies have warned of lower earnings because of their exposure to China and disruptions to global supply chains, as well as a slowdown in travel and tourism.
"We saw a risk to the outlook for the economy and chose to act," Fed Chairman Jerome H. Powell said at a news conference shortly after the rate-cut announcement.
President Trump, who has been an ardent critic of his own Fed leader, demanded that the central bank keep lowering rates.
"The Federal Reserve is cutting but must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors," he tweeted moments after the Fed announcement. "We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA," he said, in a reference to lower interest rates in other advanced economies. "It is finally time for the Federal Reserve to LEAD. More easing and cutting!"
The Fed's announcement came as the international group consisting of the United States and six other major advanced economies, referred to as the Group of 7, issued a statement pledging to use "all appropriate tools" in response to the rising risks of a possible global pandemic.
Although the G-7 provided no specific action plan, Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin suggested the White House could soon announce steps to help small and medium-size businesses affected by the fallout from the spreading coronavirus.
Those steps are likely to include regulatory relief and a special lending facility to help offset potential increases in unemployment and bankruptcies, said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the accounting firm RSM US.
"It will soon be time for the federal government to bring out its biggest gun: fiscal firepower," he said.
Powell left open the possibility of additional rate reductions. In a statement approved unanimously, Fed policymakers said they were "closely monitoring developments" of a health crisis that "poses evolving risks to economic activity."
With the rate cut, the Fed's main interest rate will be lowered to 1% to 1.25%. Although Powell and his colleagues can knock that down to zero or even into negative territory -- which Trump has suggested the Fed do -- analysts say lower interest rates by themselves are unlikely to be very effective.
For one thing, it's not a lack of credit or even cash that is of concern. Many corporations are flush. Rather, the problem is the threat of widespread closings of businesses and consumers staying at home because of travel restrictions or just being afraid to go to malls and public places.
Powell began the news conference Tuesday by stating that the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong, with unemployment very low and job growth solid. He also noted, however, that "we are beginning to see effects on the tourism and travel industries." And some latest measures of domestic manufacturing and consumer confidence already indicate weakening.
"The biggest concern for me is if there was a substantial drop in consumer spending, which has been the bedrock of the economic expansion," said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at Economic Outlook Group.
At this juncture, Baumohl doesn't see the outbreak triggering a recession in the U.S., but no one can say anything very confidently about the outlook.
Atsi Sheth, a managing director at Moody's, welcomed the Fed action and the pledges by others to do whatever it takes to shore up the economy. But ultimately, she said, it's a medical issue.
"Until the virus itself and the fear of the virus is contained, I think you're going to see markets and the real economy suffer," Sheth said.
Powell acknowledged as much, saying that "we do recognize a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection [and] won't fix broken supply chains."
Yet he said lower rates should boost consumer and business confidence, and support conditions affecting credit markets and the financial system.
As he has often, Powell insisted the Fed would make decisions without regard to political considerations, responding indirectly to Trump's repeated harangues for the Fed to do more. Powell declined to say what fiscal policies should be taken but agreed that a multifaceted response was needed in the face of the epidemic.
The Trump administration itself is said to be considering a proposal for a temporary payroll tax cut, something that was a part of the stimulus to combat the Great Recession.
Analysts said that a payroll tax holiday could be effective if consumers should pull back or the economy starts to shed jobs. Job growth has been resilient during the last nearly 11 years of U.S. economic expansion, the longest on record. Other measures that the administration could take include extending jobless benefits and providing aid to states.
The current fractious political climate in an election year could make it difficult for new fiscal policy actions, however.
"The good news is that divided government will make it harder for the president and Congress to enact unneeded stimulus, just trying to get a boost in the economy today just to get to the election," said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president for policy at the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
"The flip side is it may make it harder to pass a needed stimulus," he said, although Goldwein expressed confidence that there was increasing bipartisan consensus to act if the economy goes into a downturn.
Congressional leaders are working toward a bipartisan deal on as much as $8 billion in emergency coronavirus spending.
The House and Senate are expected to quickly approve the legislation, which includes funding for the Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. It also includes money to help develop a vaccine, for protective and medical equipment, as well as aid to state and local governments that have contended with the virus.
"We're on the way to getting that through the House this week and with cooperation could get it through the Senate as well," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters after Vice President Mike Pence spoke behind closed doors with senators of both parties Tuesday.
The amount Congress is expected to approve is multiple times more than what the administration initially asked for, although still less than what some health policy experts have said was needed. Democrats have accused Trump of not moving quickly enough to respond to the spread of the virus.
"The most important thing we can do right now is pass a strong emergency supplemental as quickly as possible, so that our federal and state and local health officials have all of the resources they need. This is truly a serious crisis, and we cannot respond on the cheap or at the last minute," said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), whose state has had nine coronavirus deaths.
For the Fed, the last time it made an emergency rate cut was in late 2008 during the global financial crisis.
The U.S. economy in many ways is stronger to deal with a downturn today. There's no housing market bubble, and consumers, banks and businesses are not nearly as leveraged and vulnerable to a slowdown.
But as Moody's Sheth noted, because the Great Recession was financial and economic in nature, monetary and fiscal stimulus went a long way in supporting the economy.
The current crisis, she said, similarly involves global connections, of people, supply chains and financial markets.
"Those linkages are actually spreading both the virus and the fear, and the slowdown in economic activity," she said. "And it's not clear how you get immunity from it."

Stock market plunges despite Fed's emergency rate cut

U.S. stocks plummeted Tuesday after the Federal Reserve's emergency rate cut failed to bring calm, extending the mayhem that has defined the markets for days over growing concerns that the coronavirus will blunt economic growth.
The Dow Jones industrial average sank nearly 3 percent, 786 points, and the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond - a foundation of global finance - briefly fell below 1 percent, before recovering slightly, as investors fled equities for the safety of bonds. Investors are worried that the spreading outbreak will upend the global economy and end the decade-long expansion.
The Standard &Poor's 500 and Nasdaq composite closed off nearly 3 percent. All 11 S&P stock market sectors were in negative territory, with technology and financials faring the worst. Lower interest rates have an adverse effect on the profits of banks and financial services companies. All but one of the 30 Dow components finished the day in the red. American Express, 3M and Microsoft were the Dow's biggest losers. Only Coca-Cola stayed positive.
Stocks twisted and turned most of the day, despite the central bank announcing it would slash the benchmark U.S. interest rate by half a percentage point.
"The Fed went a little early," said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group. "Everybody knew the Fed was going to lower interest rates, but they left markets with a lot more questions than answers. That's why the early-morning bounce was quickly sold."
The Fed, whose leaders were unanimous in their decision to bring the rate to just below 1.25 percent, had not taken such an emergency step since 2008. The announcement came after the Group of Seven failed to offer a specific course to combat the economic fallout from the outbreak, which has upended global supply chains since the first cases emerged in Wuhan, China, in December.
At a hastily called news conference Tuesday morning, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said the central bank took action to help counter the economic risks that have emerged in recent weeks. He said that the Fed is in active discussions with other central banks and that any future changes to monetary policy would come based on the best information available at that time.
Yet his comments did little to settle markets.
"In times of crisis, the Federal Reserve should just let the policy decision stand on its own," Cox said. "It's too easy for those comments to be misconstrued."
The Fed has been under increasing pressure to take action to quell the anxiety that has roiled global markets for days and filtered down to consumers, who are clearing store shelves of water, disinfectant and shelf-stable food in anticipation of quarantines and shortages. But interest rates were already at low levels, and economists worry that any further reductions will give the central bank less leeway in the event of a recession.
"The Fed's rate cut is a psychological palliative, but I have severe doubts it will make a difference to economic growth going forward," said Daniel Wiener, chairman of Adviser Investments.
The 10-year Treasury yield's record low beneath 1 percent also rattled markets.
"Two things are driving the 10-year bond yield lower," said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. "First is the Federal Reserve decision to reduce interest rates. Also is the growing concerns about future economic growth and inflation, which are sharply lower the past week because of the coronavirus."
Dropping bond yields, which decrease as bond prices increase, "means the U.S. Treasury is the safe haven of choice for investors concerned about economic growth and equities," Tilley said. 
The whirlwind day came just after Wall Street staged an explosive rally, shaking off its worst week since the financial crisis. The Dow surged nearly 1,300 points, closing up 5.1 percent, its largest percentage gain since March 2009. And the three major indexes all exited correction territory, which marks a 10 percent reversal from recent highs. 
Yet at the close of the markets Tuesday, all three indexes were back in correction territory.
The coronavirus has caused a rupture in global supply chains, particularly for goods manufactured and produced in China, where economic activity has largely stalled. And the longer fears follow the spread of the coronavirus, the shakier consumer confidence could be, as Americans rein in their spending. The world economy is now expected to have its worst year of growth since 2009, according to forecasts. 
"Stocks are likely to continue reacting to ebbs and flows in the news cycle, and it is too early to tell if Monday's 1,300-point rally in the Dow means a bottom is in place for stocks," said David L. Bahnsen, chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, based in Newport Beach, Calif., with over $2.25 billion in assets under management. "Economic damage has certainly been done, but how severe and for how long remains to be seen."

The country's biggest banks are asking federal officials for long-sought regulatory relief as part of the government's efforts to contain the economic fallout from the new coronavirus, requests that experts lambasted as opportunistic and unnecessary.
The Bank Policy Institute - a lobbying group for big banks including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup - is recommending that the Federal Reserve take steps including lowering capital requirements and easing the periodic "stress tests" that banks undergo to prove they can survive another economic crisis.
The Federal Reserve could "make changes to its bank regulations or enact promptly already planned regulatory changes that would not reduce safety, soundness or financial stability," the group said in a note titled "Actions the Fed Could Take in Response to COVID-19" and signed by Greg Baer, its chief executive; Francisco Covas, its head of research; and Bill Nelson, the chief economist.
The recommendations are "transparently opportunistic," said Jeremy Kress, an assistant law professor at the University of Michigan School of Business. For years, the banking industry resisted calls for higher capital requirements that could have been used as a buffer, or a rainy-day fund, during economic turmoil, he said. Those buffers could have been turned off now to give the industry more flexibility to make loans during the current economic uncertainty, Kress said.
But without those buffers reducing existing capital requirements, which are currently set at minimum levels, the timing could be risky, he said.
"The whole idea of capital requirements and stress-testing banks is to make sure they have enough cushion to absorb losses" during an economic crisis, Kress said.
Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio), the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement: "My priority right now is ensuring that our federal, state and local health agencies have the resources they need to keep Americans safe. It's not the time to reduce financial system protections to bolster the bottom lines for Wall Street."
Several of the group's largest members, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup, declined to comment on the BPI's efforts. 
JPMorgan Chase, the country's largest bank, is "ready to help" with the government's coronavirus response, spokesman Andrew Gray said in a statement. "Our primary focus as a bank is to consistently provide credit and capital to support clients, customers and communities through this uncertain period," he said. 
The Fed made an emergency interest rate cut Tuesday, slashing the benchmark U.S. interest rate by half a percentage point, but has made no mention of the industry's desired regulatory relief. "We saw a risk to the outlook of the economy, and we chose to act," Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said at a news conference shortly after the rate-cut announcement.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters after a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday that he is talking to bank regulators about potential regulatory relief measures.
The staff of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of high-level regulators, is also scheduled to discuss the novel coronavirus during a meeting this week, according to a person familiar with the planning but not authorized to speak publicly.
Wall Street has scrambled to respond to the spread of the virus, which now has a global death toll of more than 3,000. 
At the bank's annual meeting last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said he dreamed about the coronavirus. "I had this nightmare that somehow in Davos, all of us who went there got it, and then we all left and spread it," he said, according to CNN. "The only good news from that is that it might have just killed the elite."
In its note, the Bank Policy Institute says it supports "easing monetary policy" but goes on to recommend some long-sought regulatory changes. "All of these reforms are designed to allow banks to deploy their abundant capital and liquidity to continue lending in support of the economy," Baer, the group's president, said in a statement. "We have been proposing many of these reforms for years with a moment like this in mind; it would be strange to abandon them when they were potentially most needed."
The banking industry has scored significant wins rolling back regulations under the Trump administration. Federal regulators this year proposed weakening key post-financial-crisis restrictions, known as the Volcker rule, on risky trading. It has also proposed allowing big banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America to submit their full "living wills" - plans for their closure during another economic crisis - less often.
Deregulation has already gone too far, and the novel coronavirus could pose unique challenges to the financial system that are still unclear, said Larry White, a professor at New York University Stern School of Business. As the virus spreads, some people may not be able to work, shop and travel, he said, and "that is a problem for businesses because at the end of the day, they won't be able to sell stuff."
"But I am not sure that is a good argument for, 'Oh, we need to do something about liquidity.' That is overreach by BPI," White said.

With its emergency interest rate cut of half a percent, the Federal Reserve tried once again riding to the rescue of investors who have come to expect that they will be shielded from the consequences of their own speculative excess. 
The Fed and other central bankers would have you believe that their only mission is to prevent the global economy from falling into a nasty and unnecessary recession as the spread of the coronavirus disrupts supply chains and travel and forces offices and factories to suspend operations. But as many others have correctly noted, lowering interest rates does nothing to inoculate the economy from such a supply-side shock or the recession that may ensue. In the face of a pandemic, cheaper money is unlikely to cause business or household to borrow, spend or invest. 
Rather, their purpose was more psychological: to halt the stampede of investors out of stocks and risky loans and into safer government bonds. It was the plentiful, cheap money supplied by central bankers that encouraged the herd to pile into those frothy markets in recent years, seemingly oblivious to the possibility of an economic downturn that might cut into profits or cause loans to go unpaid. Now that a downturn is upon us, central bankers and finance ministers feel they have no choice but to promise investors yet another tranche of cheap money. The clear message from the Fed: "We've got your back." 
The Fed's rate cut, in fact, had already been anticipated by the markets beginning Friday afternoon with Chair Jerome H. Powell's statement vowing to use all available tools to support the economy, and then continuing with Monday's rally which saw stock prices soar by more than 5 percent. The volatile trading that followed the Fed's announcement on Tuesday was not so much a sign of disappointment with what the Fed had done as recognition that the economic risks posed by the pandemic were likely to get worse before they get better. At one point, the Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 900 points from Monday's close before ending the day down 785 points, or nearly 3 percent. 
From the perspective of financial markets, the Fed's most immediate concern has been the surge of capital flowing out of countries that are most susceptible to the pandemic, and into government bonds of countries like the United States and Germany. The effect has been to dramatically increase interest rates in the more vulnerable countries while pushing rates down to record lows in the havens, in the process roiling markets in both places. On Tuesday, the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds fell below 1 percent for the first time ever, while in Germany the yield on the 10-year Bund remains in negative territory. The plunge in long-term rates has put pressure on the Fed and other central bankers to lower the shorter-term lending rates, which they more directly control.
Going forward, the Fed should also consider selling some of its swollen inventory of the longer term into a market that can't seem to get enough of them, even as they push down short-term rates. the Fed and other central banks spent trillions of dollars buying up longer-term bonds to stabilize the economy in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, as part of a novel strategy known as "quantitative easing." Selling those bonds now could put a floor under longer-term rates even as it pushes short-term rates down even further, alleviating some of the distortion that has crept into the bond market in recent weeks. 
Longer term, the bigger concern is that a full-blown recession could trigger a cascade of loan defaults by businesses that are carrying more debt than they did before the financial crash of 2008. 
Last week saw record outflows from mutual funds and exchange-traded funds specializing in risky "junk" bonds and business loans. The difference in yields between risky and safe instruments increased more than a full percentage point - the equivalent of a tidal wave in the staid world of bond markets. Given the turmoil, issuance of new bonds and business loans in that part of the credit market also came to a grinding halt. 
Many of the investors who buy, package and trade these securities - or issue derivative instruments designed to insure them - do so with lots of borrowed money. And should the pandemic worsen and the sell-off resume, those investors and traders would face demand from their lenders seeking immediate repayment. As we saw during the 2008 crash, forced selling quickly spreads to other asset classes as investors sell whatever they can to raise cash. As prices fall, panic selling begets more panic selling, and more margin calls, creating a downdraft that pulls down the price of all but the safest investments. 
"Exogenous shocks often expose bad leverage," one Bank of America analyst warned his investment clients last week. Or as Warren Buffett is fond of saying, it is only when the economic tide goes out that you discover who's been swimming naked.
Of particular concern are smaller oil and gas drilling companies that took on billions of dollars in debt in recent years to cash in on higher energy prices and fracking. Now, with the prospect of a global slowdown driving oil prices down below $50 a barrel, many of those companies have halted drilling and face the prospect of defaulting on those loans. Last week saw a sell-off of their debt. 
There are similar concerns about retail companies, many of which were bought up by private equity firms that paid for the purchase by loading the companies up with debt. They, too, are likely to feel the effect of a recession and the pullback in consumer spending. Indeed, even before the threat of the coronavirus emerged, bonds issued by Macy's were downgraded by the rating agencies, and now trade as junk. 
Indeed, looking across all industries at the end of 2019, Standard &Poor's calculated that three corporate borrowers suffered credit rating downgrades in the final quarter of 2019 for every one that won an upgrade - the worst ratio since 2015 and a similar reading to just before the 2008 crash. The amount of lower-rate corporate debt now outstanding is the highest it has ever been. The lower the rating, the higher the risk that lenders and investors will not be repaid. 
In a prolonged economic or market downturn, even companies that are able to service their loans could face the additional risk that they will be able to roll them over - that is, to get a new loan to pay off the old one, as is common practice. Tens of billions of dollars in risky business loans are set to come due this year, with the volume rising sharply in 2022.
Mindful of these credit market risks, and the risks they pose to the broader economy, the Federal Reserve recently told Wall Street banks that, as part of their annual "stress tests," they must prove that they have enough capital and risk management capability to withstand a wave of corporate defaults and outflows from loan funds that cause the price of credit instruments to fall. Given the complex ways in which these loans are packaged and repackaged and sold off as securities, regulators don't really know who holds the ultimate risk associated with these credit instruments. That could include not only the investors and funds that hold them, but the banks that lend money to buy them, along with the investment banks and hedge funds that effectively insure them. And as we learned in 2008, when markets are that complex and opaque, when the market turns, panicked investors and lenders tend to sell off everything when they can't really tell the good risks from the bad ones. 
Given year after year of record levels of lending to highly indebted companies, it's hardly surprising that the Fed wants banks to calculate their exposure during a serious downturn or market rout. What's surprising is that the Fed waited so long and now finds itself without the information when it really needs it.

EMERGENCY ACTION SHARPEST SINCE '08
Stocks plunge again as recession worries mount 
The Federal Reserve on Tuesday took the emergency step of cutting the benchmark U.S. interest rate by half a percentage point, an attempt to limit the economic and financial fallout from the coronavirus.
The U.S. central bank has not made a cut like this since late 2008, shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Fed leaders believed it was wise to move quickly as concerns grow about the plunging stock market and a severe disruption in every major economy. Recession fears in the United States have spiked in recent days.
"We saw a risk to the outlook for the economy and chose to act," Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said at a news conference shortly after the rate-cut announcement.
The cut led to a stock market rally, but it was short-lived.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down 786 points, or nearly 3 percent, and the bond market flashed a warning sign as the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond fell briefly below 1 percent for the first time ever.
The concerns have picked up in velocity. Many U.S. companies initially scrambled to reroute manufacturing supply chains because their China suppliers were shuttered.
But a broader worry has now emerged, as many U.S. businesses are prohibiting work-related travel, fearful of health risks. And there's a fear that consumers will pull back on their own expenditures as the virus spreads, schools are shut down and the stock market swings. This kind of sharp pullback could derail what had been steady economic growth, leading companies to cut workers and investments, and creating a drag that is hard to arrest.
The Fed's action reduced the U.S. interest rate to just below 1.25 percent, down from about 1.75 percent. Fed leaders voted unanimously in favor of the rate reduction. Powell tried to project a sense of calm during 13-minute news conference and repeatedly said that U.S. economic fundamentals still looked healthy. But he noted that "sentiment" had shifted. Some investors say the Fed's extraordinary action raised alarms that things had deteriorated faster than expected.
Experts have warned that the coronavirus is suddenly shaping up to be the biggest risk to the global economy since the financial crisis. Growth this year is expected to slow sharply, even if a recession is avoided. Goldman Sachs has projected that growth in the United States could stall in the second quarter, which runs from April through June.
The Fed's move is one of several that policymakers have discussed in recent weeks. Congress is preparing a $7.5 billion emergency funding package to help with the costs of fighting the epidemic. President Trump on Tuesday called for new tax cuts and an even bigger Fed rate cut to stimulate the economy. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, meanwhile, said the administration would consider an infrastructure package and regulatory relief for banks, but discussions appeared to be in early stages.
He criticized the Fed for not doing more Tuesday, but there are limits to what the central bank can achieve, especially with interest rates already low. Also, the coronavirus is causing many people to stay home, regardless of how available cheap credit is.
"You are not going to slay a disease by lowering interest rates," said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. He compared to the Fed's cut to "placing a Band-Aid on an arm to cure a headache."
Powell acknowledged that the Fed cannot come up with a vaccine or fix a broken supply chain that has been disrupted by the outbreak in China, but he believes the rate cut will help protect against a rapid downturn.
"We don't think we have all the answers, but we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy," Powell said. "It will support accommodative financial conditions and avoid a tightening of financial conditions, which can weigh on activity. And it will help boost household and business confidence."
While some worry that Powell caved to Trump, many economists and investors thought the Fed chair made a mistake by not using Tuesday's news conference to stress that the Fed would act again if needed.
"The Fed's action today is better than nothing, but it's not quite what the doctor ordered," said George Selgin, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and a close Fed watcher. "Powell needed to give markets a more certain sense of the Fed's willingness to move rates further as necessary."
Powell left the door open to another rate cut, but he stopped far short of promising action. He once again dismissed the idea that the Fed is caving to Trump's wishes. 
"We're never going to consider any political considerations whatsoever. We will not do that. And it's very important for people to understand," Powell said.
Many economists blame the White House and Congress for being slow to respond to the crisis, thereby forcing the Fed to step in with its blunt instruments.
"We need to know the extent of the virus in the U.S. We are not even doing broad-based testing. We don't know where this is or who has it. The uncertainty is so high right now about the most basic things, and that's weighing on the economy," said Julia Coronado, a former Fed staffer and founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives.
In contrast to Trump, Mnuchin praised the Fed's action Tuesday, telling Congress, "They did the right thing getting ahead of this. . . . I applaud the Fed on this move."
Earlier Tuesday morning, global finance ministers held a call to discuss the economic unrest, but they stopped short of announcing any joint steps. During the 2008 financial crisis, finance ministers from the Group of 7 industrial nations announced "urgent and exceptional action" to bail out the banks. Shortly after the Tuesday call, however, the Fed made its announcement.
The Fed's move followed Australia's central bank, which cut interest rates to their lowest level ever. Trump had demanded the Fed follow suit.
"Australia's Central Bank cut interest rates and state it will most likely further ease in order to make up for China's coronavirus situation and slowdown. They reduced to 0.5%, a record low. Other countries are doing the same thing, if not more so. Our Federal Reserve has us paying higher rates than many others, when we should be paying less," Trump tweeted. The Fed "should ease and cut rate big."
Lowering interest rates makes it even cheaper to borrow money, but it does not address the root cause of the current concern in financial markets.
In addition to Fed rate cuts, Trump called for a one-year reduction in payroll taxes, which would be an immediate boost to the paychecks of working Americans if approved by Congress. Payroll taxes are used to fund Social Security and Medicare and have been reduced in past times of economic trouble, including after the financial crisis.
While Democrats have been highly critical of the 2017 GOP tax cuts, some Democratic lawmakers might be open to payroll tax cuts. About 75 percent of U.S. taxpayers get assessed the payroll tax, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Americans pay payroll taxes on income up to $137,700, so a cut would not have an impact on any income above that level.
Still, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) dismissed Trump's call for a payroll tax cut when asked about it Tuesday. "I don't think tax cuts are the answer to every problem," Hoyer said.
However, he left the door open to some sort of fiscal stimulus in the future if the economy falls deeper into peril because of the virus's spread.
"That may or may not be what we would do," he said of a potential stimulus, saying Congress would remain "focused on . . . trying to keep the economy stable and growing and keep people employed.

Crude Prices Pare Gains After Fed Cuts Rates; Investors wait to see whether OPEC, allies will agree to cut output further

U.S. crude prices pared most of their earlier gains Tuesday after the Federal Reserve's interest-rate cut failed to allay investors' concerns about an economic fallout from the coronavirus epidemic.
Last week, West Texas Intermediate futures logged their biggest one-week percentage drop since the financial crisis. They rose Monday and again Tuesday after the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate by a half percentage point in a bid to mitigate the virus's hit on the economy.
But by the end of the day, they had trimmed most of their intraday gains. Brent, the global gauge of prices, pared all of its advance from earlier in the day.
U.S. crude prices ended the day up 0.9% at $47.18 a barrel, while Brent edged down less than 0.1% and settled at $51.86 a barrel.
Although the Fed's move could soften potential economic disruptions due to the virus, which could help prop up oil demand, analysts had cautioned investors to expect continued volatility in crude prices.
"While lower rates would marginally reduce costs of carrying oil inventory, this factor is modest in relation to the dramatic cut in petroleum demand that is currently being seen around the world," analysts at Ritterbusch &Associates wrote in a Tuesday note.
The Fed's move followed an announcement by finance ministers and central-bank governors from Group of Seven countries that they were ready to take steps to contain the economic fallout of the coronavirus epidemic.
Investors are also waiting to see whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will agree on further production cuts during this week's OPEC+ meeting. Saudi Arabia has been trying to persuade Russia to agree to deeper output curbs.
Elsewhere in commodities, front-month gold futures rose 3.1% to $1,642.10 a troy ounce, their largest one-day percentage increase since June. Lower rates tend to boost gold, which struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets when rates rise as the metal offers no yield for simply holding it.

Just ahead of an emergency Federal Reserve rate cut, big banks' demand for Fed temporary liquidity shot higher and exceeded what the central bank was willing to provide on Tuesday, as financial markets remained deeply unsettled amid big worries about the coronavirus situation's impact on the global economy.
But even as the Fed added substantial amounts of money to the market via two repurchase-agreement operations, or repos, its lever to affect the performance of the economy and the focus of its monetary-policy actions, the federal-funds rate, stood at an effective 1.59% on Monday, well within the official range 1.50% and 1.75% that prevailed on Monday.
The Fed lowered its target rate range by half a percentage point, to 1.00% and 1.25%. It said "the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity." All members of the FOMC were on board with the easing.
The New York Fed's two repo operations were significantly larger than recent interventions. Its overnight operation saw eligible banks take the $100 billion limit from the Fed even as they'd sought $108.61 billion in central-bank cash. The Fed's 14-day repo operation injected $20 billion into the financial system, even as banks—called primary dealers—wanted $70.95 billion from the Fed.
With $78.14 billion in repos expiring today, the overall pool of temporary money the central bank is adding to the financial system rose by $41.9 billion to $195 billion, the highest level since late January. That compares with the $255.62 billion in repos that were outstanding on Jan. 1.
The large-scale Fed repos arrived as financial markets had been moving to expect aggressive Fed rate cuts to help protect the economy against trouble from the coronavirus situation. Investors' anxiety has driven big stock-market declines and driven Treasury yields, the beneficiary of flight-to-safety borrowing, to historically low levels.
Large Fed operations could persist given the market's anxiety level.
"We are in for lots of volatility all month," said Scott Skyrm, executive vice president in fixed income and repo at Curvature Securities. The big Treasury market rally, driven by concern over the coronavirus, is generating some scarcity in Treasurys in the repo market, where banks borrow and lend bonds and cash short term.
Thomas Simons, economist at investment bank Jefferies, said he didn't view the big repo demand as necessarily indicative of a bigger problem in the market. But he noted that in addition to banks trying to position for a Fed rate cut, there were also pressures relating to the settlement of around $56 billion in Treasury debt, "so there's a little bit of added pressure on the market from the natural supply/demand for funding that typically happens around settlements during this period of heightened uncertainty."
When the Fed does a repo transaction, it takes in U.S. Treasury, agency and mortgage bonds from eligible banks in a de facto short-term loan of central-bank cash, collateralized by the bonds. Primary dealers are limited in the amount of liquidity they can take in exchange for their securities, and they pay interest to the central bank to get the funds.
Fed money-market interventions are aimed at keeping the fed-funds rate within the central bank's target range. The Fed controls the fed-funds rate to influence the overall cost of borrowing in the U.S. economy as part of its efforts to achieve the job and inflation goals set for it by Congress.
The Fed has been adding significant amounts of temporary liquidity to financial markets since September. Then, after a decadelong break, it restarted its repo operations amid unexpected volatility in short-term rate markets.
The Fed has been working to build up reserve levels in the banking system to ensure short-term-rate volatility is contained. It currently plans to wind down repo operations in April and end its Treasury bill purchases at some point in the second quarter. But the rapidly shifting outlook for markets and monetary policy has cast uncertainty on that plan.

Companies Find Ways to Keep Their Annual Reports From Being a Bore; Videos, graphics and other elements can provide information in ways that engage and go beyond what regulators request

When German chemicals maker Covestro AG began drafting its 2019 annual report in August, executives opted for a change. Instead of producing a text-heavy report, the company decided to publish a digital version with video messages, interactive graphics and even a quiz.
It wasn't just the format of the annual report that changed—the purpose did too. Covestro turned what many companies view simply as a regulatory requirement into a resource for a broader audience to learn more about the company. "Behind our figures are emotional stories that we want to tell, regardless of time, place and device," said Thomas Toepfer, the company's finance chief.
For many companies, annual reports are no longer simply tomes of legalese, tables and footnotes. Executives increasingly are producing year-end summaries that allow for more reader engagement and easier consumption on mobile devices and computer screens.
Annual reports for 2019 from FTSE 100 companies provided better explanations of their business, potential threats to their operations and how they created value for stakeholders compared with previous years, according to research released in January by U.K. consulting firm Radley Yeldar Ltd.
"The trend in corporate reporting is toward providing a more complete picture of a company's business model, performance and prospects," said Lisa French, chief technical officer at the International Integrated Reporting Council, a coalition of regulators, standard setters, investors, companies and other groups that focuses on corporate reporting.
Reporting on the Coronavirus
In addition to formulating new-look annual reports, companies are puzzling over a more immediate reporting concern: what to tell investors about how the still-developing global coronavirus epidemic could affect future performance . The outbreak has coincided with deadlines for filing annual reports due in March.
The evolution, which has been more pronounced in Europe than in other parts of the world, has been driven in part by changing regulation. The European Union, for example, enacted a nonfinancial reporting directive forcing large listed companies to report on social and environmental issues. The shift also stems from greater investor demand for granular details presented in a way that is easy to digest.
British Land Co., for instance, has sought to produce a more readable annual report by eliminating jargon while still giving stakeholders information for a comprehensive understanding of the company.
"We operate in an industry which can be very technical and has been prone to using technical industry language and lots of three-letter acronyms," said David Walker, head of investor relations at British Land, one of the U.K.'s biggest property real-estate investment trusts.
In 2019, Mr. Walker and a team of about 10 spent half a year drafting, writing and revising the report, striving to use straightforward language while avoiding abbreviations such as ERV, short for estimated rental value. "We asked ourselves, 'Is everybody familiar with ERV?' Maybe not," he said. British Land now talks about "future rents" to make things easier for readers.
In the U.S., strict reporting requirements mean that public companies tend to stick to a more formal, text-heavy approach, lawyers and executives say. Companies reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission whose shareholders vote on the appointment of directors remain required to put out a printed version of the Form 10-K annual report and send it to shareholders in the mail.
U.S.-listed companies also have steadily increased the number of words used in footnotes to better explain financials, according to Audit Analytics, a research firm that analyzes financial filings. The average number of words in footnotes per 10-K was 22,905 in 2019, up from 18,821 in 2014, Audit Analytics said.
"There is little variance in Form 10-Ks filed by U.S. companies, and there hasn't been a lot of innovation," said Anna Pinedo, a securities lawyer at law firm Mayer Brown LLP in New York.
"U.S. companies could deviate a bit more from the formula, but that may make them [prone] to litigation."
The SEC recently proposed changes to rules governing how companies disclose financial information, shifting from strict guidance toward principles-based disclosures that aim to simplify information for companies and investors.
Some U.S. companies have found ways to satisfy regulators while providing additional, nonfinancial information for investors. E-commerce marketplace Etsy Inc. last year integrated metrics about the wider environmental and societal impact of its business in its annual report. "It is a pretty coordinated storytelling exercise," said Rachel Glaser, Etsy's finance chief.
Vornado Realty Trust filed its audited sustainability report to the SEC, even though it isn't a regulatory requirement. "We expect more companies to follow the example," said Joseph Macnow, the company's finance chief. The fact that the SEC doesn't prescribe a certain format for companies' reporting on sustainability gives Vornado more flexibility to go beyond the numbers, he said.
That approach is welcomed by investors who want to dig deeper into a company.
"Every [material piece of] information, on top of what's required from a regulatory perspective, is useful for me as an investor," said Robert-Jan Boudewijn, a portfolio manager at APG Groep NV, a Dutch pension fund management firm.
The annual report overhaul at Covestro appears to have led to more engagement with investors, Mr. Toepfer said. Page views were up, the number of comments rose and the company got more mentions in social networks, he said.
The cherry on top: Covestro saved some money—around €30,000 ($33,411)—by switching to a digital report, Mr. Toepfer said. The company only printed 200 annual reports, down from several thousand in years prior.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded from a seven-session streak of declines with its best day in more than a decade, lifted by investors' bets that central banks can stabilize markets and shield economic growth from the impact of the coronavirus epidemic.
Monday's moves helped reverse some of the declines suffered last week -- the worst for major U.S. indexes since the financial crisis. Gains were broad-based, with all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 rising more than 2%. Apple and Microsoft surged, adding a combined $193 billion in market value for the day, according to FactSet data. U.S. oil prices posted their largest one-session advance since mid-September.
The blue-chip index of 30 stocks surged 1,293.96 points, or 5.1%, to 26703.32 in its biggest one-day percentage gain since March 2009 and its biggest point advance on record. Other major indexes posted their biggest one-day percentage gains since December 2018, with the S&P 500 rising 136.01 points, or 4.6%, to 3090.23 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gaining 384.80 points, or 4.5%, to 8952.16.
Investors piled into wagers that the Federal Reserve and other major central banks may lower interest rates, possibly in tandem to boost the firepower of stimulus efforts. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note plumbed new lows, settling at 1.085%, according to Tradeweb.
The gains came after U.S. stocks notched their worst week since the financial crisis, buffeted by worries the spreading coronavirus will slow growth. Between late Friday and Monday, the Dow industrials climbed 8.2% from Friday's intraday low in furious and sometimes erratic trading.
Since Sunday, there have been market-moving statements from central banks, the World Health Organization, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
The rapid reversals sparked by reactions to all those headlines show a market under the sway of "human emotions" as much as anything else, said Instinet Executive Director Frank Cappelleri.
"It changes by the hour," Mr. Cappelleri said.
A volatile session began when stocks in Asia surged overnight after the Bank of Japan joined the Federal Reserve in pledging to take action in response to the coronavirus epidemic.
That prompted Japan's Nikkei 225 index to reverse early losses and close almost 1% higher. China's Shanghai Composite surged 3.2%, even after official purchasing managers' indexes in China, released over the weekend, plunged to records. These PMI gauges cover factories and many other parts of the economy, including services and construction.
Early Tuesday in Asia, the Nikkei was flat, the Shanghai Composite was up 1.7%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.6% and South Korea's Kospi was up 1.4%.
Echoing the BOJ and Federal Reserve, a senior official at the European Central Bank later said the ECB could take its interest rates further into negative territory and begin new bond purchases to support the eurozone economy. The Stoxx Europe 600 swung several times before ending the session up 0.1%.
In Australia, the central bank on Tuesday became the first developed-market central bank to cut interest rates in response to the coronavirus, reducing its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage point to a record 0.5%. At 3 p.m. Tuesday in Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 benchmark was up 1.4%.
In the U.S. Monday, tech stocks and banks rallied. Apple surged 9.3% to $298.81, Visa gained 5.8% to $192.33 and Microsoft added 6.7% to $172.79. The S&P 500 financial sector posted its biggest one-day gain since November 2011. Citigroup rose 6.5% to $67.59, and JPMorgan Chase climbed 4.7% to $121.52.
Fears about the fallout from the virus haven't dissipated. Monday's gains were led by utilities, consumer staples and real-estate stocks, all sectors investors tend to buy when they are nervous. Costco Wholesale Corp. climbed 10% to $309.14 and Walmart rose 7.6% to $115.88, with investors expecting both retailers to receive a boost from shoppers stocking up.
Some of the stocks most closely tied to fears about the epidemic's effects were still down. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings fell 4.5% to $35.59, Carnival lost 1.2% to $33.06. American Airlines dropped 1% to $18.86 and United Airlines slipped 0.5% to $61.26.

Mexican Market Suffers Less Amid Global Pain

As coronavirus fears roil financial markets, some investors are betting Mexican stocks could eventually stand to benefit.
Their argument: Global supply chain disruption might lead some U.S. companies to relocate operations to Mexico from Asia. An added boost could come from adoption of a new free-trade agreement between the U.S. and Mexico.
Mexico was "getting a boost from the trade tensions with China and now with the coronavirus, it gets more of an acceleration," said Sanjiv Bhatia, chief investment officer at Pembroke Emerging Markets.
That isn't to say Mexico is immune from fears of slowing global growth triggered by the spread of the coronavirus. Mexico also on Friday confirmed its first case of a person infected with the virus.
But upbeat long-term expectations could help explain why Mexican stocks fared better than some others during last week's market tumult. The country's benchmark IPC Composite index ended the week down around 5% year-to-date. That compares with a 9.3% year-to-date decline for MSCI's Latin America-wide measure and a nearly 9% drop for the S&P 500.
Mexico's performance contrasts with Latin America's other major equity markets such as Chile and Brazil, which have largely been falling since mid-January. The sharp decline in commodity prices due to falling Chinese demand has weighed on their export-driven economies. Chile is off more than 10% year-to-date and Brazil is down around 11%.
While Mexico is also an oil exporter, its economy is more diversified and its strong links to global trade could be a boon as well, according to William Praett, manager of Fidelity's Latin America Fund. "From a longer-term perspective, the cost competitiveness of Mexico for manufacturing activities relative to Asia has improved a lot," he said.
Trade links will grow even stronger once the new trade deal is passed to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta.
Mexican equities rallied 3.2% in the three trading days after the Senate vote.

U.S. News: Meat Piles Up as Epidemic Dents Exports

The coronavirus epidemic is exacerbating a meat glut in the U.S., filling cold-storage facilities with pork, chicken and beef intended for export to markets hit by the outbreak.
Rising quantities of breasts, thigh meat and drumsticks lifted the amount of chicken in U.S. cold storage facilities by 12% over the first month of the year to 957.5 million pounds, the highest level on record for the month of January, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The amount of pork in storage climbed 11% versus January 2019. Meat industry executives say those stockpiles have likely since grown.
"The cold storages we deal with are all busting at the seams," Joe Sanderson, chief executive of Mississippi-based chicken company Sanderson Farms Inc., said on a conference call last week.
U.S. meatpackers including Sanderson, Tyson Foods Inc. and Pilgrim's Pride Corp. have been counting on big orders from Chinese buyers, as trade tensions ease and China struggles to fill a pork shortfall after losing hundreds of millions of hogs to a swine disease. U.S. meat exports to China surged in late 2019, with more U.S. pork shipped to the country in November and December than in all of 2018, according to the USDA.
The coronavirus has scrambled that outlook. People staying home rather than eating out slowed meat consumption in China, which hurt orders from the U.S., and government-mandated quarantines in China created logistical snarls.
"The ports are basically backed up," Tyson's CEO Noel White said at an investor event last month.
Four China-bound ships loaded with Sanderson chicken were diverted from their destinations in recent weeks, although eventually all of them landed, the company's executives said.
Cold storage warehouses serve as staging grounds where vast quantities of meat, along with french fries, seafood and other products, are held before delivery to domestic buyers or shipping ports. Meat can be kept frozen in cold storage warehouses for months, at a cost to the companies that produced it.
Lineage Logistics Holding LLC's cold storage warehouses in shipping hubs like Los Angeles and Seattle are close to full, said Brian Beattie, senior vice president of sales. Pallets of shrink-wrapped boxed pork, chicken and beef are stacked on racks that rise nearly 60 feet to the ceiling.
Lineage is working with meat companies to store excess products in secondary sites in Oregon and Northern California, Mr. Beattie said. Workers in black-and-orange freezer suits work around the clock in zero-degree temperatures, packing away meat intended for China and other Asian markets.
NewCold, a cold-storage company operating warehouses in Washington and Idaho, has been fielding calls from meat companies, as well as vegetable and bread suppliers, all seeking available storage space, said business development head Jonas Swarttouw.
"There is so little slack in our cold storage industry that this little ripple immediately creates concerns," Mr. Swarttouw said.
Each week, processing plants slaughter millions of chickens and hundreds of thousands of hogs and cattle. Deliveries for that meat are scheduled months in advance. Meat companies need to continually turn over their inventory, which has a limited shelf life even when frozen.
"It's the sell it or smell it principle," said Christine McCracken, protein analyst for agricultural lender Rabobank.
Meat producers can't count on U.S. consumers to eat up the slack, said Altin Kalo, an economist with Steiner Consulting Group.
"We simply cannot absorb domestically all the protein," he said.

Betting markets show Hillary Clinton is one of the top contenders in the race for the Democratic nominee.
She isn't running for president.
Prediction markets have become a popular, though not necessarily reliable, way for people to bet on political results. While notoriously volatile and often proven wrong, betting markets are drawing extra scrutiny ahead of this week's Super Tuesday contests.
Consider PredictIt, an online market run by New Zealand's Victoria University of Wellington. Offering a range of election and other political bets, PredictIt currently shows a bettor can pay 7 cents to win $1 if Mrs. Clinton wins the Democratic nomination. Those are the fourth-best odds of any nominee, better than those of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
Perhaps the prediction markets know something others don't, but Mrs. Clinton isn't a candidate. (A PredictIt spokesman said Mrs. Clinton's odds were likely a reflection of "trader long-shot bias" and the possibility of a brokered convention, among other factors.)
Other metrics also show extremes that don't mesh with what more traditional political polls show. Bettors at one point on PredictIt last month gave former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg a 33% chance of winning the nomination.
Those odds -- which placed him in second place at the time and came on some of the heaviest volume PredictIt has logged over the past 90 days -- were also far higher than the probabilities he garnered in other political polls.
The 2020 campaign has largely been a secondary factor driving recent financial-market performance. Stocks are coming off their worst week since the financial crisis on fears of how the spreading coronavirus could crimp the global economy and profits.
Yet some investors also are trying to decipher what the Super Tuesday outcomes could mean for markets, particularly as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is a leading contender for the nomination.
Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, said the markets' recent swoon was driven by "rising Covid-19 fears, and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders' strong momentum."
Mixing politics and portfolios has historically had a mixed record. The conventional wisdom heading into the 2016 presidential election was a Donald Trump victory would prompt stocks to go down. Betting markets played down then-candidate Trump's chances. Of course, the opposite played out.
Goldman Sachs analysts said prediction markets suggest a divided federal government is the most probable election outcome, one that could lead to additional uncertainty if corporate tax reform implemented under President Trump is reversed. Under that scenario, Goldman said, "the impact on S&P 500 profits would be significant."
The firm is no longer expecting U.S. companies to post any earnings growth in 2020. It expects exporters will register falling demand and companies will suffer from supply-chain disruptions as a result of the spreading coronavirus outbreak, which could pose widespread disruptions on people's everyday lives and business activity and imperil the U.S. economy's longest expansion on record.
"An economic slowdown caused by this virus certainly increases Bernie's chances," said Dave Lutz, managing director and head of ETF trading at JonesTrading.
The thinking is a struggling economy, or even a recession, could hurt Mr. Trump's odds at being re-elected, paving the way for whoever becomes the Democratic nominee. PredictIt shows Mr. Sanders has a greater than 50% chance of securing the nomination, but only a 31% chance of beating President Trump in the election.
One indicator Goldman Sachs analysts are watching is second-quarter gross domestic product growth. Historically, this has been one of the most important metrics to watch in gauging a sitting U.S. president's re-election probability.

The coronavirus is scary, but the epidemic is proving to be a scary good opportunity for some merchants on Amazon.com.
While the retailer says it has cracked down on fake cures for the illness, it has no control over the prices charged for everyday products that might or might not suddenly be in short supply in brick and mortar stores. According to price-tracking site CamelCamelCamel, for example, a two-pack of 8 fluid ounces of Purell hand-sanitizing gel was going for $7.85 last summer from Amazon but is now only available from third-party sellers. The lowest price on Monday afternoon was $114.97. A one-liter pump bottle had been around $14 but was listed on Amazon at $229. A pack of powder-free nitrile examination gloves tripled in price to $16.49.
The prices are more modest for those just looking for information, although value for money is another matter.
Take, for example, "Coronavirus: All Secrets about Coronavirus, Practial (sic) Advice to Protect your Family, Symptoms and Treatment." Published on Feb. 10 and available as a paperback for $7.99, it is the No. 1 bestseller in pediatric and neonatal nursing. The first-time author has many enthusiastic five-star reviews, allegedly from U.S. buyers. "Very suggest this book" and "I am extremely worth investigating this book."
Or perhaps not worth investigating.

Two individuals from a private Rhode Island high school who went on a school trip to Europe in mid-February tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the state health department said.
The two patients, both associated with the Saint Raphael Academy in Pawtucket, R.I., were described as a male in his 40s and a female teenager.
A third person on the trip, a woman in her 30s, has also been tested and is self-quarantined at home with mild symptoms.
"All three people went on the same trip to Italy," Nicole Alexander-Scott, director of the Rhode Island Department of Health, said in a statement late Sunday. "This is precisely why we are being so aggressive in identifying contacts, ensuring monitoring, and testing people who are symptomatic."
In a statement on its website, the school said it would be closed for the week "out of an abundance of caution," with students attending "virtual days."
All 38 people who went on the trip will be self-monitoring for symptoms at home for 14 days, with public-health supervision, state health officials said.
The man in his 40s had limited travel in Rhode Island since returning from Italy, the state health department said.
"It is important to note that this member of the community has not been at the Academy since returning from Europe, and none of his immediate family members are symptomatic at this time," principal Daniel Richard said in an email Sunday to school staff, students and community.
In the email, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Richard said the chaperones and students on the trip will be out of school until March 9.
Saint Raphael Academy didn't respond to a request for comment.
Health officials are working to find people who were in direct contact with any of these three individuals, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is tracking down passengers who were on the return flight to the U.S. with the group from Saint Raphael Academy.
The school defended its decision to take the trip to Italy.
"At the time of the trip, which took place on February 14-22, there were no cases of community-spread coronavirus in Italy and no CDC travel warning in effect," the school said in a statement.
The CDC Level 3 travel warning to avoid nonessential travel was issued on Feb. 28.

Casinos Are on Cool Streak --- Virus spurs drop in gambling revenue in Macau; fears spread to Las Vegas

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
The world's largest gambling hub just suffered its worst revenue drop on record. The bad luck could run for a while yet.
Gambling revenue in Macau fell 88% in February from a year earlier. That isn't exactly a surprise: The semiautonomous Chinese city had an unprecedented 15-day shutdown of casinos last month to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
Even though the casinos reopened more than a week ago, visits to Macau remain much lower than normal as travel restrictions remain in place. The hotel-occupancy rate remained below 12% at the end of February, according to Goldman Sachs.
The bad days will likely continue. Citi, for example, expects more than 50% drops in Macau's gambling revenue for the first two quarters, with growth coming back only in the final quarter. Apart from the problem of visa restrictions, many high rollers from mainland China may see their income hit by the business disruptions caused by the outbreak.
While casinos can reduce some of their costs during the current downturn, they may not be able to fully offset the revenue plunge. That means they will likely be just barely profitable this quarter, and some may even dip into red.
How long their pain will last depends not just on when the coronavirus subsides, but also on how strongly China stimulates its economy. Macau's VIP gambling revenue is highly sensitive to China's economic and liquidity situation. The high rollers -- mostly wealthy businessmen from mainland China -- may come back sooner than casual gamblers, provided their businesses recover from the hit. Many of them hold business visas, which are subject to fewer restrictions, while casual gamblers may be more cautious in their travel plans. That means companies like Wynn Macau, which are more reliant on VIP business, could see a quicker rebound than the average casino.
Meanwhile, the U.S. gambling companies with a presence in Macau face another risk at home, where the coronavirus seems to be spreading. Many conferences have been cancelled, while casinos will likely see fewer visitors, too.
Investors have started to price in that risk: American casino stocks have reversed earlier relative gains versus their Macau subsidiaries. Shares of MGM Resorts, for example, have lost 21% since the beginning of February, underperforming those of the company's 55% owned subsidiary MGM China, which has dropped 6% over the same period.
Spreading your bets geographically doesn't seem to offer much protection against a highly infectious epidemic.

World News: OECD Warns Epidemic Threatens Growth

Global economic growth will slow sharply this year as governments attempt to contain the coronavirus epidemic, although the scale of the setback is highly uncertain, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said.
In its "best case" scenario, the Paris-based research body on Monday said the global economy would grow by 2.4%, weaker than the 2.9% expansion projected before the viral outbreak. That lost growth is roughly equivalent to $400 billion. But it said much more severe slowdowns are possible.
Global growth slowed in 2019, and was particularly weak in the final three months of the year. Given that starting point, the OECD said it is possible the global output will fall during the first three months of this year, putting the economy at risk of recession.
However, the research body is forecasting a rebound in growth during 2021, assuming the outbreak is contained over the coming months. But that recovery wouldn't be immediate, and some lost output would never be recovered.
"It's not like it plunges and then it recovers quickly," said Laurence Boone, the OECD's chief economist.
To date, the outbreak has been most severe in China, and the government has responded with travel bans and quarantine requirements that have closed factories and left service providers without customers.
In its best-case scenario, the OECD forecasts that China's economy will grow 4.9% this year, down from its previous projection of 5.7%. However, it expects growth to rebound to 6.4% in 2021, having previously forecast an expansion of 5.5%.
Leaders of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund said Monday they are prepared to use tools including emergency financing to help countries address the coronavirus.
"We will use our available instruments to the fullest extent possible, including emergency financing, policy advice and technical assistance," they said.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass said international cooperation is essential to deal with the health and economic effects. Finance ministers for the Group of Seven advanced economies plan to hold a conference call Tuesday morning to discuss their response to the virus, a U.S. Treasury spokeswoman confirmed.
In the U.S., the factory sector remained narrowly in expansion territory in February, although concerns about the coronavirus and its impact on supply chains rattled manufacturers.
The Institute for Supply Management said Monday its manufacturing index fell to 50.1 in February from 50.9 in January. Readings above 50 indicate activity is expanding across the manufacturing sector, while those below 50 signal contraction.
"Tariffs have been overshadowed by the global coronavirus disruptions as the top issue on supply chain managers' agendas -- at 42% of general comments, up from 2.5% in January," said Tim Fiore, who oversees the ISM survey of factory purchasing and supply managers. "I don't think we've hit the peak of the impact."
A survey of businesses released Monday by data firm IHS Markit found that manufacturing activity in China experienced its steepest slump on record during February. The country's Purchasing Managers Index fell to 40.3 from 50.1 in January, its lowest level since April 2004. A reading below 50 points to a drop in activity.
China accounts for a little more than 16% of global economic output, so disruption in the world's second-largest economy is expected to have an impact on a number of other economies. The OECD said those with the closest links -- Japan, South Korea and Australia -- will suffer most from a drop in Chinese tourists, a fall in Chinese demand for commodities and other goods, and an interruption in the supply of Chinese-made parts that are needed to complete products made in other countries.
The OECD said that makers of computers, electronics, pharmaceuticals and transport equipment around the world are particularly reliant on Chinese parts.

BUSINESS BEAT; Twitter surges as investor pushes changes; The stock jumps 7.9% on mounting pressure on the company's CEO, who also leads payment firm Square.

Twitter Inc. shares rose Monday after Bloomberg reported that an activist investor has built a sizable stake in the social media company and is pushing for changes, including possibly replacing co-founder and Chief Executive Jack Dorsey.
The stock climbed 7.9% to $35.82 a share. It had gained only 3.6% this year through Friday before news of the activist investor emerged.
When Twitter executives met their activist investor agitators from Elliott Management Corp. for the first time last week, the man with the most to lose was absent. Dorsey didn't attend the Friday night summit in San Francisco, where his future was the main topic of conversation, according to people familiar with the matter.
Instead, Twitter's representatives included Chairman Omid Kordestani and lead director Patrick Pichette, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details weren't public. In Elliott Management's corner was the New York-based hedge fund's head of U.S. activism, Jesse Cohn, and portfolio manager Marc Steinberg, they said.
Chief among Elliott Management's concerns: The need for Twitter to have a full-time CEO, rather than one who splits his time, as Dorsey does, between the social media company and mobile payment platform Square Inc.
In a year in which major news events are colliding -- the spread of the coronavirus, the U.S. presidential election, the Summer Olympics -- Elliott Management thinks Twitter needs the undivided attention of a CEO to oversee the role it plays in disseminating information, the people said.
The meeting -- the first face-to-face talks between San Francisco-based Twitter's board and the activist since Elliott Management raised its concerns -- was productive and expected to lead to further conversations, they said.
The hedge fund, which was founded by billionaire Paul Singer in 1977 and manages about $40 billion of assets, has taken a stake of more than $1 billion in Twitter and nominated four directors, including Cohn, people familiar with the details said.
Twitter has a staggered board, which means only three of its directors will stand for election at the 2020 annual meeting, which has yet to be scheduled but last year took place in May. Elliott Management has nominated an extra director in case there are additional vacancies, the people said. Dorsey has a seat on the board.
Representatives for Elliott Management, Twitter and Dorsey declined to comment.
Elliott Management is concerned that Dorsey's other interests -- in addition to his time at Square, the CEO has also floated the idea of spending as much as six months this year working in Africa -- have taken his attention off Twitter and led to the company becoming significantly undervalued. Insiders say some things move at a slower pace at Twitter than at its rivals.
The company, co-founded by Dorsey in 2006, has moved sluggishly when it comes to launching new products, with consistent turnover within its product organization plaguing innovation for years. Although the process reflects Dorsey's thoughtfulness, and his willingness to examine a product from all sides, it can come at the cost of moving too slowly for a consumer internet company in a crowded and competitive industry.
One example, reported by Recode in 2017, saw a significant delay in Twitter expanding the length of tweets from 140 characters to 280 characters. At one point, the company even considered a 10,000-character limit. It eventually settled on doubling the length of tweets, but only after years of discussion and a near-finished version that was never released.
The company also spent years discussing features such as the ability to follow topics, rather than just other users, or to hide replies, seen as a core safety control, before they were eventually rolled out in late 2019, people with knowledge of the process said.
Elliott Management's campaign isn't the first time Dorsey's role has come under fire. Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University's Stern School of Business, said in a December letter that Dorsey's inattention and lack of urgency to address Twitter's underperformance was "understandable" given that 85% of his wealth resides in his ownership stake of Square.
Galloway said at the time that he owned about 334,000 Twitter shares.
Dorsey himself has outlined the different way he views the mobile payment company, telling Rolling Stone magazine: "If you lose 140 characters, people are like, 'Eh.' If you lose $140 or even $1.40, it's important."
In an interview Sunday, Galloway said the company's board suffered from an "idolatry of innovators." He said the board's continued support of Dorsey was "indefensible" given Twitter's underperformance and Dorsey's divided loyalties.
Since Dorsey returned as CEO in July 2015, the company's stock has fallen more than 6%, while that of rival Facebook Inc. has more than doubled.
"The board clearly has evidence that it has not shared with the rest of us that Jack Dorsey is Jesus Christ," Galloway said. "The Twitter board makes the WeWork board look responsible."
How Dorsey manages his time has come under scrutiny. The CEO typically spends his mornings at Twitter and then his afternoons at Square, which has offices just a block away on San Francisco's busy Market Street.
Dorsey, who has said he sleeps 8 1/2 hours a night, has held both jobs since he returned to Twitter as CEO in 2015 after a break from the role. His teams are used to coordinating with each other, the people said, but it can still take away from his ability to commit to either company in the way a full-time CEO might.
Dorsey also traveled a lot last year, with Twitter finance chief Ned Segal telling Bloomerg TV this month that the CEO had visited about 30 countries. The 43-year-old billionaire Dorsey has been a strong proponent of remote work, encouraging Twitter employees to follow suit when necessary.
They'll be needing those skills more than ever this week: Twitter joined many companies in announcing Sunday that it's suspending all "non-critical business travel and events" to help protect staff from the new coronavirus. It followed up Monday by encouraging its employees to work from home if possible.
The travel suspension is unlikely to stop Dorsey from making his first appearance since Elliott Management's stake in the company was revealed: He's scheduled to appear Thursday at a Morgan Stanley conference in San Francisco.

Critics say requirement for medical waiver takes away parents' rights
When Maine's voters head to the polls in the presidential primaries Tuesday, they also will cast a vote on an issue many physicians wish had never been politicized - a referendum to overturn a new law that would allow unvaccinated children to attend school only if they have received a waiver from a medical professional.
The new law, which would take effect in September 2021, aims to boost immunization among school-age children in a state where just over 5 percent of kindergartners are unvaccinated not only for medical reasons but because of their parents' religious or philosophical beliefs. That puts Maine below the 95 percent threshold that public health officials say is necessary to stop the spread of preventable and sometimes deadly diseases like the measles.
The referendum was added to Tuesday's ballot after opponents of the new law gathered sufficient signatures to trigger a vote. In many states, misinformation campaigns have raised fears about the alleged dangers of immunization, which extensive research has shown are unwarranted.
"Certainly, referendums are not my ideal method for determining public health policy," said Laura Blaisdell, a pediatrician and vice president of the Maine Academy of Pediatrics, who said the new law had become necessary after efforts to educate parents in the exam room and in the community had failed "to stem the dangerous tide."
"Our perspective is that it's a massive overreach on the part of the state to take away parents' rights," countered Cara Sacks, campaign manager for Yes on 1. The group has found another boogeyman in "Big Pharma," which Sacks blames "for driving the mandates." She said she is "cautiously optimistic" that her grass-roots movement will win Tuesday.
The two have been locked in a battle over hearts and minds and ultimately the ballot box, appearing in town halls, on live TV and in radio talk shows.
The debate - and the forum in which it will be decided - has exposed the delicate relationship between the law and public health. Legislation has long helped normalize safe behaviors like wearing seat belts. But some supporters of immunization argue that stringent laws can be blunt instruments when applied to an issue like vaccines that plays on people's fears, even if they are misguided.
"They risk creating a backlash," said Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, motivating worried parents to look for other ways to avoid immunizations they mistakenly believe are harmful.
"Parents may not be right, but if that is what you believe, your choice is to home-school, move out of state or find a doctor to write a medical exemption," Salmon said. 
The problem that needs to be addressed, physicians say, is widespread misinformation. Salmon says that as many as one out of every three or four parents has concerns about the ingredients in vaccinations, the number of immunizations given at one time, and rumored links to autism that are not supported by science. 
Maine's law was passed last year amid heightened concern about measles outbreaks, following a drop in vaccination rates in several communities, including Eastern European immigrants outside Portland, Ore., the Somali community in Minnesota and ultra-Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn.
The highly contagious and sometimes fatal illness was eliminated in the United States in 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Between January and September of last year, 1,249 cases were reported, the highest annual number since 1992. Ten percent needed to be hospitalized.
New York passed legislation eliminating the religious exemption for public school students. Washington state chose a narrower approach - removing the personal belief exemption only for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.
The referendum in Maine comes amid fears about a new disease - covid-19, caused by coronavirus - for which there is not yet a vaccination and probably won't be one for a year or more.
"Right now, unimmunized American children are at far greater risk of severe disease and death from measles than coronavirus," said Ruth Karron, a pediatrician, professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and founding director of the Johns Hopkins Vaccine Initiative.
Vaccines are often victims of their own success, she said, explaining that parents who have no memory of the misery caused by polio or measles are sometimes reluctant to immunize their children. On the other hand, she said, people's fears of the unknown can increase demand for a vaccine. In the wake of 9/11, amid worries about bioterrorism, people began requesting a smallpox vaccine, even though that particular vaccination can have serious side effects. 
If the Maine law is overturned by popular vote, it would not only set back the state's attempts to protect the population from common childhood diseases but highlight what some physicians see as the risk of mixing public health with politics.
"I'm very concerned about the politicization," said Karron, because of the danger of clouding the scientific message.
"I really think that the public has a right to unfettered and clear communication from our best scientists," she said. "That's what it means to live in a democracy."
"Political issues are divisive," Salmon said. "In vaccines, we need almost everybody's support. If we end up with 50 percent for and 50 percent against, we'll have raging disease."

Worries over medical bills, lost pay could worsen spread

Lack of universal coverage may make U.S. vulnerable, experts say 
The race to curb the spread of the new coronavirus could be thwarted by Americans fearful of big medical bills if they get tested, low-income workers who lose pay if they take time off when sick, and similar dilemmas that leave the United States more vulnerable to the epidemic than countries with universal health coverage and sturdier safety nets.
As the test for the virus becomes more widely available, health-care experts predict that some people with flu-like illnesses - or those who may have been exposed - will avoid finding out whether they have been infected because they are uninsured or have health plans that saddle them with much of the cost of their care.
Making sure the right people get tested - and keeping them away from others if they are infected - is crucial to help diminish the virus's spread within communities as it pops up in a growing number of states.
Now that federal health officials have ironed out initial problems with the test itself and enabled more labs to take part in the hunt for infection, this work of testing and quarantining is the essential second stage. Yet the government has not yet begun to tell Americans where to go for testing, and neither public nor private insurers are changing their rules to buffer people from testing-related charges. 
Some preparations recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are incompatible with the way benefits work. Officials have urged people to keep an adequate supply of their routine medicines in case they end up quarantined. But insurance companies seldom permit refills until a patient is nearly out of pills. The agency also urges people with respiratory illnesses to stay home from work. But with no federal sick leave requirements, some experts predict the virus will spread more rapidly.
For an international, fast-spreading epidemic, the nation's health-care system and many workers' benefits are "certainly not optimally designed," said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms.
Federal funds cover the cost of the coronavirus test itself when it is run in federal, state or local public health laboratories. But that changes as academic and commercial labs get involved. In neither case does the government buffer people from bills for visiting a doctor's office, urgent care center or emergency room, though nearly half of the 160 million Americans with insurance through their jobs have health plans with high deductibles.
"Deductibles are designed to make people think twice about going to the doctor if they are feeling sick," said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health-research organization. "In a potential pandemic, the last thing you want people to do is thinking twice about going to the doctor."
America's Health Insurance Plans, the industry's main trade group, has issued guidance called "Keeping Americans Safe from Coronavirus." The statement says insurers are "carefully monitoring the system" and working with the CDC to share information. 
But it does not urge insurance companies to eliminate out-of-pocket costs for the tests or for visits to doctors or clinics for respiratory illnesses, saying that health plans may want to determine "whether policy changes are needed to ensure that people get essential care."
Thomas Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said eliminating the financial disincentive to get tested "needs to be at the top of the list" of problems that federal health officials tackle. 
Inglesby said that other countries, including Western democracies with government-financed health-care systems, have not been fully publicizing their testing strategies. But he said, "Countries where patients could get large bills for diagnostic testing will have additional challenges identifying people."
Even before the test was widely available in the United States, a few instances of people ending up with large, coronavirus-related medical bills have lit up Twitter.
In one case, a 29-year-old Miami engineer, Osmel Martinez Azcue, had been in China for work, returned home briefly, then flew to Italy for another quick assignment. By the time he arrived home on Jan. 27, he said in an interview, he had spent a miserable, feverish night in the Lisbon airport, popping ibuprofen as he waited for a connecting flight.
His mother, who lives in his apartment building, started researching the coronavirus and convinced him that he needed a test. 
He thought it was probably the flu, but the next morning, he called an urgent care center, which told him that only two hospitals in town could help him.
He went immediately to Miami's public hospital, Jackson Memorial, where emergency room workers, already alerted, said they rushed him into a quarantine room. A nurse in protective gear quizzed him about his travels, and a doctor told him he needed a CT scan, Azcue said. 
He knew the inexpensive insurance he had switched to in the fall requires him to pay $5,000 upfront, so he asked the doctor to first give him a routine flu test, and, if it was positive for influenza, to send him home. 
Less than two hours after he arrived, he left the hospital with a flu diagnosis and a Tamiflu prescription.
On Valentine's Day, a bill arrived from National General Insurance that upset Azcue so much that he did not take his longtime girlfriend out to celebrate. It said he owed $3,270.75 unless he sent the insurer three months of records to prove that the flu had not been a preexisting medical condition. After his story appeared in the Miami Herald, the insurer withdrew the records demands late last week, saying he would owe $1,400.
Said Hopkins's Inglesby: "It is in the public interest for us to have free testing available for people - not just the test itself but the process of getting tested."
So far, doctors are not getting a lot of calls from worried patients, said Robert McLean, president of the American College of Physicians - the professional association of internists - and medical director of a 400-doctor medical group in southern Connecticut affiliated with the Yale New Haven Health System. 
The health system has designed protocols so that "if someone is sick with a cough, everyone gets asked whether they have been to China" or other outbreak sites. "If there is any of that stuff, it gets triaged to a doctor for a phone call."
But Scott Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said he was thinking about the health system's capacity the other night, when his wife wasn't feeling well after work with what turned out to be the flu. They went to an urgent care clinic in suburban Maryland that was crowded. 
"I'm thinking, this place is busy, and it's a one-and-a-half-hour wait now. And we don't have community spread here. What's going to happen? We are going to quickly overwhelm clinics," he said.
Meanwhile, Georgetown's Corlette said work-related worries may also deter people from taking time off to get a test or staying home if they are sick. She noted that nearly one-third of all workers - and more than two-thirds of all low-income workers - do not get paid sick days. 
"Workers who serve our food, take care of our elderly, take care of our kids, change our sheets - that's a thing that should be keeping people up at night," she said.

Considered propaganda arms for Beijing, firms caught up in media war
In a major escalation of a media war between Beijing and Washington, the Trump administration on Monday ordered four Chinese news outlets operating in the United States to reduce the number of Chinese nationals working on their staffs by more than a third.
The action comes on the heels of a State Department decision on Feb. 18 requiring five Chinese news organizations considered organs of the government to register as foreign missions and provide the names of employees.
China responded by expelling three Beijing-based Wall Street Journal reporters, condemning as "racist" an essay that ran in the news outlet's opinion section criticizing China's response to the coronavirus outbreak.
U.S. officials said that by March 13, the Chinese news outlets can have no more than 100 Chinese citizens on staff, down from 160 currently employed by the five outlets. The officials said it was an effort to bring "reciprocity" to the U.S.-China relationship and to encourage the ruling Chinese Communist Party to show a greater commitment to a free press. They noted that only 75 American reporters are known to be working in China.
"As we have done in other areas of the U.S.-China relationship, we seek to establish a long-overdue level playing field," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. "It is our hope that this action will spur Beijing to adopt a more fair and reciprocal approach to U.S. and other foreign press in China. We urge the Chinese government to immediately uphold its international commitments to respect freedom of expression, including for members of the press."
In announcing the move, senior administration officials cited the disappearance of citizen journalists chronicling the outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan. In a report by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China, called "Control, Halt, Delete," 8 in 10 correspondents said they had encountered interference, harassment or violence while reporting and described the environment for journalists as deteriorating.
"We're witnessing an assault on free speech inside of China that goes even beyond what it was a decade ago," said an administration official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity under administration rules for briefing reporters.
The caps were imposed proportionately on four of the five designated outlets: Xinhua News Agency at 59, the China Global Television Network at 30, the parent company of the China Daily at nine and China Radio International at two. The fifth designated outlet, the distributor for the People's Daily, was not capped because it has no Chinese citizens working in the United States.
All the outlets employ Americans as well as Chinese, so the caps will not eliminate their ability to cover news in the United States. But State Department officials refused to call the affected employees journalists, saying they work for propaganda organs.
Officials said it will be up to the news organizations to determine which Chinese citizens to let go by the March 13 deadline. It is not clear how many will have to leave the country or when because it depends on the type of visas they have.
The government in Beijing and the four outlets were notified of the restrictions Monday morning. A U.S. official declined to speculate on how Beijing may respond but said that if they retaliate against foreign reporters in Beijing, "all options are on the table."
An administration official said it would be "a shame" if Beijing retaliates against reporters working in China, predicting it could lead to a pullback of investor confidence in the country.
"American news outlets aren't part of the U.S. government," the official said. "That's the beauty of our system. They're completely independent. It would be a shame if China decided it wanted to take things out on them."
Every year, hundreds of Chinese citizens are granted visas allowing them to report in the United States, though it was not immediately clear how many are currently working as reporters.
The move against employees of China's government-controlled media comes amid an escalating series of critical statements by Pompeo about Beijing. He has repeatedly criticized the government's maltreatment and detention of Muslim Uighurs, warned U.S. allies of risks associated with technology from the Chinese company Huawei and castigated Beijing's expanding economic influence in developing countries.
Pompeo has said Beijing is intent on international domination, and during a January visit to London, he called the Chinese Communist Party "the central threat of our times."
Now, as the world braces for the spreading coronavirus that originated in China, Pompeo has taken the battle to the journalistic arena.
After China expelled the Wall Street Journal reporters, Pompeo issued a statement deriding Beijing's reaction, suggesting it was acting juvenile.
"Mature, responsible countries understand that a free press reports facts and expresses opinions," Pompeo said in a statement. "The correct response is to present counter arguments, not restrict speech."
Then, Pompeo accused China of covering up the magnitude of the coronavirus outbreak and allowing it to spread and endanger people around the world.
"Expelling our journalists exposes, once again, the governance issue that led to SARS and, now, the coronavirus, namely censorship," he said in a news conference, applauding the "brave reporters" covering the outbreak in China.

Fearful hordes hoarding masks put workers at risk

This is embarrassing, America.
Thanks to our collective refusal to listen to facts, paint department managers across the country aren't talking about eggshell, semigloss, sanding or chemically stripping so much right now.
"Masks, masks, that's all I've done the past two days is tell people we're out of masks," said Bob Moore, an Air Force veteran who works in the paint department at a Lowe's in suburban Maryland.
That's not all he - and many others - want to tell them.
"Seriously people - STOP BUYING MASKS!" U.S. Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams said in a tweet on Saturday morning, speaking for Moore, paint store workers and so many others. "They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can't get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!"
True, and Adams didn't even mention a whole other population of workers who are now at risk thanks to America's uneducated mask obsession - the ones who guys like Moore deals with daily at his Bowie store.
"Now we have all these people who use them for painting or insulation work and can't get them," he said. "We're getting complaints, but we can't help them. This is happening at all the stores all over."
Anyone who works with chemicals, paint, drywall dust, insulation, fiberglass, silica, sawdust or mold will be vulnerable to lung damage and diseases like silicosis if they can't get the protective masks that are usually part of their tool kit.
Independent painting and construction contractors are coming in and finding empty shelves. The big firms that get automatic warehouse shipments are also being shut out.
This also means that the folks who are truly vulnerable to any kind of flu - let alone the coronavirus - are unprotected, too.
"My mother is in a nursing home, and they're all worried about getting sick all the time," said Carolyn Williams, who was just turned down at the paint department of her hometown hardware store in Bowie.
I visited hardware stores across the region this weekend and found the same thing - empty shelves everywhere.
Some of the hardware store folks I talked to said it began with Chinese Americans buying up huge lots of the masks to send to families in China last month.
"Then, when it happened in Italy, I had Italians coming in to buy them. Now it's folks who want masks to send back to families in Africa," Moore said.
It's not just masks that people are stockpiling. Costco was a demolition derby of carts loaded with food, toilet paper, hand sanitizer and bleach.
"Gloves. They're even buying all the rubber gloves," one clerk at the D.C. Costco told me, her head shaking in disbelief.
When my son got his hair cut in a downtown D.C. salon this weekend, the front desk dude with pink hair wore a mask and chic black gloves.
"Everyone's coughing," he complained. "I can't be too careful."
There's already a mask black market. One Craigslist seller was offering the $23 Home Depot 15-pack of N95 masks for $175. On Amazon, the most popular masks are on back order until mid-April.
Workers all over are complaining about difficulty getting the protective gear they need, tying T-shirts or bandannas around their faces to make do. All because of panic.
Panic buying is nothing new. We've seen it when the forecast calls for four inches of snow, and we've seen it when tensions have escalated with foreign countries.
But even in an era when we have boundless access to information, we have managed to ignore the facts.
It was 20 years ago that people stockpiled canned food because the Y2K bug was coming for everyone. That was followed three years later by a run on the duct tape and plastic sheeting that might save us from terrorists and anthrax. 
Our fears always seem to overtake common sense.
Chinese restaurants across the nation have gone quiet. The popular Rockville branch of Peter Chang has seen a 50 percent drop in revenue since news of the coronavirus hit last month, according to Washingtonian magazine.
Beer drinkers (maybe about 4 percent of those asked in a recent survey) are avoiding Corona beer because of the virus. It shouldn't have to be said, but for the record, Corona beer can't give you the coronavirus.
Sure, the unknown is scary. One too many zombie virus thrillers and we want to be prepared for any unseen event. But in this case, overpreparedness can hurt others.
The N95 mask will not save you from coronavirus, but it may save the lungs of someone doing dirty, dusty, toxic work.
Listen to the information, understand what people like the top doctor in America are saying and let the nation's paint folks get to the springtime palette and brush techniques they'd rather be talking about.

Airlines, U.S. officials argue over passenger information

Agencies seek data for those who may have been exposed to virus
U.S. officials are pressuring airline executives to turn over the email addresses and phone numbers of international passengers as the Trump administration tries to track who may have been exposed to the coronavirus, according to five people briefed on the situation.
Government officials have said they need the data so they can warn local authorities about who might have been exposed to the virus. But the airline industry has balked, saying the federal government should instead share information it already collects among different agencies and come up with a system for obtaining the rest.
The impasse has dragged on for weeks despite concerns about the growing number of people with coronavirus in the United States. It has become a top issue of the Trump administration's virus task force and U.S. lawmakers. Airline executives are slated to meet with Vice President Pence on Wednesday.
The airline industry has pushed Congress to intervene, with some lobbyists asking lawmakers to insert a provision in an emergency spending package that would effectively absolve the airlines of having to track some of the data.
A failure to resolve the issue could complicate the government's efforts to contain the outbreak's spread. United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines deferred questions to Airlines for America, a lobbying group that represents the airline industry. Airlines for America said collecting the data shouldn't be the airlines' job since the government already has much of it in existing databases. They also said it would take as long as a year for the airlines to set up a tracking system.
The battle over the data has taken on new urgency in recent days.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is asking airlines to collect and - when ordered - submit data from passengers on select international flights within 24 hours in an electronic format. That data might include an email, a phone number and an address in the United States. In the event a passenger on a flight develops covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, that information would enable health officials to reach others who may have been exposed, a system known as "contact tracing." On Feb. 7, the Department of Health and Human Services issued an interim rule requiring certain passenger data to be shared with federal officials.
"Contact tracing is effective at reducing cases of communicable disease at the early stages of a potential outbreak if the contacts are notified as soon after initial exposure as possible," the CDC said when it announced the Feb. 7 policy. "If an efficient contact system is not in place when the first ill passengers arrive, the benefits of the contact tracing are greatly diminished."
The CDC has growing concerns about getting the information it needs for its contact tracing program, saying that under current regulations, it can take nearly two weeks to obtain the traveler data. Even then, some of the information is incomplete.
The passenger data issue has raised alarms at meetings of the U.S. coronavirus task force, according to an official at the Department of Health and Human Services, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about internal meetings. Ken Cuccinelli, acting deputy secretary of homeland security, also flagged the issue during internal administration meetings Saturday, according to another official familiar with the discussions.
Officials say there is greater urgency given the Trump administration's new travel restrictions affecting Iran, Italy and South Korea. With cases emerging in recent days in Washington state, Oregon, Rhode Island, Florida and New York, the federal government and the airline industry face enormous pressure to put in place a tracking system amid fears of the coronavirus's spread.
"When the goal is containment, timing is of the essence," said Josh Michaud, associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. "The earlier you are able to find these people, get them into testing and, if needed, quarantine, the more likely you are to prevent future spreading."
In the three weeks since HHS's rule was put into effect, airlines have turned over some information, but it has been "incomplete," according to the HHS official. U.S. officials want to know who was traveling on planes that were later determined to be transporting passengers who had the coronavirus. For example, if a passenger on a flight from Italy two weeks ago tested positive for the virus last week, CDC officials want to track down fellow passengers on that flight to monitor their health and determine who else might have been exposed.
Right now, when a plane from China lands in the United States, U.S. citizens who are not sick and not showing symptoms are given instructions at the airport to monitor themselves for symptoms, such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing. After they reach their final destination, they are supposed to stay home and monitor their health for 14 days from the time they left China. If they develop symptoms, they are supposed to contact their health-care providers and their local public health authorities.
The CDC wants passenger data from the airlines so the agency can pass it on to states and counties, allowing those front-line authorities to "call in and check in on" those individuals to make sure they are not sick, the official said. CDC officials regard this basic information as critical to efforts to control the spread of the virus.
The airlines have been warning the government at least since the beginning of February that they lack the capacity to quickly set up a tracking system, said Nicholas E. Calio, CEO of Airlines for America. Creating the system could take a year or longer, Calio said, and airlines often do not have the necessary passenger information available to them if flights were booked with a third party.
Most of the airlines' current systems would have to be reprogrammed to collect additional data, and the airlines contend that they have no way of verifying that the information they receive is accurate.
"We have some of the information, but we don't have all of it," said Sharon Pinkerton, senior vice president for legislative and regulatory policy at Airlines for America.
In a letter to HHS, Calio wrote that roughly 74 percent of all passengers list a phone number and 56 percent list an email address in the "passenger name record," a type of government database that tracks travelers. Calio also said that the airline industry was willing to work with the federal government to address any gaps.
Airline companies have asked Congress to require HHS to create a portal that sends passenger information to the CDC, according to a memo sent by industry lobbyists to lawmakers and described to The Washington Post.
Such a legislative measure would effectively absolve the airlines of having to track and send the information to the CDC, but it is unlikely to be approved when Congress takes up the broader emergency package this week, according to two congressional aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe fast-moving negotiations. Calio said the airlines are willing to pay to develop an online database in which travelers directly provide their information to the CDC.
Lawmakers are hoping to resolve the impasse quickly. In addition to the meeting between airline executives and Pence, airline lobbyists are also expected to meet this week with members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who chairs the panel's subcommittee on aviation and space.

Exit polls show Israeli leader in better position to form government
JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vaulted ahead of his main challenger in national elections Monday, according to exit polls, with the strong showing by his Likud party bringing him to the brink of a parliamentary majority.
But the poll results put Netanyahu's right-wing bloc two seats shy of achieving that governing majority in the 120-seat parliament, or Knesset, and breaking a year-long impasse in Israeli politics. Official results being tabulated overnight could hand his coalition an outright victory - or leave it even further out of reach. 
With Israelis voting in national elections for the third time in less than year, the unexpectedly strong performance was a victory for Netanyahu, who had failed to wrest a governing majority in the past two votes and was indicted in November on charges of bribery, fraud and abuse of trust. His corruption trial is scheduled to start later this month. 
"This is a night of great victory," Netanyahu said to jubilant supporters. "We won against all odds. They eulogized us, but we prevailed. We made lemons into lemonade."
The exit poll results came as a jarring disappointment to Netanyahu's main rival, Benny Gantz, a ramrod-straight former military chief who presented himself as the ethical antithesis of Netanyahu. While Gantz's performance as a political newcomer produced solid results in the first two elections, he seems to have fallen short Monday. 
Gantz was defiant early Tuesday, telling supporters that he would fight on.
"I'm not afraid of a long journey," Gantz said. "I'm not afraid at all."
Exit polls from three Israeli television stations gave Netanyahu's Likud either 36 or 37 seats, with Gantz's Blue and White party taking 32 or 33 seats. Netanyahu's overall coalition, which includes several allied religious and right-wing parties, combined for 59 seats in each of the exit polls. That is better than his bloc's position after the previous election but a seat less than after the election last April. Netanyahu was not able to form a government after either vote.
Officials results are expected by early Tuesday and, if they confirm the exit polls, could signal a continuation of the stalemate that has plagued Israeli politics for months.
"Sixty seats doesn't guarantee anything," said former U.S. ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro. "A fourth election is still possible."
Gantz's Blue and White party, which was formed a year ago as a center-left alternative to the prime minister's coalition, did well enough in the April election to deny Netanyahu an outright victory, by a single seat. In the September do-over vote, Gantz's side won more seats in the Knesset but failed to cobble together a governing coalition.
While campaigning ahead of the three-peat election, Netanyahu waged a diplomatic blitz, including a visit to the White House to join President Trump for the release of his Middle East peace plan and another to Moscow to bring home an Israeli backpacker jailed on drug charges.
The prime minister also pushed back relentlessly against the corruption allegations, blasting what he said was a rigged justice system that was desperate to remove him from office.
"He does amazing things, and everybody around the world knows this," said bus driver Yehuda Pinkosov, 63, a Netanyahu supporter from Modi'in. "The left is just looking for ways to hurt him and remove him."
The Likud party put tremendous energy into motivating its traditional voters. And in the end, they rallied to Netanyahu's side, turning out in higher numbers than in the previous elections. 
"Netanyahu got people to come out and vote for him. He realized correctly there were only a few votes in play and that this election was all about turnout," said Jonathan Rynhold, a professor of political studies at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. "He did not have to convince people to vote for him, but he needed to get people to go out and vote."
While the election was the third in less than a year, turnout outpaced the previous two elections, a surprise for many political observers who had predicted voters would stay away because of spiking coronavirus fears and electoral exhaustion. The final tally put turnout at 71 percent, the highest since 2015.
Hundreds of voters who are in precautionary quarantine because of possible exposure to coronavirus donned masks and gloves and went to more than a dozen special biohazard voting places staffed by paramedics.
The fears of infectious disease had been only the latest worry for an electorate anxious from nonstop politicking, adding hand-washing to the hand-wringing. 
"I'm totally following it, and I'm totally frustrated," Jon Pollin, a Jerusalem-based tech executive who had voted twice before for the liberal Meretz party but was thinking of switching this time to Gantz's Blue and White party. "And I'm going to be even more frustrated when we're right back here for a fourth election."
In Modi'in, a city of almost 93,000 halfway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, voters at Dorot Elementary School expressed a mix of fatigue, exasperation and growing uncertainty over the state of Israel's political system and how it is working for them.
"It's getting surreal," said Galia Meir, 42, who declined to say which party's ballot she had just dropped into the box. "This time, people are more confused and unsure about how to vote. Every time, clarity is going down and down. The longer this goes on, the more the slogans just make us lose trust in our leaders."
Meir, an attorney at the Finance Ministry, has fretted at seeing the wheels of government grind to a near-halt in the year of political limbo. "I've seen projects that were approved but are stalled without money from the budget," she said.
Razi Elbaz, a coder and part-time musician in a black Vans T-shirt, would say only that he had not voted for Likud. He also expressed fear of what the intractable division was starting to do to the country. The lack of government stability was one risk, he said, and deepening civic anger was another. 
"I know people who vote for different parties than their family, and it causes real tension for them," he said, before heading off to join the throngs of Israelis crowding local parks, malls and cafes for the rest of the day off. 
Pinkosov, the bus driver, had just voted without fear or confusion, casting his third ballot in a row for the religious Shas party that is part of Netanyahu's coalition. 
"I killed two birds with one stone, voting for Shas and voting for Netanyahu to stay," Pinkosov said with pride as his wife and daughter nodded in agreement. None expressed any doubt about Netanyahu's integrity or commitment to Israel.
Israel's Arab political parties also celebrated the early results. The group of Arab Israeli parties, which ran together again under the Joint List banner, won 14 or 15 seats, according to the three exit polls, maintaining a place as the Knesset's third-largest faction. The Arab vote has grown over each of the past three elections, reflecting greater political participation by Palestinians who are citizens of Israel.
"Our public went to the polls in droves in the past two hours," said Ayman Odeh, a Knesset member from Haifa and leader of the Joint List. "It means that we have a responsible public that understood the enormity of the times."
The final stretch of the latest campaign had largely devolved into a mud fight. Political commentators noted Sunday that tactics had reached a new and dirty low even by Israel's rough-and-tumble standards, after voice recordings of political advisers that reflected badly on their candidates - one working with Netanyahu and one working with Gantz - were leaked to the press over the weekend.

Prediction Markets Are Far From a Sure Bet Ahead of Super Tuesday; Bets on Hillary Clinton, who isn't running, offer some of the best odds on one online marketplace

Betting markets show Hillary Clinton is one of the top contenders in the race for the Democratic nominee.
She isn't running for president.
Prediction markets have become a popular, though not necessarily reliable, way for people to bet on political results. While notoriously volatile and often proven wrong, betting markets are drawing extra scrutiny ahead of this week's Super Tuesday contests.
Consider PredictIt, an online market run by New Zealand's Victoria University of Wellington. Offering a range of election and other political bets, PredictIt currently shows a bettor can pay 7 cents to win $1 if Mrs. Clinton wins the Democratic nomination. Those are the fourth-best odds of any nominee, better than those of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
Perhaps the prediction markets know something others don't, but Mrs. Clinton isn't a candidate. (A PredictIt spokesman said Mrs. Clinton's odds were likely a reflection of "trader long-shot bias" and the possibility of a brokered convention, among other factors.)
Other metrics also show extremes that don't mesh with what more traditional political polls show. Bettors at one point on PredictIt last month gave former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg a 33% chance of winning the nomination.
Those odds—which placed him in second place at the time and came on some of the heaviest volume PredictIt has logged over the past 90 days—were also far higher than the probabilities he garnered in other political polls.
The 2020 presidential election campaign has largely been a secondary factor driving recent financial-market performance. Stocks are coming off their worst week since the financial crisis on fears of how the spreading coronavirus, or Covid-19, could crimp the global economy and corporate profits.
Yet some investors also are trying to decipher what the Super Tuesday outcomes could mean for markets, particularly as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders appears to be moving closer to securing the nomination.
Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, said the markets' recent swoon was driven by "rising Covid-19 fears, and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders' strong momentum."
Mixing politics and portfolios has historically had a mixed record. The conventional wisdom heading into the 2016 presidential election was a Donald Trump victory would prompt stocks to go down. Betting markets played down then-candidate Trump's chances. Of course, the opposite played out.
Goldman Sachs analysts said prediction markets suggest a divided federal government is the most probable election outcome, one that could lead to additional uncertainty if corporate tax reform implemented under President Trump is reversed. Under that scenario, Goldman said, "the impact on S&P 500 profits would be significant."
The firm is no longer expecting U.S. companies to post any earnings growth in 2020. It expects exporters will register falling demand and companies will suffer from supply-chain disruptions as a result of the spreading coronavirus outbreak, which could pose widespread disruptions on people's everyday lives and business activity and imperil the U.S. economy's longest expansion on record.
"An economic slowdown caused by this virus certainly increases Bernie's chances," said Dave Lutz, managing director and head of ETF trading at JonesTrading.
The thinking is a struggling economy, or even a recession, could hurt Mr. Trump's odds at being re-elected, paving the way for whoever becomes the Democratic nominee. PredictIt shows Mr. Sanders has a greater-than-50% chance of securing the nomination, but only a 31% chance of beating President Trump in the election.
One indicator Goldman Sachs analysts are watching is second-quarter gross domestic product growth. Historically, this has been one of the most important metrics to watch in gauging a sitting U.S. president's re-election probability.
"If Covid-19 becomes widespread and leads to a slowdown in U.S. growth or a recession, it could alter current expected election outcomes," Goldman said.

Long-Term U.S. Treasury Yields Hit Record Lows; Futures market expects 0.5 percentage point rate cut by Federal Reserve in March

Yields on U.S. government bonds fell to fresh lows Monday despite a rebound in stocks, reflecting bets that central banks will act to battle the economic effects of the coronavirus epidemic.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at a record low 1.085%, according to Tradeweb, down from the previous low of 1.127% set on Friday.
Yields, which fall when bond prices rise, also declined across Europe after Japanese and U.K. central banks followed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in attempting to reassure markets .
Futures markets show that investors are betting the Fed will cut rates by 0.5 percentage point in two weeks' time, according to data from CME Group. That would take interest rates to a 1%-1.25% range. One week ago, the market was pricing only a 20% chance of a 0.25 percentage point cut, illustrating the stark change in investors' views about the threat from the novel coronavirus.
"Given it's seen as a global shock, a coordinated easing cycle can take hold in our view," said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. "It's the Fed which has the most room to ease, while the rest in key economies are just there for moral support at this stage. In Europe and Japan, the need is for stronger fiscal which can make a difference in supporting growth."
On Friday afternoon, Mr. Powell noted the evolving risks from the outbreak and said the U.S. central bank would act to support the economy. On Monday, Japan's Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said the Bank of Japan would support markets with ample funds.
The Bank of England said it was working closely with government and international partners to ensure all necessary steps were taken to protect financial and monetary stability, raising the prospect of coordinated central bank action to combat the economic effects of the virus.
Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia could become the first central bank to respond to the crisis if it cuts rates at its meeting Tuesday.
Last week, investors flocked to government bonds in part because of a steep decline in stocks, which left them searching for safer assets. Bets on lower short-term interest rates, though, also dragged down yields, and that dynamic continued Monday even as investors recovered some of their appetite for riskier assets.
The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is particularly sensitive to changes in monetary policy, settled at 0.824%, compared with 0.878% Friday.

Election-Weary Israelis Vote for Third Time to Try to Break Deadlock; Israel is voting for the third time in under a year after previous attempts have failed to return a government

TEL AVIV—Israelis went to the polls in their third national election in less than a year, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought to fend off a challenge from his main rival Benny Gantz . But voters fear that Monday's ballot could end in yet another deadlock .
Israelis were casting ballots in a parliamentary election that pits Mr. Netanyahu, a political survivor who is the country's longest-serving prime minister and is currently under indictment for corruption , against Mr. Gantz, a former Israeli military chief who leads the Blue and White Party.
The ideological differences between the two center-right leaders are slim. Instead, as in the previous votes, the ballot is largely a referendum on Mr. Netanyahu's more than 13 years in power .
Mr. Gantz has tried to rally Israel's electorate around a sense of fatigue over Mr. Netanyahu's long reign and has used the prime minister's legal troubles to drive home the message that Israel needs change.
"We just need to get Bibi out. It doesn't matter if he's guilty or not. He should deal with his trial," said Avi Kadranel, 47, from Tel Aviv, using a nickname for Mr. Netanyahu. "He can't lead the government and his trial at once. I need someone who will work just for me."
Mr. Kadranel said he would have considered voting for the prime minister's Likud party if it wasn't for Mr. Netanyahu and voted instead for Blue and White. "It doesn't matter who wins. This needs to be the last time."
Mr. Gantz has also criticized Mr. Netanyahu's reliance on religious parties for support, describing the government ministers from those parties as extremists who are unqualified for their jobs. Mr. Gantz, 60, has also questioned the prime minister's stewardship of the country's security, seen by many of Mr. Netanyahu's supporters to be his signature strength.

Mr. Netanyahu, meanwhile, presented himself as an indispensable statesman whose relationships with President Trump and Arab Gulf leaders had elevated Israel's status in the world. The Israeli leader, who has been in power for more than a decade since returning to the prime minister's office in 2009, has also touted his security record and tough stance on Iran, as well as Israel's economic success under his tenure.
"We've become a leading country in the world. All of this thanks to Netanyahu," said Shlomo Aharon, 67, a taxi driver from Bat Yam. He said Mr. Netanyahu's legal troubles are "all made up," adding: "It's known that if you want to get rid of someone you make up an allegation against him."
Monday's parliamentary vote follows national elections last April and September that ended largely in a deadlock, with neither Mr. Netanyahu nor Mr. Gantz being able to form coalitions of more than 61 seats needed for a majority in the 120-seat legislature or Knesset.
Monday's vote threatens to produce the same outcome. The final opinion polls last week showed Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz in a dead heat, neither with the majority needed to form a coalition.
The major difference from the previous votes is that Mr. Netanyahu, 70, has since been indicted on corruption charges. His trial will begin on March 17.
He denies wrongdoing and has branded the charges as a politically motivated attempt to force him from power. He must resign as prime minister only if he is convicted.
Under Israeli law, parties must win at least 3.25% of the vote to enter the Knesset. The fragmented nature of the Israeli political landscape means that parties must form coalitions to secure a parliamentary majority and govern.
Following the election, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin will choose the leader he believes most likely to be able to assemble a governing coalition, usually the person whose party has the most votes. That person has six weeks to try to cobble together a majority coalition.
The election is taking place under the cloud of the coronavirus. Israel is operating 16 special polling places for the more than 5,000 Israelis who are currently quarantined after traveling to places affected by the epidemic. Officials in both parties worry that the spread of false information about the coronavirus could drag turnout below September's levels.
Pollsters said that if the outcome is largely the same, political leaders must shift from entrenched positions to avoid a fourth election.
"At this point the voters have done everything they can...we've said it and we're not changing our minds," said Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli political analyst and pollster.
Surging Arab voter turnout could play a key role in preventing Mr. Netanyahu from winning enough support to be able to form a government. About 60% of Arab Israeli voters turned out in September and analysts predict the number will increase, giving the Joint List, a group of Arab parties, as many as 14 or 15 seats.
Mr. Netanyahu has depicted leading Arab Israeli politicians as a danger to the state. That has in turn inspired Israel's Arab voters, who represent about 20% of the population, to go to the polls to protest what they see as Mr. Netanyahu's efforts to delegitimize their political rights.
Arab voters were also incensed by the peace plan presented last month by the Trump administration, a blueprint backed by both Messrs Netanyahu and Gantz, because it suggests putting some Arab towns currently in Israel under Palestinian control and stripping Arab Israelis who live there of their Israeli citizenship.
The Arab parties haven't committed to backing Mr. Gantz's quest to form a government, particularly after he backed the Trump plan, but their support could be crucial if he is going to get a chance to try.
The Trump plan calls for the creation of a Palestinian state but under terms seen as so tilted toward Israel that Palestinian officials in the West Bank and Gaza immediately rejected it. Its terms include allowing Israel to unilaterally annex parts of the West Bank .
Mr. Netanyahu made last-minute promises to advance settlement construction projects in East Jerusalem and elsewhere in the West Bank that would significantly hurt the possibility of a contiguous Palestinian state.
"More and more people are seeing that there needs to be a pushback against the system," said Diana Buttu, a Palestinian Israeli activist and lawyer who lives in Haifa. "Most of the time you're voting for a person because you want him to win. Here it's not that we expect them to win, but that we want to have sufficient pushback."

Companies have endured financial meltdowns, civil wars and natural disasters. Now they are confronting a different kind of menace: a fast-spreading coronavirus that has abruptly dented supply and demand across industries and continents.
The virus, which has infected more than 85,000 people, has swept through Asia and Europe, disrupted global travel and hobbled supply chains that churn out everything from smartphones to pharmaceuticals. In days, it went from pockets of woe to the top concern of chief executives world-wide.
Conferences are getting canceled, including the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston and Facebook Inc.'s F8 developer gathering in California. Disneyland Tokyo is closed. Auto suppliers are warning of parts shortages. Generic-drug manufacturers are paying 50% more for some raw materials.
The organizers of CERAWeek, one of the world's top annual energy events, made public their decision on Sunday citing, among other things, "growing concern about large conferences with people coming from different parts of the world."
The epidemic's widespread nature and related uncertainty will put a hold on large corporate investments, mergers and hiring, said Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford University economist who has researched the impact of uncertainty on business cycles.
"A lot of the damage is already being inflicted, purely from major decisions being delayed," Mr. Bloom said. "I can't see many firms greenlighting any projects until they can figure out what is going on."
Larry Kudlow, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said on Friday that the threat from the virus for people in the U.S. is low and the "coronavirus is not going to sink the U.S. economy." The White House tightened travel restrictions over the weekend after health officials in Washington state reported the first U.S. death from the illness.
The virus surfaced as U.S. companies were riding atop the country's longest economic expansion on record, matched by soaring stock-market returns. But profit growth for S&P 500 companies started to cool last year, squeezed by rising labor costs and trade disruptions.
Chinese government gauges of activity in the manufacturing and services sectors plunged to record lows in February, the country said on Saturday, dropping into territory that indicates a contraction.
U.S. business activity in February fell to its lowest level in more than six years on fears of the epidemic.
In February, 129 companies in the S&P 500 discussed the coronavirus in their quarterly earnings calls, up from 60 in January, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of transcripts. There were nearly 600 mentions of the virus in companies' security filings in the past week alone, according to Kaleidoscope, a research firm.
Executives have talked about how the virus will curb consumer spending on products from Crocs sandals to Gucci handbags. It has slowed production at nickel mines in Indonesia and halted the filming of "Mission Impossible 7" in Venice.
At the same time, many companies have cautioned it is too early to tell how much the virus might damage business. Economists have struggled to project the extent of the economic fallout, which they said depends on whether the epidemic continues to spread -- and on public reaction if it does. While some forecasters have said the virus's spread in China and elsewhere would slow the U.S. economy in the first quarter, economists expect a swift U.S. recovery from any downturn as companies work to meet pent-up consumer demand after the health threat subsides.
"Every CEO that I know has got to manage an employee dimension, supply-chain dimension, in many cases a revenue dimension," as well as Wall Street's needs, said Mike White, who ran PepsiCo Inc.'s international division in 2003 when SARS hit. He now sits on the boards of Whirlpool Corp., Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Bank of America Corp. "We're still in the middle of the river here," he said.
Whirlpool cited its sales and supply chain in China and elsewhere in Asia in trimming its first-quarter profit guidance on Friday. The appliance maker said the outbreak in northern Italy, where the company has manufacturing operations, would hurt sales there, too.
Airlines have taken one of the hardest, earliest hits from the crisis. Asian and European carriers have implemented cost-cutting measures to accommodate canceled flights to China and curtailed services to other affected areas such as Italy.
On Friday, United Airlines Holdings Inc. postponed until September an investor meeting that was scheduled for March 5, saying it couldn't have a productive conversation on its long-term strategy until the epidemic abates. United is offering certain pilots the option of taking April off with reduced pay, according to a letter from the pilot union chairman to members.
As the spread of the virus in China has slowed, some Chinese factories are reopening, though many are short-staffed and transportation is still difficult. For example, smartphone makers are expected to ship 64 million fewer devices in the first half of 2020, market researcher International Data Corp. said, hampered by component shortages and quarantine mandates.
The disease is still spreading in other countries. Hyundai Motor Co. on Friday stopped building its popular Palisade SUV and other U.S.-sold sport-utility vehicles after a factory worker in South Korea tested positive for coronavirus. Google said on Friday that one of its employees in Zurich had been diagnosed, but the office remains open.
China is a key supplier of chemical and raw materials used by many pharmaceutical manufacturers, a potential problem for popular blood-pressure medicines and several older antibiotics that are no longer manufactured in the U.S. Experts believe China is also the only maker of key ingredients in a class of decades-old antibiotics known as cephalosporins, which treat a range of bacterial infections including pneumonia.
Automotive suppliers are warning car companies they could run out of certain parts used in North American factories in the coming weeks, particularly electronic components. Hoping to stave off factory stoppages, some manufacturers have taken the unusual and costly step of flying in critical parts by cargo planes.
Some companies have benefited from the outbreak, which has spurred buying of respiratory face masks and disinfecting wipes, propping up shares of some makers of such items. Clorox Co.'s stock briefly hit records last week while the broader market plunged.
"The good news is that the shock from the virus is hitting at a time when households appear to be in good shape," wrote Bob Schwartz, a senior economist with Oxford Economics.
Mr. White, the former PepsiCo executive, said the long-term economic outlook is solid even as companies face short-term pressures. "Almost every company is going to have an issue with their first-quarter numbers," he said.

Technology Advances Can Only Go So Far --- Disruptions still affect virtual world

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
[This is the fourth column in a five-part Heard on the Street series about the market and economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic.]
Technology has changed the world since the last major global virus scare, for better and for worse.
Consider the state of things when SARS rocked the global economy in 2003. Cellphones were candy-bar-shaped devices with actual buttons. Most Americans were stuck with dial-up internet speeds at home, which means they watched movies via tape or disc (DVD sales tipped VHS sales in the U.S. just the year before). Computers were heavy towers confined to a desk. And social networking? That was the year Myspace started while Facebook was simply known as "Facemash" -- a tool for Harvard students to rate each other's hotness.
Fast-forward to now, when nearly a third of the world's population uses Facebook or one of its family of apps every day. Most of those are doing so through a full-fledged computing device that fits in their pocket. Powerful, portable devices streaming data at high speeds means information -- and disinformation -- spreads fast. It also means other big changes in how people work and live, which in turn has made the world a much smaller and more interconnected place.
Many of those changes involve lessening the need for in-person interactions. Amazon.com, the world's pre-eminent seller of things over the internet, unveiled a new grocery store in its hometown of Seattle that spares patrons the inconvenience of dealing with cashiers. In China, e-commerce and online takeout companies are trying out delivery robots and autonomous vehicles to avoid human contact. China's mobile payment systems also reduced physical cash transactions.
Movie fans and gamers can now skip stores entirely. A raft of streaming services allows users to watch practically any movie and TV show at home on demand. And videogame consoles and home internet connections have become robust enough that gamers needn't venture to their local GameStop anymore, either. The latest "Call of Duty" game sold about half of its new units as digital downloads, according to publisher Activision Blizzard. Short-video app Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, saw a 76% jump in daily active users in early February, compared with a month earlier, according to data firm QuestMobile.
Even hitting the gym may get passe. Peloton Interactive shares jumped last week after a Needham analyst told clients that the coronavirus outbreak will make U.S. consumers "less comfortable over time going to their gym" and thus more likely to buy one of the company's pricey stationary bikes or treadmills to work out at home.
And then there is Zoom Video Communications. The fairly new public company saw its share price surge 38% in February alone on the notion that the spreading coronavirus will spike corporate demand for its snappy new videoconferencing technology. The recent cancellation of the Mobile World Congress trade show that was set to take place in Barcelona last week seemed to drive that point home. Qualcomm livestreamed the press conference it had planned for the show from its headquarters in San Diego on Tuesday. Students in China have also used videoconferencing apps like Alibaba's DingTalk for online learning as schools remain shut.
But until robots and self-driving cars are running everything in our lives, disruptions in the physical world will still ripple through the virtual one. China's Alibaba, for example, said its e-commerce business was feeling an impact as many delivery workers weren't back to work. Its takeout business, which theoretically could get a boost from more people staying at home, also was hurt as many restaurants closed.
Technology also can't fully replace the need for in-human contact, whether personal or for business. Nor should we want it to. Not all tech-driven changes have been good ones. Social networks and mobile devices feed the spread of misinformation, and even convenience-driven innovations like ride-hailing and food delivery can displace vulnerable smaller businesses while ushering in the growth of less desirable "gig economy" jobs. Lockdowns may glue more people to their screens, but it doesn't mean they have to like it.

Banks Plan Backup Office Sites as Pandemic Prep

U.S. banks are preparing for a worsening coronavirus outbreak by laying plans to move staffers to back-office sites, limiting contact with clients who have been abroad and curbing employee travel.
Morgan Stanley, whose New York City stock-trading floor is the country's busiest, is preparing a backup site in suburban Westchester County. JPMorgan Chase &Co. has nixed all nonessential international trips. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is canceling some conferences and evaluating powering up a parallel trading floor in Greenwich, Conn.
Not since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks have Wall Street banks faced a logistical challenge like the one potentially posed by a coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. Sustained quarantines and widespread business closures would hit credit-card and corporate-lending businesses. Further interest-rate cuts, which the Federal Reserve may use to shore up the economy, would crimp profits.
"If planes are not flying in and out of China, if hotels are not being filled -- which they're not at the moment -- and if the supply chains are being impacted which I suspect they are, there's going to be some impact," Visa Inc. Chief Executive Officer Alfred Kelly said last month.
While technology has made it possible for many to work from home, the multiple screens and compliance systems installed on Wall Street trading floors can't be easily replicated on a laptop. And investment banking is still a face-to-face business, drummed up by weeks on the road.
Financial firms have drawn up elaborate contingency plans in recent years that they hope will allow them to keep operating smoothly. Just a few weeks ago, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. ran a drill temporarily shutting down its downtown Manhattan headquarters, an executive said.
Despite the market meltdown, trading floors at many banks remain calm. One salesperson said increased activity meant it was a bit noisier than usual, but nothing compared with the 2010 flash crash or the weeks leading up to the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.
Banks and brokers have opened backup facilities throughout the world in recent years. Many are required by their regulators to plan and test for various scenarios, said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Evercore ISI. Significant improvements in computing power and telecommunications networks also have made working remotely a possibility for many more employees.
One key obstacle for firms will be how they contend with rules on recording phone calls and other communications related to specific transactions when traders aren't working from their usual desk, one bank executive said. Industry officials are urging regulators to consider relaxing these surveillance rules in the event that employees are forced to work from home, this executive said.
Officials at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, an industry trade group, have raised the surveillance issue in discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission, along with other potential challenges Wall Street would face during a wide-scale evacuation of U.S. trading floors.
"We are providing information to them for them to consider," said Kenneth Bentsen, Sifma's president and CEO. "We haven't made a formal request."
In some ways, the job of girding against pandemic has gotten simpler. The advent of electronic exchanges, trading algorithms and other technological advances on the markets have steadily shrunk the number of employees on trading floors on Wall Street and elsewhere. And many who remain are in roles that can be performed adequately in remote locations.
With the addition of software engineers, compliance staff and other in-demand positions, the securities industry's total New York City workforce rose to 180,300 last year from 165,900 in 2003, according to the New York State Department of Labor. But the number of employees classified by the department as brokers -- or those who serve as intermediaries between buyers and sellers -- has dropped to 53,300 from 73,000 in the same period.
The 12 biggest global investment banks employed 26% fewer equity traders, salespeople and analysts at the end of 2019 than they did in 2010, according to industry-data firm Coalition Ltd. Front-office staff on bond-trading desks have tumbled 42% over the same period, according to Coalition.
That said, the task of limiting health risks is far-reaching. Like other large companies, lenders are limiting employee exposure to countries where the virus has taken hold. Morgan Stanley's upcoming annual Hong Kong summit will be virtual, while Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. have restricted employee travel to Asia and Italy.
Goldman's private bankers are canceling meetings with clients who have been to virus hot spots, according to clients. Registered attendees of several upcoming Goldman conferences received emails asking them to stay home if they recently visited virus-affected regions.
A sign at the front desk of the bank's downtown Manhattan headquarters asks visitors who have recently returned from mainland China -- or been in contact with someone who has -- to reschedule.

Wall Street Girds For Another Week Of Wild Trading

Global investors are bracing for another hair-raising ride, after a week of frantic and at times disorderly trading.
The Dow industrials have dropped seven straight days entering trading Monday, posting their steepest weekly decline since the financial crisis. Their 14% pullback since Feb. 12 places the longest-ever U.S. stock rally in jeopardy of falling into a bear market, marking a 20% decline from a recent high.
The rout has been by the book to some extent. A roaring rally in government bonds has taken the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury to a low of 1.127%. The markets for oil and copper, whose prices reflect in part global economic expectations, have fallen sharply.
But investors were gobsmacked by unexpected developments elsewhere. Gold raced through early 2020 to its highest level in seven years, before dropping 4.6% Friday in its sharpest drop since 2013. High-yield bond funds posted their largest-ever outflow by one measure this past week. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index surged late Friday to close higher for the first time since its record close on Feb. 19, while the Dow and S&P 500 both declined.
Adding to investors' worries, weekend data from China showed the country's economy has taken even more of a hit from the epidemic than some had anticipated. Sentiment among manufacturers' purchasing managers, as well as an index tracking purchasing plans in services industries, both fell to a low in February.
The market tumult has left Wall Street scrambling. Fixed-income traders at JP Morgan Chase &Co. and trading teams at Barclays PLC met late in the week, focusing on preparing for further declines in stocks and commodities. A Federal Reserve statement Friday promising appropriate action wasn't enough to quell nerves on many trading desks. Even those who counsel patience are for now expecting a period of intense volatility.
"When you are getting new information by the minute or by the hour, that creates anxiety in markets," said Joe Amato, president and chief investment officer of equities at Neuberger Berman Group LLC.
The turmoil is increasing trading activity among investors in retirement funds. Alight Solutions, which tracks 401(k) trading activity among investors at large employers, said trading volumes on Thursday were 11.4 times higher than normal. Since 2008, there have only been two other days when trading volumes exceeded 11 times the historical average, says the company.
The downdraft in stocks has created an acute need for cash. Declines in gold and other areas of the market often associated with stability, like the shares of utilities firms, show that investors are being forced to raise cash to make up for losses from stocks, some traders said -- including margin calls to investors who had used stocks as collateral to buy other securities. With the value of those positions shrinking substantially, banks can demand repayment, triggering forced sales of unrelated assets.
"You have a tremendous amount of people who needed cash," said George Gero, managing director at RBC Wealth Management. "There is no haven at the moment with the exception of Treasurys."
A Bank of America survey of fund managers in February showed investors' positioning in cash at the lowest levels since March 2013.
Friday capped one of the worst two-week spans for high-yield credit since the financial crisis, marking the end of a long spell of largely placid trading. Analysts say moves haven't been this violent since 2011, citing jumps in credit-default swap indexes and outflows from high-yield funds.
The average bid for S&P Global Market Intelligence's LCD 15-bond sample of high-yield issues tumbled 2.47 percentage points over the past week, wiping out all 2020 gains on Thursday. Markit's high-yield CDX index dropped nearly 5 points in two weeks, the steepest decline for any comparable period since 2011.
The action is evidence that the rapid evolution of coronavirus has paralyzed Wall Street, some investors say, because there are too many unanswered questions.
For now, many portfolio managers and investors believe the storm will pass, leaving intact a bull market that started in 2009 and has pushed the Dow up some 300%. Some took heart at the frantic late-afternoon rally that narrowed Friday's losses, while others said they believe the selling is likely to prove overdone. "I still think we're in a secular bull market," said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments.
Yet even those who believe the coronavirus scare will blow over are bracing for more volatility as investors struggle to discern the impact on global markets and economies.

With empty dealerships across China and plunging demand for cars, auto makers are accelerating the move to do more business online and take their inventory pile directly to homebound customers.
Online sales of new cars are still such a small part of the market that they barely register in official statistics. And studies show that consumers, in China and elsewhere, still want to walk into a dealership and kick the tires before plunking down a pile of money for a new car.
But with a large number of Chinese consumers staying in their homes because of the coronavirus epidemic, some manufacturers see quarantined China, where visits to the dealership all but disappeared in February, as a test bed for more aggressive online sales.
Volkswagen AG has been training thousands of dealers to take their pitch from the showroom to the chat room. In February, Volkswagen tapped experts from Alibaba Group Holding Inc. and Taobao to offer a three-day online training course for 50,000 salespeople, showing dealers how to use social media, create video and live-stream events to reach customers outside the showroom.
The training covered about 90% of the staff at Volkswagen dealerships and those of its joint-venture partners, said Michael Mayer, head of sales and marketing for Volkswagen's passenger car brands in China. Many of the auto maker's showrooms have been empty or closed in recent weeks, Mr. Mayer said. Only a third of the company's 2,100 dealerships across China are operating.
Volkswagen is shifting some marketing resources away from traditional sales channels. "It doesn't make sense to rent a billboard now, so you shift resources online," Mr. Mayer said. "TV advertising has also gone up; it's now more efficient because people have more time to watch TV."
The coronavirus has pressured car makers to try new sales approaches. In the first two weeks of February, new car sales fell 92%, according to the association of Chinese auto dealers.
For manufacturers, salvaging their China business during the epidemic may depend on how well they have prepared their digital showrooms.
In February, Geely Auto Group, a unit of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, launched an online ordering and home-delivery system, providing a fully "contactless" auto purchasing and payment service with the option of having cars delivered to customers at home. Geely said during the first week of operation, its online sales orders jumped fivefold from the same period a year earlier and sales leads from Geely's website increased 75 times.
Audi AG, the luxury car maker owned by Volkswagen, said its dealerships have remained open in China, but that "at the moment their focus is on the online business."
A BMW spokeswoman said the Munich luxury-car maker is providing dealers in China with an array of "digital toolboxes," including an online application that enables them to make video car presentations and allows customers to view the car without leaving home.
A Ford Motor Co. spokesman said the company is working with its dealers in China to facilitate online sales when necessary, allowing in some cases for financing to be dealt with via email. When necessary, dealers are making home deliveries to customers who can't come into the store.
Car companies have long tried to capitalize on the rise of e-commerce, but that has often conflicted with their large dealership networks. In some markets, like the U.S., franchise agreements require them to only sell cars through dealers. U.S. dealers have lobbied hard against Tesla Inc.'s direct-sales model, blocking the electric car maker from several states.
Some car makers have tried online sales programs through their dealership networks, like General Motors Co.'s Shop-Click-Drive, but found that most car buyers still opt to shop in person for a new vehicle. Online car sales are more prevalent in the used market from startups like Carvana Co. and Shift Technologies Inc. and China's Uxin Ltd.
European dealers operate under a franchise system, but the rules are more flexible than in the U.S. It is easier for companies like Tesla, which only offers online sales, and third-party multibrand online car dealers to do business online.
In China, there are large franchises but also independent dealers, often part of larger chains, that sell many brands under one roof.
In a 2019 study of Chinese consumers, McKinsey &Co. found that by the time consumers were ready to buy a new car at a dealership, they had already obtained 90% of the information they needed to make the purchase. Still, getting behind the wheel in a car for a test drive remains the most important factor for Chinese consumers when deciding whether to buy, the study said, yet more than half of those surveyed would like dealers to deliver the car to their homes for a test drive.

U.S. News: Trump Renews Push for Rate Cut

President Trump said he is counting on the Federal Reserve to shoulder the government's response to economic disruptions caused by the coronavirus, renewing the pressure campaign he has used against the central bank during previous bouts of market uncertainty.
After the stock markets' worst week since the financial crisis, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled in a statement Friday that the central bank is prepared to cut interest rates to cushion the U.S. economy against the effects of a potential public-health emergency and widening global slowdown.
"Good, it's about time," Mr. Trump said at a White House press conference Saturday, referring to the statement. He urged the Fed to reduce interest rates. "We need a Fed that's going to be a leader."
Mr. Trump said talk of an economic stimulus program from the White House or Congress, such as by cutting taxes for households and individuals, is premature.
"The big thing we are looking for is the Fed to do its job," he said. "I don't think the Democrats are going to approve any tax cuts." The administration would unveil tax-cut proposals toward the end of this year, he said.
A Fed spokeswoman declined to comment.
Investors had pushed stocks to record highs previously, sloughing off concerns that the coronavirus epidemic in China would drag the global economy into a prolonged slump. That changed last week, as cases spread in South Korea, Iran and Italy, raising the prospect that public-health officials would need to shift from containing the virus to mitigating its effects.
The S&P 500 suffered its fastest-ever 10% decline from an all-time high last week and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its worst week since the 2008 global financial crisis. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note and 30-year bond hit record lows, a sign of investors fleeing risky assets for havens and of expectations for lower U.S. growth.
As investors looked for reassurance, Mr. Powell reprised language he used when the central bank adopted an easing bias last June. "The coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity," Mr. Powell said. "We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."
Economists and investors now expect the Fed to cut rates at its next scheduled meeting, March 17-18, if not before then. The Fed's benchmark rate has been in a range between 1.5% and 1.75% since October.
Mr. Trump has made the Fed a regular punching bag when the stock market declines or other potential portents of a recession appear.
He called on the Fed to cut rates or criticized its rate policy more than 80 times last year.

Commodities Rout Stokes Fear on Growth

The coronavirus outbreak has sparked one of the largest retreats in commodity prices in years, forcing investors to brace for even steeper declines and sending a warning signal about the world economy's prospects in 2020.
Raw materials sensitive to shifts in global growth have been among the hardest hit investments since the coronavirus began spreading around the globe and hurting travel and corporate activity. Oil prices have fallen 32% in less than two months and last week recorded their worst week since the financial crisis. Industrial metals from copper to aluminum are also taking a beating.
Commodities started falling steadily after China reported its first death from the coronavirus in January and began taking steps to curb its spread, slowing the country's economy early in the year. While stocks held up well at that time, materials fell because China is a critical source of demand, accounting for about half of global consumption of some commodities like copper.
As the virus has spread to other countries, from Italy to South Korea, commodities have fallen alongside global stocks, sending the S&P 500 down 13% in the past seven trading sessions. The pain has extended to agricultural commodities including sugar and cotton.
The broad selloff is a major concern for some analysts because commodity prices can provide a real-time indicator of activity in the world economy. The current slide reflects slumping demand and bloated inventories, a recipe for excess supply. Some investors worry the widespread selling of assets associated with risk also portends more pain ahead for stocks.
"We know there's going to be continued volatility," said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer of Boston Private, which has been maintaining a smaller position in stocks than the benchmark it tracks. "With this uncertainty, you're not really sure what the best place to hide would be."
In addition to monitoring the spread of the virus, investors this week will be watching purchasing managers index figures and data on U.S. hiring for February to gauge how much the world economy might slow this year.
Some analysts say the longest-ever U.S. economic expansion is already in jeopardy. As U.S. crude oil skidded last week to its lowest level since December 2018, ending Friday at $44.76 a barrel, natural gas also extended a monthslong fall. Natural-gas futures dropped to a nearly four-year low of $1.68 a million British thermal units.
The declines have been a boon for consumers who are paying less for gasoline at the pump and to heat their homes with natural gas this winter. But they are also threatening profits for energy-producing companies and nations like Saudi Arabia, some of which need higher prices to sustain their economies.
Donald Morton, a senior vice president at Herbert J. Sims &Co. who oversees an energy trading desk in Haverhill, Mass., said he struggles to remember demand fears this severe in energy markets since the financial crisis more than a decade ago. While he thinks the drop has gone too far, he said the negative sentiment could keep prices down until the virus fears ebb.
"What's occurring is pretty dramatic," he said. "I don't think the price today is reflecting reality."
Hedge funds and other speculative investors have sharply reduced net bets on higher U.S. crude oil prices and recently pushed them to a four-month low, Commodity Futures Trading Commission figures show. At the same time, they have ramped up bets on lower prices of natural gas and copper.
Many analysts expect the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to deepen recent production cuts at a coming meeting, a move that could help stabilize oil prices if efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus are successful. Still, steady shale output from the U.S. and production from nations outside OPEC have many traders preparing for oil inventories to remain well supplied moving forward.
With the declines in stocks and commodities accelerating, investors have favored safer assets, including gold and bonds that tend to hold their value during times of market turmoil. That trend pushed gold to its highest level in seven years last week and sent the ratio of gold prices to oil prices to its highest point since early 2016. During that selloff four years ago, fears that an economic slowdown in China would spark a recession pushed crude prices below $30 a barrel.
But the recent market chaos even engulfed gold late last week, sending prices down 4.6% Friday. Traders said investors were being forced to cover losses from stocks. Another explanation: margin calls from banks to investors who had used some of their stock portfolios as collateral to buy other securities. With the value of those positions shrinking substantially, banks can demand repayment.
Still, oil and other commodities went on to recover from the 2016 tumble alongside stocks, and some traders are hopeful that they can stage a similar recovery. "We see a lot of commodities that are now into the oversold category," Mr. Morton said.

TOKYO -- It was meant to be part of a big buildup to the Olympics. Instead, a stripped-down Tokyo marathon showed the challenge facing Japan to save the 2020 summer Games from the threat of the coronavirus epidemic.
Sunday's race was cut back to about 200 elite runners two weeks ago, eliminating more than 30,000 general participants, to reduce the risk of the spread of the virus. Spectators were also asked to stay home, and for large stretches through central Tokyo, the athletes ran along empty streets.
Japan has been one of the worst-affected countries from the new coronavirus, with more than 900 cases, mostly among passengers and crew on a cruise ship, and 12 deaths. Cases of infection have been reported across Japan and the State Department advises U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution in considering travel to Japan.
Race staff at the Tokyo marathon held up signs at train station exits along the course with a message: "Please refrain from coming to watch." The men's race was won by Birhanu Legese of Ethiopia in two hours, four minutes and 15 seconds.
Doctors took the temperature of the athletes before the race and officials were given surgical masks and asked to use hand sanitizer as a precaution.
On Saturday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he hoped to clear up concerns about the coronavirus epidemic quickly so Tokyo can host the Olympics as scheduled. The opening ceremony is scheduled for July 24.

Business News: Retailers Prepare for Surge in Demand as Virus Spreads

Supermarkets and other retailers are preparing for a surge in demand and shoppers are stocking up on staple foods and cleaning supplies as more cases of the new coronavirus appear in the U.S.
For weeks, as the outbreak advanced mainly in China, retailers focused on maintaining supplies of products they procure from Asia such as tuna, mandarin oranges, garlic and face masks.
Their attention has shifted in recent days as cases multiplied from South Korea to Iran and as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned of a potential pandemic. Health officials in Washington state on Saturday reported the first death of someone who had tested positive for the coronavirus in the U.S. Health officials on Sunday reported two additional cases in Washington and a first case in Rhode Island, adding to dozens of cases across the country.
Now grocers are working to prevent shortages and preparing for a rise in demand for disinfectants, hand sanitizer and long-lasting items such as canned food. Some are ramping up orders from suppliers.
"This is like a natural disaster, but it's an illness," said Doug Baker, vice president of industry relations at FMI, a trade group for food retailers.
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said it has seen greater demand for products including face masks and hand sanitizers at many stores and online. Home Depot Inc. said it had halted online orders for face masks and was limiting purchases at its stores to 10 per customer.
"Our merchandising and supply-chain teams are working hard to replenish these items as quickly as possible whenever inventory runs out in any of our stores," a Home Depot spokeswoman said.
The masks known as N95 respirators that block 95% of very small particles were out of stock at many stores in the Chicago area over the weekend, as were basic medical supplies and hand sanitizer.
Some sellers on Amazon.com Inc. and eBay Inc. had set prices for masks and sanitizer well above levels that are typical for those products at U.S. stores and websites.
One Amazon vendor advertised a 12-pack of 8-ounce bottles of Purell hand sanitizer for $129.90, or more than $12 per bottle. Average unit price for U.S. hand sanitizers at the end of November was $2.06, according to data provider Nielsen.
Another seller on Amazon had priced four 20-count boxes of N95 masks made by 3M Co. for $580.24 plus $19.75 in shipping. An out-of-stock 20-count box of N95 masks at a Home Depot store in Evanston, Ill., was priced at $21.47.
Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the pricing of masks and hand sanitizer on its site.
Amazon has said it would remove and block items offered for sale on its site where price-gouging is suspected. Last week the company said it had removed more than one million items from its platform, including so-called cures for the illness caused by the new coronavirus.
Kayla DeShon, a nanny and mother of a 3-year-old in Highlands Ranch, Colo., said she stocked up on water, rice and beans at a Costco Wholesale Corp. store last week. She couldn't find hand sanitizer this weekend at her local Walgreens and King Soopers stores.
Ms. DeShon, 31, eventually bought the last six organic hand sanitizers from the baby section at a Target store. "I have super bad anxiety around health and I'm a germaphobe," Ms. DeShon said. "This is basically the worst thing that can happen mentally."
Raley's Supermarkets, which operates about 120 stores in Northern California, said it is working to increase the availability of hand sanitizer, tissue, disinfectants and other cleaning and hygiene products. The chain said it is in discussions with suppliers to ensure the availability of these products. A spokeswoman said Raley's hasn't experienced shortages of any foods it sells.
Chris Glushko, a 45-year-old marketing professional in Denver, went to his local Target store with his wife on Thursday to stock up on food. The couple spent about $250 on canned soup, pasta, granola bars and other dry foods to last them roughly two weeks. They also purchased over-the-counter cold medicine and a bag of dried dog food. Mr. Glushko said he didn't notice a shortage of anything except hand sanitizer on shelves.
"We're not panicked in the least," Mr. Glushko said. "We just want to be ahead of the curve."

Monday: February manufacturing purchasing managers index data will be in the spotlight, with the Caixin manufacturing PMI for China expected to show an impact from the coronavirus epidemic. Measures of factory output in the eurozone and the U.S. are also due out Monday and will be closely scrutinized for comments on the supply-chain impact of the outbreak. Economists expect the U.S. factory sector remained narrowly in expansionary territory last month.
Wednesday: Services PMI are on deck Wednesday, with data from the eurozone, the U.K. and the U.S. The Bank of Canada will also announce an interest-rate decision. The Canadian economy barely grew in the final three months of 2019 due to declines in exports and business investment, leading some economists to expect the central bank will cut interest rates -- particularly given recent disruptions in global supply chains stemming from the coronavirus epidemic.
Thursday: OPEC and its allies hold a two-day meeting in Vienna, which will be closely watched for any production cuts related to the coronavirus.
Friday: The Labor Department releases the February jobs report. The payrolls report will offer insight into how the labor market fared in the second month of the year. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast the economy added 175,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate ticked back down to a 50-year low of 3.5%. The Commerce Department will also release data on the trade deficit in January, which is seen narrowing to $46 billion from $48.88 billion in December.

Moments after getting his first career PGA Tour victory, Sungjae Im reflected on what it means.
Not for himself -- for his homeland and for those dealing with a virus that has the world on edge.
The South Korean, 21, won the Honda Classic by one stroke over Mackenzie Hughes and two over Tommy Fleetwood for his first victory in 50 tries on tour. Im made sure to speak out about the coronavirus and tell those in South Korea -- where nearly 4,000 cases have been confirmed -- he was thinking of them.
"Over in Korea right now, I know a lot of people are dealing with the coronavirus," Im said. "But I'm just glad as a Korean player that I can deliver some good news to the countrymen back home ... and make everybody proud."
Im, the PGA Tour rookie of the year last season, shot a four-under-par 66 to finish at six-under 274 at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. Hughes shot his second consecutive 66. Fleetwood, who started the day ahead by one, had a 71.
Bernhard Langer shot an eight-under 65 for a two-stroke win in the Cologuard Classic on the PGA Tour Champions. Langer, 62, finished at 18-under 201 at Tucson National for his 41st victory on the 50-and-older circuit. ... Sami Valimaki won the Oman Open by beating Brandon Stone in a playoff in the European Tour event.

ETC.
Manchester Citywins League Cup
Manchester City won the English League Cup for a third consecutive season by beating Aston Villa 2-1 at Wembley Stadium.
Sergio Aguero and Rodri scored in the first 30 minutes in London, and City held on to give manager Pep Guardiola his sixth major trophy in his fourth season.
City's Premier League trophy almost certainly is going to be surrendered to Liverpool this season, but a first Champions League title remains a possibility.
Real Madrid beat visiting Barcelona 2-0 in "El Clasico" to return to the top of the Spanish league standings. ... Jordan Morris had two second-half goals as host Seattle began its MLS Cup defense by beating Chicago 2-1.

Pandemic of lies calls for a truth sandwich

Among the many outlandish statements President Trump has made since taking office, one in particular stands out for me.
Speaking in Kansas City, Mo., in the summer of 2018, he urged the attendees of the VFW annual convention to ignore the journalism of the mainstream media.
"Just stick with us, don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news," he said. "What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening."
In other words, if you didn't hear from me or my minions, it isn't true.
Chico Marx memorably expressed a similar idea in the 1933 comedy "Duck Soup": "Who ya gonna believe - me or your own eyes?"
It's a dumbfounding notion, especially given Trump's proven propensity for lies and falsehoods. But now as a deadly disease, the coronavirus, threatens to turn into a full-blown pandemic, it's not simply bizarre in a way that can be easily shrugged off. It's not just Trump being Trump.
And it's definitely not funny. It's dangerous.
Trump and his chosen spokespeople are attempting to dramatically play down the seriousness of the coronavirus and to blame the legitimate news media for doing their jobs of informing the public.
In reporting what Trump has to say, the news media has a huge responsibility not to repeat and amplify his misleading spin - a spin that may serve his political interests but is not in the public interest.
It's not always easy, though, for mainstream journalists to put his claims in the proper context.
After all, it had always been normal to let a president have his say - to let his statements top the news while letting the fact checks follow.
That has changed somewhat during the lie-ridden Trump administration, but not nearly enough. The reflexive media urge, deep in our DNA, is still to quote the president without offering an immediate challenge.
That's why we continue to see headlines and chyrons that parrot his words directly, no matter how misleading: That the virus will disappear, that it's not inevitable that the disease will spread, that a vaccine is coming along "rapidly," that the United States is "very, very ready" to deal with whatever happens.
When journalists do push back with fact checks or with dissenting sources from the worlds of science and medicine, Trump and the administration attack the messengers. Sometimes that takes the form of disparaging tweets such as one from Wednesday in which he charged cable networks MSNBC and CNN of "panicking markets" and in which he bragged "USA in great shape!"
His most dependable allies are right there with him - accusing the mainstream news media of using virus coverage to try to take down the president.
Their logic seems to be that the drastic stock market declines in recent days are the result of media overkill, not legitimate business concerns. "What I might do to calm the markets is turn the television off for 24 hours," was acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's advice Friday to the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference.
Some months ago, I wrote about the linguist George Lakoff's prescription for handling the president's false statements and lies, an approach that's become known as the "truth sandwich." 
Rather than lead with the falsehood and then try to debunk it, Lakoff - an expert on how propaganda works - suggested flipping that formula: Lead with the truth, air the falsehood, and then follow with the fact check.
Avoid giving prominence to lies, he advises. Don't put them in headlines, leads or tweets. It is that very amplification that gives them power, even if they are proclaimed false in the next beat.
Of course, that recommendation runs in direct opposition to how news usually works. Traditionally, we have emphasized the words of top officials, and only then tempered them with fact checks.
Too often, Lakoff told me, the media "has become complicit with Trump by allowing itself to be used as an amplifier for his falsehoods and frames." And that's true even when journalists make lists of lies. It's the repetition and the prominence that does the harm.
Trump's tendency to spin out assertions untethered from reality becomes a recipe for disaster when combined with his disdain for scientists, medical experts, intelligence officials, journalists and others who deal in fact-based reality.
Add in the dangers of a disease rapidly approaching pandemic proportions, and it becomes more important than ever to emphasize truthful information over false spin.
I'm convinced that we in the media, with all our obvious faults, have learned some things about covering Trump over the past four years. Now would be an excellent time to put it into practice.

Residents are avoiding contact and stockpiling food and supplies
KIRKLAND, Wash. - One church canceled Communion on Sunday and banned handshakes and hugs. More than two dozen firefighters, and some police officers, are under quarantine. The hospital urged visitors to stay home. And Lake Washington Institute of Technology said it is shutting down for two days to disinfect the campus. 
This outdoorsy city of 90,000 just northeast of Seattle, known for its piney woods, water sports and a Google campus with a meandering bike path running through it, has become the epicenter of the U.S. response to the deadly coronavirus as it begins to spread along the West Coast. A 50-year-old man who died at a hospital here became the first U.S. death linked to the virus, and many others have been exposed to it, turning Kirkland into a test case to see how quickly authorities can contain the illness and the fear that accompanies it. 
Authorities reported a second death Sunday, a man in his 70s who died at the same hospital the day before.
"We are gathered together today amidst news that can make us anxious or fearful. I'm sure all of our hearts are thinking about that word, 'coronavirus,' " senior pastor Scott Scruggs, wearing a blue checked shirt, jeans and sneakers, said from a stage with a live band during services inside Northshore Community Church on Sunday. The crowd was thinner than usual, and Scruggs said church members were wiping door handles, discouraging touching, and urging sniffly people to watch the services from home online. "We're doing what we can and we want to invite you to do the same."
Officials in Seattle and King County confirmed four new cases of coronavirus-related illnesses on Sunday, bringing the state total to 13. 
City officials said that 25 firefighters and two police officers who were exposed to the virus at the LifeCare Center of Kirkland have shown no symptoms but are under close watch, while a county health department official said there were more than 50 residents and staff at the center who were reportedly ill with symptoms. Authorities also are worried that others - including 17 nursing students and four faculty and staff members from Lake Washington Institute of Technology - were exposed to the virus at the nursing home last week during a visit. 
Leslie Shattuck, a college spokeswoman, said she did not know if the students and faculty had been quarantined, noting that they were awaiting instructions from public health officials.
The public college decided to close its 7,000-student campus in Kirkland through Tuesday to disinfect the school out of "an abundance of caution," Shattuck said. The school also canceled a staff training session on diversity and an open house scheduled for this week.
"The health and safety of our students, faculty and staff are top of mind as we work our way through this emergency," university president Amy Morrison said in a statement.
With a quarter of the city's 100 firefighters under quarantine, Kirkland city officials scrambled to prepare amid a host of unknowns. It remains unclear how many residents have been exposed to the virus, though its spread seems inevitable. 
On Sunday, local police and fire chiefs hunkered in a basement control center amid blinking television screens and made sure that the fire department would remain fully staffed and that backup would be available from neighboring towns in case of a fire - just one firefighter remained under quarantine at Fire Station 21 while the others from the station were quarantined in their homes.
Officials also urged residents to wash their hands and stockpile enough food for several days, as they would in case of an earthquake.
Mayor Penny Sweet, who prepared homemade peanut brittle and toffee to deliver to quarantined firefighters and police officers, said the city is following the advice of public health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She said the city is working to limit exposure and that she hopes the spread will be contained.
"We're being extraordinarily cautious, but at this point in time, we are not canceling a lot of things. At the same time, if things go nuts . . . we have to be flexible," Sweet said. "For the most part, things are fairly calm. Grocery stores have been busy. People are stocking up in case it gets worse, which is wise. I'm very confident that we're doing everything that we can."
Lines formed at shopping centers across the city as residents bought paper towels, disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer amid reports of the virus spreading through parts of California, Oregon and Washington state. Some people rushed to big-box stores to stock up on medication, jars of pasta sauce and cleaning supplies. Instead of shaking hands, people waved at one another, attempting to stand a respectful six feet apart - CDC's suggested distance to avoid possible transmission.
The Costco in Kirkland opens at 10 a.m. on Sundays, but a line began forming at the door a half-hour early. 
Julie Larralde, 60, wore a mask as she stood in line. She lives close by and has been stocking up on food during the past few weeks.
"I worry more about the panic," she said. "If we didn't panic, I wouldn't be here this morning. This would not be what I would do normally."
Wentao Chen, 49, lives in nearby Bellevue. He came to Costco early to beat the crowd.
"I want to get in and out quick," he said. "I heard that the line might be long."
While Chen is worried about his parents and sister, who live in China, he says there's not much he can do. Before his wife flew their children to Northern California in early February, she asked him to buy masks there. He couldn't find any at stores nearby, so he eventually bought some online.
Others here say people are overreacting, and they went about the mundane tasks of a late-winter weekend. They pumped gas, walked their dogs and jogged amid the blossoming cherry trees, determined to enjoy the sun-splashed day ahead of a rainy forecast.
Kelley Voss, 29, and Bryce Woodland, 30, who were heading to breakfast in downtown Kirkland on Sunday, said they were not worried about coronavirus.
"I guess we haven't been that concerned because there haven't been that many cases among people who are healthy and young," Voss said. "It hasn't been worse than the flu, really. Of course, I have concern for people who aren't young and healthy."
At the Fred Meyer, a sprawling store where shoppers can buy engagement rings, clothing and groceries, shoppers perused flowers and Easter candy while Girl Scouts hawked cookies at the entrance. 
One couple stared at the empty shelves where the anti-bacterial wipes and lotions normally sit. Their two sons, ages 10 and 8, decided to stay home because they said they were afraid of catching the virus.
"There's nothing left," said Erika Vences, 27, a house cleaner from Mexico, standing with her partner, Manuel Cruz, 42, a construction worker. They said they are trying to ward off the virus here while fielding phone calls from worried relatives back home in Aguascalientes. "We're trying to keep the house even cleaner than usual."
The lobby and cafeteria were empty at a local health center on Sunday morning, though a couple of men walked past a sign on a large easel that said: "To help ensure the health and safety of our patients, staff and community, we are discouraging visitors from coming to the EvergreenHealth Kirkland Campus."
One man shrugged and said he was going to visit his father, who just had surgery. An elderly man in a baseball cap waved and walked in, saying, "I don't care." 
City Manager Kurt Triplett said come Monday, Kirkland residents will see some new signs encouraging elbow bumps or waves.
"We all need to adjust to this as the new normal," Triplett said. "We may be seeing the end of the handshake."
But others said the spread of coronavirus, like the flu, is inevitable. A school nurse said it will be difficult to stop small children from coughing on one another. At City Hall, some people touched one another or shook hands. 
At Northshore Community Church, parishioners couldn't stop themselves from hugging a man who recently returned after brain surgery.
As King County Sheriff's Deputy David Easterly supervised traffic in the church's parking lot, he said he felt lucky to be in a country where the response to the disease has been swift and transparent. He lives near the Mill Creek area, where a high school student fell ill last week, but he said the virus felt "well-contained so far." 
"I don't go around licking doorknobs and such," he said with a laugh. "I'm not really worried."

In the week ahead, all eyes will be on the U.S. jobs report for February, as well as global manufacturing data out Monday. Elsewhere, the Bank of Canada will announce a rate decision Wednesday.
Monday: February manufacturing purchasing managers index data will be in the spotlight, with the Caixin manufacturing PMI for China expected to show an impact from the coronavirus epidemic. Measures of factory output in the eurozone and the U.S. are also due out Monday and will be closely scrutinized for comments on the supply-chain impact of the recent outbreak. Economists expect the U.S. factory sector remained narrowly in expansionary territory last month.
Wednesday: Services PMI are on deck Wednesday, with data from the eurozone, the U.K. and the U.S. The Bank of Canada will also announce an interest-rate decision. The Canadian economy barely grew in the final three months of 2019 due to declines in exports and business investment, leading some economists to expect the central bank will cut interest rates—particularly given recent disruptions in global supply chains stemming from the coronavirus epidemic.
Thursday: The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies hold a two-day meeting in Vienna, which will be closely eyed for any output cuts related to coronavirus.
Friday: The Labor Department releases the February jobs report. The payrolls report will offer insight into how the labor market fared in the second month of the year. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast the economy added 175,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate ticked back down to a 50-year low of 3.5%, an indication the labor market remains strong. By comparison, in January, U.S. employers added jobs 225,000 new jobs and the unemployment rate was 3.6%.
The Commerce Department will also release data on the trade deficit in January, which is seen narrowing to $46 billion from $48.88 billion in December.

Wall Street Prepares for Another Unruly Week; Even those on trading desks have struggled to keep pace with the market tumult

Global investors are bracing for another hair-raising ride, after a week of frantic and at times disorderly trading.
The Dow industrials have dropped seven straight days entering trading Monday, posting their steepest weekly decline since the financial crisis. Their 14% pullback since Feb. 12 places the longest-ever U.S. stock rally in jeopardy of falling into a "bear market," marking a 20% decline from a recent high.
The rout has been by the book to some extent. A roaring rally in government bonds has taken the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury to a record low of 1.127% . The markets for oil and copper, whose prices reflect in part global economic expectations, have fallen sharply .
But investors have been gobsmacked by unexpected developments elsewhere. Gold raced through early 2020 to its highest level in seven years , before dropping 4.6% Friday in its sharpest drop since 2013. High-yield bond funds posted their largest-ever outflow by one measure this past week. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index surged late Friday to close higher for the first time since its record close on Feb. 19, while the Dow and S&P 500 both declined.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Are you considering buying the dip? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
Adding to investors' worries, weekend data from China showed the country's economy has taken even more of a hit from the epidemic than some had anticipated. Sentiment among manufacturers' purchasing managers, as well as an index tracking purchasing plans in services industries, both fell to a record low in February.
The market tumult has left Wall Street scrambling. Fixed-income traders at JP Morgan Chase &Co. and trading teams at Barclays PLC met late in the week, focusing on preparing for further declines in stocks and commodities. A Federal Reserve statement Friday afternoon promising appropriate action wasn't enough to quell nerves on many trading desks. Even those who counsel patience are for now expecting a period of intense volatility.

"When you are getting new information by the minute or by the hour, that creates anxiety in markets," said Joe Amato, president and chief investment officer of equities at Neuberger Berman Group LLC. "People don't want to take risk."
The turmoil is increasing trading activity among investors in retirement funds. Alight Solutions, which tracks 401(k) trading activity among investors at large employers, said trading volumes on Thursday were 11.4 times higher than normal. Since 2008, there have only been two other days when trading volumes exceeded 11 times the historical average, says the company.
The violent downdraft in stocks has created an acute need for cash. Declines in gold and other areas of the market often associated with stability, like the shares of utilities firms, show that investors are being forced to raise cash to make up for losses from stocks, some traders said—including margin calls to investors who had used stocks as collateral to buy other securities. With the value of those positions shrinking substantially, banks can demand repayment, triggering forced sales of unrelated assets.
"You have a tremendous amount of people who needed cash," said George Gero, managing director at RBC Wealth Management. "There is no haven at the moment with the exception of Treasurys."
A Bank of America survey of fund managers in February showed investors' positioning in cash at the lowest levels since March 2013.
Friday capped one of the worst two-week spans for high-yield credit since the financial crisis, marking the end of a long spell of largely placid trading. Analysts say moves haven't been this violent since 2011, citing jumps in credit-default swap indexes and outflows from high-yield funds.
The average bid for S&P Global Market Intelligence's LCD 15-bond sample of high-yield issues tumbled 2.47 percentage points over the past week, wiping out all 2020 gains on Thursday. Markit's high-yield CDX index dropped nearly 5 points in two weeks, the steepest decline for any comparable period since 2011.
The action is evidence that the rapid evolution of coronavirus from an epidemic to what appears to be a pandemic has paralyzed Wall Street, some investors say, because there are too many unanswered questions .
"It's a brand new thing," said Chris Stanton, chief investment officer at Sunrise Capital Partners LLC, a California-based quantitative fund. "If the next headline says Disney is shutting its theme parks, we will start seeing moves like 2008."
For now, many portfolio managers and investors believe the storm will pass, leaving intact a bull market that started in 2009 and has pushed the Dow up some 300%. Some took heart at the frantic late-afternoon rally that narrowed Friday's losses, while others said they believe the selling is likely to prove overdone .
"I still think we're in a secular bull market," said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments.
Yet even those who believe the coronavirus scare will blow over are bracing for additional volatility as investors struggle to discern the true impact of the illness on global markets and economies.
Ms. Tengler holds some options to hedge against stock declines. The move wasn't even primarily prompted by worries about the coronavirus. Months before, she had already had a feeling that stocks were due for a pullback, given the extent to which they had risen despite a lackluster year of earnings in 2019 and muted growth.
She wasn't sure what the trigger for the decline would be. But she believed it was coming nevertheless. The options have more than tripled in value, so Ms. Tengler plans on selling some of them to take in a profit.
Some of her clients haven't been as farsighted. She said she got a text from a client as the market selloff picked up steam last week.
"Wow, you were right," the client said. "I wish I had hedged."

China locks down tens of millions in their homes to slow the march of a deadly virus -- but furnishes scant information about the mercurial spread of a disease that has spooked the world.
South Korea and Singapore opt to track patients' movements in granular detail, favoring radical transparency over privacy. In Italy and Iran, politicians trade blame over rapidly growing outbreaks that are seeping across unstable regions, making a global pandemic seemingly inevitable. Infections appear in Mexico. Then Nigeria.
As the world unites in resolve to battle one deadly virus -- now known as COVID-19 -- it is doing so with as many as 195 separate playbooks, each country calibrating its emergency measures to suit domestic and international politics, local capacity, cultural norms and other considerations that have little to do with public health.
The result is a global response that can appear uneven, inchoate and at times dangerous, with neighboring countries adopting different strategies to similar threats across a closely connected planet.
"Unfortunately we are only as prepared as our weakest link," said Lawrence O. Gostin, a global health professor at Georgetown Law School. "We are seeing that clusters of cases in one country can quickly move regionally and globally. No one is safe unless we are all safe."
Responses to recent outbreaks have been hindered, Gostin said, by a range of factors: weak health systems, insufficient testing equipment and medical professionals, authoritarian leaders who restrict the flow of information, political instability and violence, and the limitations of the World Health Organization, which is loath to criticize the very governments it relies upon for funding.
In years past, countries like the U.S. might have played a leading role in spearheading a global response. But President Trump for weeks has minimized the threat of the virus and has been focused largely on the impact on markets, even as the virus began transmitting on U.S. soil in the middle of a divisive election year.
The strengths and shortcomings of governments and institutions have been on full display in recent days, as the number of coronavirus infections soared past 86,000 in more than 50 countries. Nearly 3,000 have died, the vast majority in China.
New cases were reported last week in Brazil and Nigeria, increasingly signaling that the virus will reach all corners of the world and that the effort to stay ahead of it will be prolonged. The novel virus sends shudders daily across the planet, canceling concerts and sporting events, and raising questions over sealed borders, quarantines, the viability of face masks and test kits, the long-term consequences on financial markets and what happens if the disease reaches deeper into Africa.
"My biggest concern is while this is being artificially held back, are countries taking advantage of this time?" said Dale Fisher, a Singapore-based physician and chairman of the WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. "China can't stay closed forever, and this outbreak, it already has brought cities to their knees, brought countries to social and commercial standstill."
From being slow to disclose the severity of the virus when it first emerged in December in the animal markets of the central city of Wuhan, China is now winning praise for locking down 100 million people in Hubei province -- an unprecedented cordon sanitaire that appears to have slowed the spread of the virus domestically.
For the first time last week, the number of infections reported in a single day was greater outside China than inside.
"What China has done over the past month is astonishing -- there are very few countries that could have pulled that off," said Tom Frieden, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A recent WHO mission to China lavished praise on the government's measures. That same organization credited Beijing's response even as the nation's leaders were not forthcoming about the extent of the disease two months ago. Questions continue to linger about China's transparency over the infections it records.
Chinese officials have disclosed only limited information about infections among front-line healthcare workers, when infected people first began to show symptoms and the total number of people it has tested -- all of which could help determine how the disease spreads.
"The lack of that information makes it harder for China and the world to do everything possible to limit the impact of the virus," Frieden said.
There is also the question of whether the draconian measures taken by Chinese authorities can be replicated elsewhere in the world -- especially in liberal democracies.
Governments in two new epicenters, Iran and Italy, were scrambling to get a handle on outbreaks that started with travelers arriving from China.
Iran's theocracy at first downplayed the threat, perhaps to curry favor with China -- an important trading partner -- and to avoid startling a population already beaten down by years of fiscal mismanagement and U.S. economic sanctions. Some analysts said Iran was also trying to keep up turnout for last month's legislative elections, a quasi-democratic exercise that helps the ruling clerics maintain a veneer of legitimacy.
"You have a social crisis and an economic crisis and now a public health crisis layered on top of one another, and it presents complicated trade-offs for the Iranian government," said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, founder of Bourse &Bazaar, a publication that tracks Iran's economy. "And we are seeing a failure to judge those trade-offs wisely."
Iran has now reported 593 cases -- including the infection of its deputy health minister -- and 43 deaths. The unusually high ratio of deaths to known cases has led experts to extrapolate the country may have thousands of undetected infections. Iran is believed to be the source for infections in a half-dozen regional countries, including Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan, a prospect that has the virus colliding with conflict zones.
Italy was quick to quarantine two Chinese tourists with coronavirus in Rome in late January, and was the first European country to stop direct flights from China, but has nevertheless been hit by the biggest outbreak in Europe.
Cases began rapidly multiplying in towns in northern Italy and spread to other parts of the country, infecting more than 1,120 and killing 29 as of Saturday, slipping across open borders to other European nations.
The surge of infections began with one man who spent two days at a hospital before his case was detected, infecting patients and doctors. Authorities have been swift to point the blame elsewhere; Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte claimed the hospital didn't follow protocol, but the local health chief for the region of Lombardy said the European Union could have been at fault.
"I believe if Europe had established a quarantine immediately for all people coming from China, Europe would not be having these problems now," Giulio Gallera, the health chief, said.
In South Korea and Japan, allegations were mounting that the governments had put geopolitics ahead of the population's safety early in their responses, in the interest of preserving relations with China.
Japan's handling of the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked off its shore proved an early example of a bungled response. Critics charged that the government allowed the virus to fester on board with inadequate measures to prevent infections.
Some questioned whether the government made the decision to keep some 3,700 passengers and crew on board to keep the cases from being counted among its infections in the lead-up to the Summer Olympics in Tokyo. After more than 600 infections and two deaths, Japan allowed passengers to disembark and disperse via public transit when there was still danger of transmission.
The loss in faith in the government's response is particularly keen because Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came into office promising competence after the nuclear disaster of 2011, said Kenneth Mori McElwain, a political science professor at the University of Tokyo.
"Some people believe the Abe government more or less caved to Chinese pressure, and that dealt a blow to the perception of competence," he said.
In South Korea, more than 1.3 million signed a petition calling for the impeachment of President Moon Jae-in, criticizing the government's reluctance to impose swift travel restrictions from China and on Chinese nationals.
"The more we observe his handling of this situation, it feels like we're watching the president of China, not of the Republic of Korea," the petition read.
The upheaval was in spite of aggressive and proactive measures taken by the government to track down every contact with an infected person, test them for the virus and publicize that information. South Korea nonetheless saw the ranks of the infected skyrocket to more than 3,500 last week, by far the largest cluster outside China.
Elsewhere in Asia, governments are facing questions over a lack of infections. Cambodia and Indonesia have reported one and zero infections respectively, despite having received large numbers of travelers from China in January. Indonesia had daily direct flights from Wuhan, the epicenter, until authorities suspended the flights Jan. 24.
To experts, the low figures suggest that the virus is spreading undetected.
"Indonesia is a textbook example of a country that is likely to have a spread that is unrecognized," Frieden said.
The risk of the disease taking off across Southeast Asia is high, experts said, due to inadequate health facilities and people packed closely together in crowded cities. It's also not clear that officials are taking the threat seriously: Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen greeted untested passengers disembarking from a cruise ship from Hong Kong with handshakes and hugs, while Indonesia's health minister said the country's lack of infections was "because of our prayers."
Faith does not seem to be slowing the virus. Nigeria's first case Friday marked COVID-19's arrival in sub-Saharan Africa, where health systems already struggle to cope with malaria and yellow fever.
The WHO is rushing test kits to the continent's hospitals, some of which developed experience testing for infectious diseases during the Ebola outbreak. But the coronavirus presents a more difficult challenge, experts said, because it can be transmitted even by people who fail to show symptoms.
"If COVID-19 reaches sub-Saharan Africa" in large numbers, Gostin said, "it would be our worst nightmare."

Galen Rupp, Aliphine Tuliamuk and America's other top distance runners have claimed their spots on the U.S. Olympic marathon team.
That's only half the battle. Now they have to wait to see if the Tokyo Games will be held.
Rupp reclaimed his status as the nation's top distance runner Saturday, winning his second straight U.S. marathon trials and earning a spot for an Olympics shadowed by a global virus.
"I've always been someone who says you can control what you can control," Rupp said, adding the impact of the coronavirus on the Olympics is "a decision that's way above myself.
"I'll let the proper authorities or governing bodies deal with that when it comes. Right now I think all of us are just real excited to make the team and be representing Team USA."
Rupp finished almost 43 seconds ahead of Jacob Riley. Abdi Abdirahman also earned a spot on the U.S. team by finishing third.
Tuliamuk edged Molly Seidel by seven seconds in the closest women's finish in the trials. Seidel became the first woman to make the U.S. Olympics team while running in her first marathon. Sally Kipyego was third.

Betting on aid from central banks

Investors aren't buying the idea that central banks' wait-and-see approach to the coronavirus will last. They're betting on interest rate cuts that could start within months.
Money markets now see three Federal Reserve reductions this year -- starting in March -- and one by the European Central Bank in July. The Bank of England will cut in May, according to a similar metric.
The ECB is in a tougher position than other central banks, with limited ammunition if the situation worsens, and top officials including President Christine Lagarde have signaled that more time is needed to weigh the effects of the outbreak.
But even for those with more space, such as the Fed, there are doubts that monetary policy response will prove effective, as the virus-induced shock is concentrated on the supply side of the economy.
"The problem with doing monetary stimulus is that it will have limited impact on the effects of the virus," said Jens Peter Sorensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen. "The COVID- 19 virus is keeping people from work, the supply chain is disrupted and tourists are not going to Italy. Monetary policy can do very little."
So far, the view among central bankers across the world is it's too early to assess what the economic damage will be.
Bank of Korea Gov. Lee Ju-yeol said the appropriate response at this stage was targeted support for the companies most affected by the biggest virus outbreak outside China, not a wider-reaching rate reduction.
Bank of England's outgoing governor, Mark Carney, warned that the coronavirus could result in an economic growth downgrade for Britain, Sky News reported.
The governor of the Bank of France, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, said that the virus is a supply shock and monetary policy may not be the right response, and ECB Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel said they need more clarity about the implications of the virus, echoing Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida's statement this week.
"They would prefer not to rush to judgment and stay on hold for now," Roberto Perli, a partner at Cornerstone Macro, said of the Fed. The likely outcome is "they don't cut in March but issue a statement that makes it clear they are ready to act if the situation deteriorates."
Meanwhile, investors are buying up haven investments, sending yields on U.S. Treasurys to record lows and putting the dollar on course for its best month since July. And volatility has returned to the currency market, with demand for protection against price swings in the euro jumping.
Although policy makers don't want to rush, there's a growing view that what was meant to be a year of central banks on hold will instead see monetary stimulus in some of the world's biggest economies.
Even if the situation improves later this year, the hit in the first half could be severe. Credit Suisse Group on Thursday cut its 2020 global growth projection to 2.2% from 2.6%, and its euro-area outlook to just 0.5%. "There'll be a lot of damage done on the way down before we get back up," said Neville Hill, the bank's chief European economist.
If the major central banks do hold fire, it would be one of the rare times since the financial crisis that they haven't capitulated to money market sentiment.
Although policymakers probably won't admit to being out of options, they've been keen to keep the pressure on governments to be the first responders if the recovery gets cut short.
The Fed is one of the few central banks with high enough rates that cuts could be meaningful, but the U.S. economy remains relatively strong. The ECB, by comparison, already has interest rates well below zero, and its stimulus policies have struggled to lift growth. Its track record of sensitivity to investors' rate expectations makes the recent tilt toward predictions of a cut stand out.

Re "Protected cactuses felled to construct border wall," Feb. 27
The news of the taking down of protected saguaro cacti in Arizona for the ultimately ineffective U.S.-Mexico border fence (it's not a wall) touted by President Trump is particularly disheartening.
It brings to mind last year during the government shutdown (largely over the same stupid idea -- a wall) when marauders damaged trees at our beloved Joshua Tree National Park.
When will we demand that our leaders learn important lessons? People, we have Tuesday, and we have Nov. 3. Vote for the natural environment like your life depends on it, because it does.
Scott Hamre
Cherry Valley, Calif.
::
Just who does President Trump think he is with the construction of his border wall, which has still not been approved by Congress, causing the destruction of mighty saguaro plants in the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument?
The destruction of any organ pipe cactus, which is protected, is a crime. Trump, who wrote and signed the orders to build the wall, should face the same punishment that you and I would if we were to destroy these specimens.
I travel through the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument often when visiting Mexico, and the namesake cacti are a sight to behold. It takes about 100 years for one to grow an arm.
I doubt Trump has ever been in the park, let alone seen one of these cacti up close.

What hath Bernie wrought?
Re "Young voters go all-in for Sanders," Feb. 27
We would not be in the constitutional and political mess we are in today if not for Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 because of then-FBI Director James B. Comey and her former primary opponent Sanders, not because she didn't visit a few states that President Trump ended up winning. What is a mystery to me is why the media or any of his opponents have not attacked him on his past record in this regard.
His Senate designation is as an independent, not as a Democrat. He has proven to be an uncooperative team player.
It is important that the Democrats cohere around the nominee, yet Sanders might just pull out the same playbook he did back in 2016 if he doesn't get the nomination.
We do not need another backward-looking runaway ego sitting in the White House.
Nancy Zaman
Beverly Hills
::
Apparently, we are supposed to be worried that nominating Sanders will mean certain defeat by Trump. And, to avoid this, we are supposed to vote for any moderate Democrat who might have the chance of defeating him in California.
But wait, didn't the Democratic Party nominate a moderate in 2016?
Maybe, just maybe, the Democratic Party should support the candidate that is generating the largest grass-roots support among committed activists who are working day and night on his campaign. Maybe, just maybe, if the Democratic Party were to support the candidate that is talking about the economic issues facing the vast majority of Americans, we could easily defeat that alleged populist Trump.
Just think: We could overwhelmingly win the election. Or we could just support anyone but Sanders and get four more years of Trump.
By the way, we are not millennials. We are in our 60s and are working tirelessly to ensure a Sanders victory and a Green New Deal in California.

Sanders promises to spend $2.5 trillion on housing over the next 10 years. He promises aid to homeless people and construction of new housing, among other things.
This is in addition to free college and free medical care. Whoopie.
I am 85 years old. Sanders is 78. Neither of us will be around much longer, but young voters will still be paying for this "free stuff" when they are our age.

Why school measures fail
Re "Audit: Lottery owes millions to state schools," Feb. 26
According to the state auditor, the California Lottery has been holding back funding from public schools, including $36 million in 2018. Last year, the Los Angeles Unified School District asked voters to pass a parcel tax to cover its increased expenses. That initiative failed, so the district is devising another funding measure that it hopes voters will approve.
Taxpayers and lottery players have often wondered why the school system always needs more money when the people of this state are spending hundreds of millions of dollars playing the lottery knowing that a percentage of these funds will go to schools.
If our schools really need the additional funding, which I believe they do, they should draft a proposal to increase their proportion of lottery revenue. Don't try to ask the taxpayers for more money -- it won't work.
In addition, maybe the school districts need to collectively hire an outside accounting agency to watch over the funding and ensure that our students are receiving what they are legally due.
Glen Kacena
Westchester
::
In 1984, I voted yes on the ballot measure to create the California Lottery. I thought it was a great idea to set aside 34% of the sales revenue for schools, creating a steady stream of income that we would not have to vote on again and again.
Capping administrative expenses at 16% was a sound decision.
Now, I am appalled to read that in 2010, the state Legislature took it upon itself to change how the California Lottery determined its obligation to schools. How can lawmakers arbitrarily change a ballot measure that took a statewide vote to pass?
Now, we are being asked to pass Proposition 13 because our schools need more money. I say vote no on this.
Your article states that the lottery has provided $6.7 billion to public education over the last four years. What happened to all that money?

A fall guy for coronavirus
Re "The politics of coronavirus," Feb. 28
Sure, naming Vice President Mike Pence, a science-disdaining evangelical Christian, to coordinate our country's response to the looming coronavirus epidemic may seem like yet another inapt Trumpian appointment. But giving Pence something to do might turn out to be a win-win for Trump.
If the virus' spread somehow is thwarted under Pence's direction, Trump can cite this stunning success all the way to election day. If an epidemic ensues, Trump can tell Pence he's fired and replace him with a more appealing running mate.
Waiting in the wings for such an exigency is Nikki Haley; as a former ambassador to the United Nations, state legislator and governor, she's compiled a sterling resume. With Haley on the ticket, Trump can hope to draw in millions of women who otherwise would vote for a mixed-gender Democratic ticket.
Democrats have every reason to pray that Pence doesn't falter in his epidemic-fighting role.
Edward Alston
Santa Maria
::
The president, in order to manage the spin on the COVID-19 virus and make sure to maintain the very best of images, has decided that any medical information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meant for American citizens must first get the blessing of the vice president, who has no medical training.
There's a name for this kind of governance -- it's called "dictatorship."

Media filters
Re "YouTube and conservatives," editorial, Feb. 27
I agree that conservative ideas have practically no place in public discourse unless screened by responsible progressive media.
The Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN and NBC have done a great job filtering those ideas to mitigate against their nefarious influence on the populace. Keep up the good work.

The stock market fell for the seventh straight day Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average losing 357 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 25,409. Only by staging a late rally in the final 15 minutes of trading was the Dow able to avert its third daily loss this week of more than 1,000 points.
The sustained sell-off, driven by fears of global economic damage from the spreading coronavirus, prompted both the Federal Reserve and the White House to hunt for possible remedies, eyeing tools they have used during past crises to calm the public.
The traditional tactics, however, may not work against a financial panic driven by a global health scare that lacks precedent or antidote.
A sign of the crisis-fighting difficulties ahead came in the afternoon, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell issued an unusual statement vowing to "act as appropriate" to defend the U.S. economy from the outbreak. Many analysts interpreted the statement as a pledge to cut interest rates, a signal that often heartens investors. But this time, the sell-off continued.
After a week that shaved more than $4 trillion from global stock values, Powell's effort was among a series of steps meant to reassure frazzled investors. Nothing, so far, appears to be working.
"The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong," Powell said. "However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook. We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."
Evercore ISI, an investment firm, told clients Friday that it now expects the Fed to cut rates by a half-percentage point at its mid-March meeting, something few expected just one week ago. 
Meanwhile, White House officials held meetings of their own Friday, considering potential tax-cut packages that they hope might boost consumer confidence. This comes after several days of unsuccessful efforts by President Trump and his economic team to cajole people to buy stocks and drive prices higher.
The Fed and White House deliberations illustrate how policymakers are searching for ways to arrest the sudden sell-off, which some analysts say raises the possibility of a recession later this year.
Typically, the Fed responds to economic trouble by lowering interest rates to make credit easier to obtain. It also can offer loans to banks or buy large quantities of U.S. Treasury securities, effectively adding money to the financial system and making it easier for some corporate borrowers to get cash. The White House and Congress, meanwhile, can approve new spending or tax cuts to flood the economy with money.
But the best remedy for the coronavirus - which has sickened more than 83,000 people worldwide and killed nearly 3,000 - could lie beyond Washington's immediate powers.
"Central banks don't make vaccines," said David Kotok, chairman of Cumberland Advisors.
The renewed selling intensified calls for the Fed to rescue the economy from an unforeseen shock. The medical emergency already has disrupted global production networks, curtailed air travel and hobbled economies in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. With medical experts urging Americans to prepare for serious disruptions in their daily lives, pleas for early action are coming from Wall Street and some former members of the Fed's rate-setting committee.
"The Fed can't fix broken supply chains or calm concerns about health and safety. But the Fed can ensure that liquidity conditions remain supportive, so firms can get funding through the disruption. It can also provide support to financial markets," said Nathan Sheets, chief economist for PGIM Fixed Income. "More generally, the message that the Fed is attentive and 'on the case' has tended to help soothe the economy and the markets during past episodes."
By Friday, surveys of investors showed there was a nearly unanimous belief that the Fed would cut rates by at least a quarter-percentage-point at its March 17-18 meeting. That represents a sharp and sudden change from one week ago, when just 11 percent expected Fed action, according to the CME Group.
The shift comes as Capital Economics told clients that the continued spread of the disease in the United States, which has seen roughly 60 cases so far, "could be enough to tip the economy into a mild recession."
It's uncertain, though, how effective cutting interest rates might be. Economists call an episode like the epidemic or the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks an "exogenous shock," meaning an unpredictable development that arises from outside the economy or financial system yet has significant economic consequences.
The Fed normally acts only after assessing voluminous data on business and consumer activity, using sophisticated computer models that forecast the future by comparing current conditions to what's happened in the past. There is no recent precedent for the coronavirus outbreak for the Fed to use in its models.
Recessions can occur after the Fed has begun raising interest rates to head off incipient inflation, or after warning signs such as widespread layoffs or falling equipment orders. As the economy gradually deteriorates, the Fed can cut rates to encourage more spending. The White House and lawmakers, meanwhile, often support more spending or tax cuts to boost the economy. 
The coronavirus, which first emerged in China and has now spread to countries including South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran, Brazil and the United States, poses a unique challenge. In this case, the virus materialized with no warning and, after initially appearing to be confined to China, swept into roughly 60 countries.
Trump, who has been criticized for a delayed and uncertain response to the crisis, so far has given no hint of plans for any economic stimulus, but his aides are looking at a range of options.
China stands as a cautionary tale. The Chinese government's aggressive measures to fight the crisis, including imposing quarantines over an area that is home to perhaps 60 million people, chilled both supply and demand.
China's virus-fighting campaign prevented employees from leaving their homes and working on assembly lines, thus depressing the supply of goods. And it kept people from patronizing restaurants, movies or retail stores, thereby cutting demand.
If the United States suffers a serious outbreak and people stay home, fearing possible contagion, cutting interest rates would probably do little to persuade them to return to work or go out to shop or dine. "This is a very tough one for the Fed to deal with," said Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research.
The Fed has a long history of fighting financial and economic downturns, including the 1987 stock market plunge known as Black Monday and the Russian debt default more than a decade later. In 2008, after the collapse of the housing bubble, the Fed dropped interest rates to zero and held them there for years in a bid to resuscitate the U.S. economy.
The Fed moved quickly in the wake of 9/11 to try to limit the economic fallout. Six days later, with financial markets closed and smoke still curling from the World Trade Center rubble, then-Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan cut the benchmark U.S. lending rate by half a percentage point. The central bank also pumped $102 billion into the financial system to grease the gears of the economy and ease an anticipated slowdown, according to a subsequent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
Until Friday, Fed officials had been cautious in their public comments. Richard Clarida, the Fed's vice chairman, said earlier this week that the upheaval in China could reverberate through the global economy. "But it is still too soon to even speculate about either the size or the persistence of these effects, or whether they will lead to a material change in the outlook," he said in a speech to an economists conference in Washington.
For the past three years, the Fed has helped investors shrug off Trump's serial trade wars, cutting interest rates three times last year as inflation remained low.
Between Election Day in 2016 and Feb. 12 of this year, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 61 percent. In four days this week, it surrendered one-third of that gain as investors puzzled over what the virus will mean for corporate earnings.
By itself, this week's historic stock market meltdown - erasing nearly two years' worth of gains and incurring the fastest 10-plus-percent drop in history - highlights the current peril.
Economists are struggling to assess the extent of the calamity amid conflicting information about the virulence of the illness, the likely public reaction if it spreads in the United States and the potential response from the Fed or the Trump administration. To some, the profound uncertainty recalls the financial crash that hit the United States and Europe more than a decade ago.
"Forecasting in this environment feels eerily reminiscent of the crises - the ground keeps shifting beneath me as I try to gain my footing," Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, tweeted Thursday.
The cloudy outlook shows no signs of clearing anytime soon. On Friday, Fitch Solutions, a risk analysis firm, said it was revising down its forecasts for several European economies, including Germany, after already having lowered its Asian estimates.
One day earlier, Fitch said South Korea would grow by just 1.7 percent this year, down from its 2.2 percent original forecast. And that estimate could go lower, the firm said, citing the risk that "the outbreak will not be controlled by June."

I placed the origin of the zombie apocalypse there for a reason, says novelist 
In my zombie apocalypse novel, cases of a mysterious new disease start showing up somewhere in China. The government responds by suppressing news of the infection, threatening several doctors who try to sound the alarm. That coverup allows the virus to spread throughout the country, and then beyond its borders to the rest of the world. 
Sound familiar?
I'd chosen China as ground zero for my 2006 novel, "World War Z," for a reason. When I was thinking up an origin story for my fictional pandemic, it wasn't enough to choose a country with a massive population or a rapidly modernizing transportation network. I needed an authoritarian regime with strong control over the press. Smothering public awareness would give my plague time to spread, first among the local population, then into other nations. By the time the rest of the world figured out what was going on, it would be too late. The genie would be out of the bottle, and our species would be fighting for its life.
But after it was first published in the United States, my book was banned in China - or, to be completely accurate, my would-be collaborators overseas asked me to remove all chapters about China because of their "politically sensitive material." They told me that my criticism of the government would make the authorities "jumpy." Putting out the book, complete and unaltered, could "destroy a publishing company." Someone suggested either changing China's name to that of a fictional country or else publishing the offensive chapters separately online. I'm not sure how that would have worked, exactly - maybe they'd be hosted on a server outside China, or maybe it was just a fantasy to placate me - but either way, I was told that this was the best we could do.
I refused. Having an open society, where the government operates transparently and information circulates freely, is the bedrock of public health. Censoring those chapters would play into the very dynamics that endanger citizens. Even with the best of intentions, a government that operates secretively and without accountability is ill-equipped to contain an epidemic. Lacking trust in the authorities, or dependable sources of knowledge about how to protect themselves - whether from infection or from abuses of power - citizens are left more vulnerable to both.
As much as I'd like to take creative credit for coming up with this scenario in my book, the one that inadvertently foreshadowed today's crisis, I didn't: I based the spread of my virus on the real-life spread of SARS. Cases emerged in China in late 2002, but for months, the Chinese government did not warn the public about the new and deadly pathogen. Authorities forbade newspapers from reporting on it , undercounted cases and were slow to share information with the World Health Organization. By the end of the outbreak in July 2003, the pathogen had shown up halfway around the world, infecting 8,000 people and killing 774 .
As of this writing, a new strain of coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people , and 2,770 have died - and it looks like we're just getting started. Some have praised what China learned from SARS: It established a nationwide system for hospitals and clinics to report outbreaks, for example, and officials in China have issued public statements emphasizing the need for greater transparency, as well as its rapid response to this new epidemic. But that centralized power also helped enable the outbreak. 
There might not have been a need for rapid hospital construction and mobilization if the authorities hadn't played down the severity of the coronavirus and silenced early whistleblowers like Li Wenliang, a doctor in Wuhan who tried to share news about the new virus. His posts were censored, and the police forced him to sign a letter stating that he'd made "false comments ." That's not so different from what happened to my fictional first responder in "World War Z," Kwang Jingshu: He was gagged by those in power. Unlike Kwang, however, Li eventually died of the disease he tried so hard to stop. His death sparked an online outcry among outraged Chinese citizens, who called for freedom of speech. They were also silenced, their posts removed and hashtags deleted. In recent weeks, state-run media has been instructed to cover only positive stories about the relief efforts, and Internet platforms have been more vigilant about removing articles critical of the government. 
How can we trust any government that values control more than public safety? Of all the countries I write about in "World War Z," the most mysterious is North Korea. In my book, the entire population disappears underground. They might all be safe. They might all be undead. We don't know. In the real world, Kim Jong Un has claimed that there are no coronavirus cases in North Korea. Is that true? We don't know. Meanwhile, Iran has reported the largest number of deaths from the virus outside China. Its mortality rate, 8.7 percent, is so much higher than in other countries that critics have questioned whether the number of infections has been underreported or whether the government has suppressed information about the public health crisis.
In the United States, we have a free and open society that lets us protect ourselves. But that freedom doesn't mean freedom from responsibility. In "World War Z," the zombie plague infects America because Americans are too distracted by greed , apathy , gullibility ; they reject science and willfully embrace an incompetent president. Does that sound familiar? On his trip to India this past week, President Trump called the coronavirus "a problem that's going to go away," and at a news conference back in Washington, he claimed that "the risk to the American people remains very low." The good news is that he's not the only one with a voice. We can turn to more qualified sources, like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which warns that "disruption to everyday life may be severe." But whose word will we heed? In China, it's difficult for citizens to access the truth. In America, we might not care. 
I don't want my book to predict things to come. When the disease really hits the United States - and it will , according to the CDC - we all need to do our part. When the medical community tells us how to protect ourselves , we need to listen. When civil servants tell us what it will cost to strengthen our institutions , we need to pay up. Lastly, when we hear our fellow citizens surrendering to rumors, gossip or any unscientific fearmongering , we need to push back as if they were coughing in our face.
I was prevented from publishing my book in China because the government did not want to confront its own flaws, even when heavily fictionalized. But if we admit ours now, and work together to correct them, we can ensure that World War Z remains firmly in the realm of fiction.

President Trump sought to assure his supporters Saturday that the coronavirus is under control after earlier confirming the first U.S. death attributed to the infection and boasted of the country's great economic comeback after Wall Street's worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. 
Rallying conservatives eights months before the election, Trump mocked the height of Democratic candidate and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, crouching at the lectern for dramatic effect, called Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) a "lowlife" for his vote to convict the president on an article of impeachment and described Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as a "crazy professor."
Against the backdrop of a growing global virus and the South Carolina Democratic primary, Trump delivered a 90-minute speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in which he crowed about his political success in 2016, lashed out at his preferred targets - Democrats and the news media - and polled the audience on which of his rivals would be easier to beat in November. 
The response suggested the answer was Sanders.
Trump warned of "far-left radicals" who will "indoctrinate our children . . . impose a fanatical code of political correctness, bombard our citizens with fake news propaganda and implement policies that would turn America very quickly into a large-scale Venezuela." 
He called the House Democrats "lunatics," railed against illegal immigration and complained about losing the distinction as Time magazine's person of the year to the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg. 
Trump sneered at Democrats for questioning the job he's doing on the threat of the spreading novel coronavirus. Trump was criticized over remarks he'd made during a political rally in South Carolina on Friday night calling the virus the Democrats' "new hoax," likening it to the Russia investigation and the impeachment inquiry and trial. 
Trump said Saturday during a White House news conference that he wasn't calling the virus a hoax, but rather the Democrats' accusations that he's mismanaging it. 
"Everything is under control," Trump told the CPAC crowd, falsely stating that it was the Democrats who "wanted to let infected people pour into our country."
The annual gathering of activists and politicians was created in the 1970s to reflect Ronald Reagan's brand of conservatism. But in recent years, the event has become a Trump affair. 
As a private citizen, Trump spoke at CPAC for many years before formally entering politics, but he was never taken seriously by attendees as a presidential contender. 
Romney, now persona non grata at the event because of his conflicts with Trump, was once a darling of the CPAC crowd, winning the group's presidential straw poll in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2012. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) won it in 2015 and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) in 2016 - the years Trump ran for, and won, the presidency.
Now, the mention of Romney's name elicited boos and thumbs-down gestures from the crowd as Trump assailed the 2012 GOP presidential nominee. 
Romney, the only Republican to vote to convict Trump on the abuse of power article of impeachment, said the president's actions were "grievously wrong" in pressuring Ukraine to investigate domestic political rivals, including former vice president Joe Biden.
Anne Copp, a former state representative in New Hampshire, voted for Romney in 2008 and 2012, but said she was very upset by his "grandstanding" vote on impeachment. 
She said she liked that Trump criticized him during his speech. 
"His political career and aspirations are over," she said of Romney. 
Wearing a rhinestone Trump pin, Copp, 59, said she cried multiple times during Trump's speech because she was so moved. 
A lifelong Republican, she said she is worried about the increasing popularity of socialism in the United States - especially among young people. 
But she said there are enough people who recognize the dangers posed by socialism that she thinks Sanders would be the easiest candidate for Trump to beat.
The audience booed when images of Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) flashed on the screen and booed at the mention of socialism. 
Trump basked in chants of "four more years" as he disparaged the Democratic presidential candidates one by one. 
He described a recent Democratic debate in which Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) challenged Bloomberg on his record, marveling at her success and describing Bloomberg's performance as the worst. Trump claimed that Biden couldn't put words together and that if he were elected, others would be running the country while "he'll be sitting in a home somewhere."
He repeated a crowd-driven poll from his rally Friday night in asking the audience to determine the easier candidate for him to beat, "Sleepy Joe" Biden or "Crazy Bernie." 
This crowd, like the one in South Carolina, cheered loudest for Sanders. The only difference was that in South Carolina, Trump urged Republicans to vote for Sanders in their state's Democratic primary - which allows anyone regardless of party to vote. 
But not every Republican is confident that Sanders will be easy to beat. 
Ken Gosnell, 47, who runs his own consulting business in Frederick, Md., said he's concerned about Sanders's strong following but also said he is confident that Trump will win on his record - especially on the strong economy and family values. 
Gosnell's wife was adorned in a short-sleeve dress with TRUMP 2020 emblazoned over it. 
Trump ended his speech vowing to save America before embracing a U.S. flag, kissing it and mouthing three times, "I love you, baby."

It's been an extraordinary few weeks for the stock markets. After reaching record highs just a few weeks ago, markets have plunged dramatically on coronavirus fears. The past week marked the worst for markets since the height of 2008 financial crisis. Investors are panicked that the coronavirus is spreading so quickly, with each day bringing more countries to a standstill, that it threatens the global economy.
So far, relatively few new cases have been appeared in the United States, but public health officials have warned Americans to prepare, which coincided with the beginning of the market slide. The sell-off comes at a precarious time for President Trump who has branded himself as personally responsible for so much of the market gains since he took office. Yet in the past week, Wall Street lost more than a third of stocks gains since President Trump's election in November 2016.

Feb. 11 and 12 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell told Congress the Fed was monitoring economic risks from the virus but that he felt comfortable holding interest rates steady. The next day, global markets rose on signs the infection rate may have plateaued in China. About nine countries outside China had confirmed cases of the virus.
Feb. 19 
Wall Street closed higher after the Fed minutes came out showing Federal Reserve officials expressing optimism in January about the U.S. economy.
Feb. 24
Global markets fell sharply amid reports that Italy and South Korea had more than 200 new cases. But White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow recommended investors buy "these dips." 
Feb. 25
Officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention testified at a congressional hearing that Americans should prepare for the "inevitable" spread of the coronavirus: "It's not a question of if this will happen, but when this will happen."
Feb. 26
President Trump announced that Vice President Pence will lead the response to the coronavirus. A person in Northern California tested positive for the virus, the first case in the United States that has no known link to foreign travel or contact with someone known to be infected.
Feb. 27
The Dow Jones industrial average plunged nearly 1,200 points in one day amid fears that global efforts to contain the coronavirus were failing.
Feb. 28
On a volatile day that saw the Dow at one time sink 1,000 points, the sell-off eased after the Federal Reserve took the unusual step of releasing a statement: "The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring developments. . . . We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."

Coronavirus panic tightened its grip on global markets Friday as the escalating outbreak drove stocks to their worst weekly loss since the 2008 financial crisis and prompted the Federal Reserve to take the unusual step of issuing a statement to reassure Americans.
The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 1,000 points early on, swinging widely throughout the session. It closed down 357 points, or 1.4 percent. The Standard &Poor's 500 index shed 0.8 percent, while the Nasdaq rallied to a flat finish.
The 10-year Treasury yield, a key marker in global finance, also hit a record low Friday, a sign investors are fleeing equities for the safety of bonds. The Cboe Volatility Index, known as the VIX, surged to its highest level since the Great Recession, signaling to investors that more volatility is ahead.
Friday's finish capped a blistering week on Wall Street. All three major U.S. indexes finished in correction, which signals a 10 percent reversal from recent highs and heightens investor worries of a runaway slide. The Dow and the S&P 500 had their worst weeks since the financial crisis, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
The Dow plunged 12 percent for the week, with American Express and Boeing among the biggest losers, shedding 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively. The S&P 500 lost 11.5 percent over the five days, while Nasdaq fell 10 percent. 
All 11 S&P 500 stock market sectors are in a correction, which means equity investors have no place to hide from the carnage. Energy and technology were among the worst hit.
Since Feb. 19, U.S. stocks have lost nearly $3.6 trillion in value.
As stocks nose-dived this week, calls have grown from prominent investors for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, a move that usually calms markets. Wall Street traders are now betting on at least three rate cuts this year, including one rate reduction when the Fed meets on March 18. Interest rates are just below 1.75 percent, a low level by historical standards, but higher than the rates in many other parts of the world.
Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said the central bank would take action if the economy takes a hit from the coronavirus.
Some investors were glad to see the end of February after days of stomach-churning slides.
"Investors had a love-hate relationship with risk in the month of February," said Kristina Hooper, chief market strategist at Invesco. "The first several weeks of the month saw investors embracing stocks. Then as worries grew about the coronavirus outbreak, market participants spent the past six trading days in panic mode. I suspect it will take reassurances from the Fed to stabilize markets."
Global markets also took a beating. In Japan, the Nikkei tumbled 3.7 percent as officials declared a state of emergency in the northern island of Hokkaido and doubts were cast about this summer's Tokyo Olympics. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dived 2.5 percent, and the Shanghai composite skidded 3.7 percent. European markets tipped into correction this week.
Oil prices dived as the global futures market broke below $50 per barrel, a closely watched number that signals whether oil companies and oil-producing countries can make profits.
Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the stock market's decline was not a concern for a big chunk of the population.
"Such a sharp market correction is, of course, a big deal," Bernstein said. "For the half of households who don't own stocks, what matters much more is the economic impact of the virus on their jobs and incomes. There are millions of workers who don't get paid if they can't go to work."

Major companies are beginning to cancel conferences and travel plans within the United States due to the coronavirus, which analysts warn will have cascading impacts on the country's hotels, airlines and convention centers.
International travel - particularly to Asia - has so far been the hardest-hit part of the industry, though analysts say that could soon change as fears of the coronavirus spread to Europe and North America. Hotels around the country have begun reporting a rise in group cancellations. Some air carriers, including Alaska Airlines and JetBlue Airways, are doing away with cancellation fees as jittery travelers rethink their plans.
"The cancellations are starting to move toward North America," said Scott Solombrino, executive director of the Global Business Travel Association, which estimates that the slowdown in global travel has already cost American businesses $7 billion this year. "Obviously the concern is that this will have a long-term impact on the U.S. economy."
Analysts said wide-scale cancellations - which so far have been concentrated in large cities such as New York, Washington and Los Angeles - are starting to hit smaller U.S. cities, as companies change their internal travel policies.
Workday called off a sales conference in Orlando scheduled for next week, while Google and Facebook canceled multiple events in California between March and May. And Amazon this week told employees to put off "nonessential travel" in the United States, though it did not offer details on what types of trips would qualify. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
Mounting cancellations, analysts said, are likely to have ripple effects throughout the economy, particularly for upscale hotels that rely on group bookings for about one-third of their sales, according to Jan Freitag, senior vice president of lodging insights for STR, a hospitality research firm.
"The most noticeable impact so far has been in group travel, with large conferences around the world being canceled," he said. "These large group conferences take years and years to plan. If they don't happen now, there is a good chance they won't happen at all."
Executives at Marriott International, the world's largest hotel chain, said this week that group bookings in the United States have started to take a hit. The Bethesda-based hospitality giant said much of the impact so far has been concentrated in Asia, where it has 800 hotels.
"To date, we have not yet seen a significant impact in the U.S., and our first quarter is off to a solid start, but the situation is fluid," Leeny Oberg, Marriott's chief financial officer, told CNBC on Wednesday. "We have seen a handful of citywide cancellations."
Booking Holdings, which owns Priceline, Booking.com and Kayak, said this week that it expects hotel room bookings to fell as much as 10 percent this quarter because of the coronavirus.
Shares of hotel companies and airlines plunged this week, as coronavirus-related fears led global markets to post their worst weekly losses since the Great Recession. Shares of Marriott and InterContinental Hotels Group fell about 9 percent apiece, while American Airlines and Jet Blue posted declines of more than 20 percent. Expedia Group, meanwhile, posted a 13 percent drop in share price.
"Every day we think we could be near a bottom, and every day we are not," Helane Becker, an airline industry analyst for Cowen, wrote in a note to clients this week. "The virus has spread, and the question is how much do people change their travel plans." 
Hostelling International USA, which oversees nearly 50 properties around the country, said group cancellations are on the rise. Individual travelers, though, are "so far going strong," spokeswoman Netanya Trimboli said.
The company is taking extra precautions by training employees on how to properly clean surfaces and encouraging them to stay home if they feel sick. New signs at its hostels remind guests to wash their hands and cough into their elbows.
Other hotels also report stalling demand, as Americans put off travel plans. But analysts say the largest impact on the hospitality market could come from a slowdown of Chinese visitors, who last year contributed $34 billion to the U.S. economy, according to Philadelphia-based Tourism Economics. Chinese visitors typically spend about $6,000 and spend an average of 15 nights in a hotel while in the United States, the firm said. It expects the number of Chinese travelers to the United States to drop by 25 percent this year.
"Right now there's a lot of uncertainty," said Adam Sacks, president of Tourism Economics. "It's shaping up to be very similar to SARS."
This time, he said, could be worse: Visits from China to the United States have grown nearly 13-fold since 2002, making a possible coronavirus outbreak much more devastating to the U.S. economy than the SARS epidemic was in 2003.
"Reservations are at a standstill," said Kim Lee, who handles sales at Arc The.Hotel, a boutique property in Washington's Foggy Bottom neighborhood.

In Japan, anger over handling of epidemic

Government has
minimized the medical
crisis, critics contend
TOKYO - In Japan, it has been a case of see no virus, hear no virus, speak no virus. 
Or more to the point, don't test people for the novel coronavirus and perhaps the Olympics can still go ahead as planned.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is facing mounting anger over his government's handling of the epidemic, fueled this week by a sudden decision to ask schools to close in March.
But there is also frustration and unease that doctors simply cannot get patients tested for the pneumonia-like virus, a problem that may be causing a vast underreporting in cases of the illness and could become a global concern.
This is a repeat performance of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, critics say. They point to a political elite that reacts to damaging or embarrassing news by burying its head in the sand, sidelining critical experts and suppressing the facts - before finally being provoked by the unfolding disaster into taking extreme measures.
"It looks like Abe is sacrificing the public interest on the altar of the Olympics and is determined to prevent headlines of an escalating outbreak," said Jeff Kingston, a political science professor at Temple University at Japan. "He has shirked and shifted responsibility in a sluggish crisis response and has tried to bury the bad news just like they do in dictatorships."
Perhaps the biggest problem has been the lack of capability to conduct tests for the virus and the failure to sufficiently expand that capacity even two months into the epidemic, criticisms that have also been heard in the United States.
The Asahi newspaper has reported on many examples of patients who ran fevers for many days but could not obtain tests, including a man in his 60s who had a high temperature for 12 consecutive days and needed an oxygen inhaler but still could not get tested.
So widespread has the problem become that the Japan Medical Association issued a statement Wednesday asking for an investigation into cases in which doctors ordered tests that they deemed necessary, but public health centers refused to carry them out.
Japan initially limited tests to people who had developed symptoms and had traveled to China, or had come into close contact with an infected person. But it later expanded tests to people who had a fever for four consecutive days, or two days if the patient was elderly or pregnant. Many experts say those rules are too rigid but are not being respected because there are not enough tests for the novel coronavirus that causes the disease named covid-19.
The tests are also insufficiently sensitive, some experts say. They note that many former passengers from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship who tested negative in Japan have been tested positive in the United States, Australia, Hong Kong and Israel. 
Masahiro Kami, a doctor and executive director of the Medical Governance Research Institute in Tokyo, said people with mild symptoms are not being tested.
"Given that we get some 10 million cases of the influenza annually, I think there are probably already at least hundreds of thousands of cases in Japan," he said.
Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament he would look into the "stumbling blocks" over tests. He said Japan is capable of conducting 3,800 tests a day, yet carried out only 900 a day in the seven days from Feb. 18 to 24. South Korea is carrying out about 10,000 tests a day, one reason it has found 2,022 cases and Japan only 214.
Part of the problem is that Japan, unlike the United States, South Korea and China, has no Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
All the power is closely guarded by the Prime Minister's Office, and then by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, whose National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) has much less independence than centers for disease control in other countries. 
That structure leaves politicians and bureaucrats running the show rather than medical experts. The NIID has also been overwhelmed by the scale of the crisis, bureaucrats admit.
Japan's tendency to bury bad news was thrown into stark relief last week when a leading infectious disease expert recorded a widely watched video complaining of inadequate infection controls on board the Diamond Princess.
Within two days, Kentaro Iwata was forced to remove the video from YouTube in the face of a concerted attempt to undermine his claims and disparage his character, with one senior official calling him a "maverick" and "not a team player."
Stubbornly insisting that Iwata was wrong and that the 14-day quarantine on the Diamond Princess had been a success, Japan released hundreds of passengers back into the general population and refused to even test medical staff members who worked on the ship, even though at least eight officials, a medic and an ambulance driver had caught the virus.
A mounting tide of criticism and falling poll numbers may have prompted Abe to try to regain the initiative by asking schools to close this week. 
But the decision robs millions of parents and children of the chance to attend graduation ceremonies, as the academic year ends in March. It also creates headaches for parents who work and lack child-care options.
Public broadcaster NHK and the Kyodo News agency reported that Abe's request has sown "confusion" and anger. 
Kyodo quoted a senior official in the Education Ministry as being stunned by the announcement, which apparently came without consultation. A ruling party lawmaker was quoted as saying the party should urge Abe to retract it.
In the western Japanese city of Kyoto, the municipal education board said schools would open as normal on Monday, while a decision on how to proceed for the rest of the week would be made later.
The major of Chiba, a city near Tokyo, tweeted that the school closure "could result in a breakdown of Japanese society."
On Friday, Abe told parliament that his government plans to push ahead with the plan to close schools. He asked for understanding and called a news conference for Saturday evening.

United extends China flight cancellations

United Airlines announced Friday it won't restart flights between the U.S. and China until May and is paring back its schedule to other parts of Asia as the coronavirus epidemic spreads. 
The Chicago-based airline said it is reducing service to Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore and Seoul, offering fewer flights and smaller planes, beginning next month.
"It is a fast-moving situation," United spokeswoman Leslie Scott said. "We are in daily contact with the CDC and other global health organizations as we continue to evaluate our schedule."
While United halted flights to China in early February, this is the first time it has reduced capacity to other Asian destinations as a result of the growing epidemic, Scott said.
The airline has seen a 75% drop in demand for its Asian routes, outside of China, in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, according a filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Before the suspension of service, United had about 12 flights each day between the U.S. and China, including flights connecting Chicago to Beijing and Shanghai at O'Hare International Airport.
The additional reduction in service will cancel the O'Hare to Tokyo Narita route from March 8 to March 27. United is scheduled to resume flights between Chicago and Tokyo on March 28, when it will switch to Tokyo Haneda Airport, which is closer to the city. The change is unrelated to the virus, Scott said.
American Airlines does not have direct service between Chicago and China, but earlier this month extended its suspension of all flights to China out of its Dallas and Los Angeles hubs through April 24. This week, Fort Worth, Texas-based American also added flight waivers to Italy and South Korea because of the coronavirus outbreak, allowing passengers to make travel changes without fees.
Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines previously suspended all flights to China through April 30, and this week reduced service to South Korea. Delta has issued travel waivers for China, South Korea and all flights to and from Italy, including Bologna, Milan, Rome, Venice and Turin in response to increased coronavirus cases there.
United also issued flight waivers for China and Hong Kong, and this week added South Korea and northern Italy to the list of no-fee travel changes.
The virus, now dubbed COVID-19, has disrupted travel since reports of the new respiratory illness first surfaced in Wuhan, China, in late December. China remains the epicenter of the disease, with nearly 79,000 confirmed cases and more than 2,700 deaths as of Thursday, according to the World Health Organization.
But the virus has since spread to about 50 countries, with confirmed cases on the rise in South Korea, Italy and Iran, among other countries, according to health organizations.
There have been 61 confirmed cases in the U.S., according to the CDC, including two in the Chicago area. A woman who returned from a visit to Wuhan, China, in January gave the virus to her husband in the first known case of person-to-person coronavirus transmission in the U.S., according to the CDC. The couple has since been released from a hospital in northwest suburban Hoffman Estates.

U.S. News: 'Remain In Mexico' Is Ruled Unlawful

A federal appeals court ruled the Trump administration must halt a policy of returning migrants along the southern U.S. border to Mexico while their requests for asylum in the U.S. are considered.
The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, on Friday ruled the policy was inconsistent with federal immigration law and U.S. international treaty obligations not to return aliens to countries where their life or freedom would be threatened due to their race, religion, nationality, or political or social affiliations.
The court, in its 2-to-1 ruling, said its decision applied to the entire southern U.S. border, citing the need for uniform immigration rules. Because the policy "is invalid in its entirety . . . it should be enjoined in its entirety," Judge William Fletcher, a Clinton appointee, wrote for the court.
The ruling is a considerable setback for the Trump administration, which said the "Remain in Mexico" policy was one of its most effective in slowing the wave of asylum seekers arriving at the southern border from Central America and elsewhere.
Illegal border crossings have fallen more than 75% since their peak in May, around the time when the administration vastly expanded "Remain in Mexico."
The administration signaled in court papers late Friday that it will seek Supreme Court review.
The White House described the decision as "another reckless nationwide injunction threatening our constitutional structure."
Press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the policy was a success and the court's decision aggravates the threat of coronavirus. "If today's ruling is allowed to stand, these successes will be reversed, which threatens to flood the Nation's immigration system, present unchecked coronavirus entry risk . . . and reignite the humanitarian and security crisis at the border," she said.
The decision marked a shift for the appeals court, which had issued a preliminary ruling last May that allowed the administration to implement the policy until the court reached its final decision. Joining Judge Fletcher was Judge Richard Paez, also a Clinton appointee. In dissent, Judge Ferdinand Fernandez, a George H.W. Bush appointee, said the court should have been bound by its earlier decision.
The "Remain in Mexico" policy, formally called the Migrant Protection Protocols, made its debut in January 2019 as the Trump administration sought alternatives to releasing families seeking asylum into the U.S., where they were permitted to live for months, and often years, as their cases made their way through backlogged immigration courts.
In the past year, the government has sent more than 60,000 migrants seeking asylum back across the border, where they were required to wait in violent Mexican border cities for months for U.S. court dates. Many migrants who have been returned -- estimated at about half, according to recent data -- simply drop their claims before they are decided.
The arrival of throngs of Central American and other Spanish-speaking migrants has created humanitarian crises in several of the cities where they have been waiting.
Fearing a court could halt the "Remain in Mexico" program, the administration created several other avenues to deport asylum seekers quickly. Some have been sent to Guatemala under a "safe third country" pact.

REVIEW --- Europe's Face-Off With China --- Countries that once saw Xi Jinping as a possible ally on global issues now find themselves resisting Beijing's authoritarian sway.

Just three years ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping skillfully soothed European sensibilities at the annual gathering of global elites in Davos, Switzerland, as he praised the virtues of multilateralism, free trade and fighting climate change.
To many Europeans, China's authoritarian leader briefly seemed a more appealing partner than President Donald Trump, who has since withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate treaty, disparaged the European Union and questioned the value of NATO. Mr. Xi's ambitious Belt and Road project also made European politicians salivate over tens of billions of dollars in anticipated Chinese infrastructure investments.
That infatuation is waning, however, as Europe confronts China's rise as a superpower and attempts to navigate a new international order that is shaped more and more by the rivalry between Washington and Beijing. China's appeal has been further eroded by the secretive manner in which Chinese authorities initially managed the outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus, which this week became a public-health emergency in Italy and a threat to other European economies.
Increasingly repressive at home under Mr. Xi, the Chinese party-state is now trying to stifle public criticism abroad, including in Europe. In recent months, these heavy-handed attempts to influence, and sometimes bully, European nations have triggered a backlash, drawing attention to the Chinese system's fundamental difference with Western democracies.
"China is trying to export its governance model across the word, including into Europe," said Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, a think tank that advises Germany's government and parliament. "Europe is waking up to dealing with China not only as a customer, a marketplace and a big factory, but as a geopolitical and geoeconomic actor that is certainly a partner in many respects but also a competitor and a challenger, including to our values."
Positive views of China shrank in much of the EU last year, according to opinion polls. In Sweden, one of several European countries experiencing this new chill with Beijing, things have gotten so nasty recently that three major parties have demanded the expulsion of the Chinese ambassador to Stockholm, citing his public threats to Swedish officials, media and human-rights groups. "Some Swedish businesses now have to take into account Swedish public opinion: 'Why do you do business in China, such a terrible country?' That is quite new," said Lars Freden, a former Swedish ambassador to Beijing.
Europe's expected Belt and Road bonanza, meanwhile, has by and large failed to materialize as China's own economy has slowed down -- troubles that began well before the stringent measures to contain the coronavirus. "The period of romantic optimism is over," said Latvia's Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics. "Four years ago it was only about the economy, about trade, about the Belt and Road, about more investment. Now, it is more balanced."
A fellow minister from a major EU nation put it less diplomatically. "Frankly, we see no reason why we should be kneeling to China," he said. "They are not doing us any favors."
China remains vital to the European economy, of course, and retains a network of influence on the continent. Bilateral trade stood at 604 billion euros ($665 billion) in 2018, the last year for which EU statistics are available, with a 185 billion euro deficit ($203 billion) in China's favor. Chinese companies have invested heavily in key pieces of Europe's infrastructure, like Greece's main port of Pireaus and Portugal's power utility, and control iconic European manufacturers such as Sweden's Volvo Cars and Italy's Pirelli.
Distracted by dealing with Russia and with Britain's departure from the bloc, the EU is only now attempting to put together a coherent policy on China. Perennial rivalries within the EU, where smaller states often suspect Germany and France of skewing the rules in their own favor, have complicated the process.
Still, last March, the European Commission for the first time defined China as a "systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance" -- a departure from the previous approach that viewed China mostly through the lens of lucrative trade opportunities. European leaders are working to come up with a common position ahead of the summit between Mr. Xi and 27 EU leaders scheduled for September in the German city of Leipzig.
As this new attitude sets in, the overriding priority for Europe is to avoid getting trampled by the two superpowers, EU officials say. "We Europeans cannot accept the idea that the world should organize itself around a new Sino-American bipolarity which would come to replace, after a 30-year transition period, the Soviet-American bipolarity that literally divided Europe," said the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell.
Europe's sudden awakening to China's growing clout, and to Beijing's threat to its democratic values, is happening at a time of profound discord with the U.S. Mr. Trump remains deeply unpopular in European nations, in part because of his threats of a trade war. At home, however, his desire to contain China has bipartisan support, which means that the pressure on Europe to take sides is almost certain to continue whether or not Mr. Trump wins a second term in November.
"We have two main worries now. Are we still allies with the U.S.? And where is China heading with its authoritarian turn?" said France's former prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, who informally advises President Emmanuel Macron. "What's at stake for us is to become strong enough that we don't turn into a ping-pong ball hit by the American and Chinese rackets."
While European leaders agree, in principle at least, that Europe's best response to this challenge is to grow its own capacities -- in defense, technology, industry and diplomacy -- there are two main schools of thought on the best strategy to achieve that goal.
One asserts that, regardless of the EU's many disagreements with Mr. Trump, trans-Atlantic ties are more essential than ever before and Europe should stand firmly by America's side. "The U.S. is not able to deal with China alone, and Europe is not able to deal with China alone," said Latvia's Mr. Rinkevics. "If you look at it from the values point of view, from the strategic point of view, the U.S. should be our number one partner in addressing these issues, even though it's not an easy partner."
To other European leaders, however, this approach is rooted in wishful thinking. The U.S., they argue, already began disengaging from Europe under President Barack Obama, and EU interests are increasingly at odds with Washington's. This means that Europe should stay out of the fight and pursue its own course.
France's President Macron has pressed this point, insisting on greater "strategic autonomy" for Europe and arguing for renewed engagement with Russia to limit China's power. Such thinking reflects a major shift, from seeing Russia as Europe's biggest security threat, in the wake of the 2014 invasion of Ukraine, to realizing that China poses an even more severe challenge -- economically, politically and even militarily.
The surprisingly rapid expansion of China's military base in Djibouti -- a former French colony on the Horn of Africa -- has enabled China to project power in Europe's own neighborhood. To France, this point was made clear in July 2017, when Chinese warships sailing in the Mediterranean briefly outnumbered those of the French Navy.
Chinese officials, in their meetings with Europeans, insist that Beijing's intentions are nothing but benign. "The world today needs solidarity and cooperation between China and Europe," Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at the Munich Security Conference in February. "China-EU cooperation has become even more significant, especially in today's world where a certain major country has abandoned international cooperation and pursued unilateralism. China always believes that for China and the EU, our areas of consensus outweigh differences."
Such assurances meet an increasingly skeptical response, however, in part because of a new pattern of behavior by Chinese government representatives. These days in Europe, public discussion of matters such as the treatment of the Uighur minority in Xinjiang, protests in Hong Kong or the Chinese authorities' initial mishandling of the Wuhan coronavirus often prompts angry public interventions by Chinese diplomats. From Stockholm to Prague to Rome, the Chinese message is: Keep quiet or your economies will suffer.
In the Czech Republic, China responded to plans by the mayor of Prague to foster cooperation with Taiwan by canceling a 14-city tour by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra scheduled for last fall and by blocking subsequent visits of several other cultural institutions based in the city.
Despite frequent threats, Beijing has stopped short of imposing serious economic sanctions, in part because such a step against any individual EU nation would likely invite retaliation from the entire EU.
So far, at least, China's new bullying approach seems to be backfiring. That's especially the case on the issue that currently matters most to Beijing: whether to allow its Huawei telecom giant to play a significant role in building Europe's 5G networks. The U.S. is lobbying hard to keep Huawei's cheaper equipment out of European networks. "Huawei and other state-backed Chinese companies are Trojan horses for Chinese intelligence," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in Munich.
Huawei insists that it is independent from the Chinese Communist Party and last year sued French researchers who alleged otherwise. At the same time, however, China's ambassador to Berlin has issued implicit threats of targeting the German car industry if Huawei is excluded.
Such Chinese pressure ignited a rebellion against Chancellor Angela Merkel's relatively soft approach to Huawei within her own CDU party. A CDU position paper published this month calls for limiting participation in 5G by "untrustworthy" suppliers that are beholden to a foreign state, and a cross-party alliance of government and opposition lawmakers now wants to ban companies like Huawei from Germany's 5G system. The final 5G legislation is still being drafted.
"It tells you something if official representatives of another state dare to interfere in a parliamentary process of legislation," said Norbert Rottgen, who heads the foreign-affairs committee in the German parliament and is running to succeed Ms. Merkel at the helm of the CDU. "This requires us to send a strong signal that we take our own decisions."
In France, the biggest mobile operator, Orange, already announced in January that it won't use Huawei equipment.
In Italy, which became the first big Western nation to join the Belt and Road initiative just last March, the mood on China has also soured, in part because of similar bullying attempts by Beijing. In November, a handful of Italian lawmakers decided to hold a videoconference with Joshua Wong, a leader of the Hong Kong protesters. The Chinese embassy in Rome blasted the plan as a "grave error and irresponsible behavior" that "supports violence and crime."
That attempt to scuttle a parliamentary event prompted all the main political parties as well as Italy's foreign ministry to condemn Chinese meddling. Days later, the Italian parliament's lower house unanimously passed a resolution supporting democratic freedoms in Hong Kong.
Nowhere in Europe is the backlash against China as strong as in Sweden, however. According to Pew, the number of people with a favorable opinion of China declined by 8 percentage points to 33% in France last year, by 11 points to 36% in the Netherlands and by 5 points to 34% in Germany. In Sweden, the favorable rating of China sank to 25% in 2019 from 42% the year before.
Sweden's troubles with China began in 2015, when a Chinese-born Swedish citizen, Gui Minhai, disappeared on a trip to Thailand. A publisher once based in Hong Kong, Mr. Gui angered Chinese authorities by writing about alleged corruption in the family of Mr. Xi and other subjects considered taboo in Beijing.
Swedish officials say that Mr. Gui was kidnapped by Chinese operatives. Beijing says that the publisher turned himself in voluntarily to Chinese police to stand trial for a 2003 drunken-driving episode that resulted in the death of a young woman and, after his release two years later, was rearrested for "illegally providing state secrets and intelligence."
The controversy turned into a crisis last November when Sweden's PEN Center drew attention to Mr. Gui's plight by awarding him the prestigious Tucholsky literary prize, which is usually delivered by the country's culture minister. The decision drew a livid response from China's ambassador to Stockholm, Gui Congyou, whose outbursts have made him a household name in the country. "Normal exchanges and cooperation will be seriously hindered," especially if Swedish officials attended the ceremony, he warned. "Some people in Sweden shouldn't feel at ease after hurting the feelings of the Chinese people."
Sweden's government ignored the warning and the culture minister delivered the prize anyway, at a ceremony where an empty chair was left for the jailed publisher. On Tuesday, a court in China's Ningbo city said that Mr. Gui has been sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment.
Such brushes with an increasingly intolerant, and self-confident, new China offer a sobering lesson to all Western democracies, according to Jesper Bengtsson, the chairman of the Swedish PEN Center. "We always used to talk about the spread of democracy and universal values, and about how we can affect change in countries like China from a position of strength," Mr. Bengtsson said. "We now realize that we are not necessarily the strong party here. There has been a shift of power in the world."

BEIJING -- Official gauges of China's factory and nonfactory activity plunged to record lows in February as the nation's economy struggled to resume normal production amid the coronavirus epidemic.
The official manufacturing purchasing managers index tumbled to 35.7 in February from 50 in January, indicating a deep contraction. February's reading from the National Bureau of Statistics on Saturday was the first official data for a full month of economic activity in China since the coronavirus began affecting the economy in late January.
The index dropped to 38.8 in November 2008, when the financial crisis prompted steep losses on Wall Street and sent shockwaves through the global economy. The 50 mark separates expansion from contraction.
Adding to the gloom, China's nonmanufacturing PMI, also released on Saturday, sank to a record low of 29.6 in February from 54.1 in January. The nonmanufacturing PMI covers such services as retail, aviation and software as well as real estate and construction.
The factory index indicated contraction for most of 2019, hit by a trade war between the U.S. and China. It didn't cross back into expansion until late last year, when trade tensions between the two sides eased.
The February result came in far below the median forecast of 43 by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. Purchasing by manufacturers is a leading indicator of business activity because factories buy supplies in anticipation of demand.
Saturday's results show a "relatively large impact" from the epidemic, Zhao Qinghe, an analyst with the statistics bureau, said in a statement accompanying the data release. March's readings should improve because of authorities' efforts to help companies, especially manufacturing firms, resume production, he said.
January's factory reading of 50 -- indicating neither expansion nor contraction -- didn't fully reflect the impact of the epidemic since the previous month's official survey was completed by Jan. 20.
Economic activity ground to a halt across the country after authorities locked down Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the epidemic, on Jan. 23.
While February's reading reflects the first full month in which the outbreak was widely known, it also overlaps with the Lunar New Year period, which regularly distorts economic activity in the first two months of the year, depending on when it falls in the Western calendar.

World News: In U.S., a Risk to Drug Supply Emerges --- China is a key provider of raw materials, chemicals for medicines popular abroad

Factory shutdowns across China because of the coronavirus have exposed an uncomfortable health-care reality: Many medicines rely on raw materials that are made in that country.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Thursday said one drug already has gone into shortage because of difficulties obtaining a raw ingredient from a site affected by the coronavirus. It didn't disclose which drug or its manufacturer.
For several weeks, the FDA has been contacting more than 180 drug manufacturers, reminding them to provide notification of any expected supply shortages. That includes the makers of roughly 20 products the agency has identified as containing key pharmaceutical ingredients from China.
Most vulnerable are generic drugs, which make up some 90% of the medicines taken by Americans. Nongeneric, or branded, prescription medicines tend to have supply lines linked to other parts of the world.
Certain classes of drugs, too, are at special risk. China is a key supplier of the chemical and raw materials for popular blood pressure medicines and several older antibiotics that are no longer manufactured in the U.S., such as doxycycline and penicillin.
Big drugmakers such as Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., one of the world's largest generic manufacturers, have said in statements before the shortage was announced that they were monitoring their supply chains and hadn't experienced any disruptions.
On Thursday's quarterly earnings call, Mylan NV said it continues to monitor the situation and noted the company's diversified supply lines, but warned that shortages could occur in the future. The company's president, Rajiv Malik, said, "Our whole industry is in one way or other way connected with China, but you would expect us to be much better placed."
Experts believe China is also the only maker of key ingredients in a class of decades-old antibiotics known as cephalosporins, which treat a range of bacterial infections, including pneumonia.
"The antibiotic supply chain is becoming increasingly fragile, even without a global epidemic centered in the major manufacturing location," said Dan Diekema, director of infectious diseases at the University of Iowa Healthcare, a hospital. "If we were to have major disruptions that caused shortages of several antibiotics at once, it would challenge our ability to adapt."
Several generic manufacturers have seen prices on pharmaceutical raw materials grow by as much as 50%, including those for common products such as cholesterol-lowering statins, according to research by Sanford C. Bernstein &Co.
Drugmakers are adjusting, including by looking for alternative suppliers and raising prices, said industry experts and officials. Some Chinese firms stopped shipping to manufacturers in India, said David Light, chief executive of Valisure, an online pharmacy that works with advisers in India. The Indian generic-drug industry, which the FDA says supplies 40% of U.S. generic drugs, relies on China for much of its active ingredients.
With hundreds of manufacturing plants and other workplaces in China suspending operations in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus, more pressure on the pharmaceutical supply chain looms large. Yet details on the medicines supply lines into the U.S. are limited, hampering authorities' ability to anticipate which drugs are most vulnerable.
China is recognized as the world's biggest supplier of the raw materials -- known as active pharmaceutical ingredients -- that form the basis of medicines. That dependence on China makes shortages more likely should Chinese manufacturing be shaken, according to a 2019 U.S. government report. China's dominance is growing: The U.S. imported $3.9 billion worth of pharmaceutical raw material from China in 2017, an increase of nearly one-quarter from the prior year, says IHS Markit.
Even before the outbreak of the Covid-19 disease, experts for years have warned that overreliance on a single region posed risks to the U.S. health-care system. An explosion in 2016 at a plant in China led to a world-wide shortage of the antibiotic piperacillin.
"The pharma industry is pretty much bound hand and foot with manufacturers in China," said Robert Walsh, whose company Samara Biopharma Consulting audits Chinese factories on behalf of Western drugmakers.
The industry has some cushion. Drugmakers tend to stock up in advance of China's Lunar New Year holiday, over which factories typically close for two weeks. They also order raw materials in bulk and maintain about six months of supply, industry officials say.
"The question is, how far in time do these stockpiles go, and can we continue to rely as heavily as we do on manufacturing of these critical supplies offshore," said Rita Numeroff, a health-care business strategist.
The intricacies of the supply chains for individual medicines -- which companies keep under wraps for competitive reasons -- remain hidden from the public. While the FDA requires manufacturers to report when there is a shortage of a specific product, companies that make the raw materials aren't subject to such demands. Nor must they disclose the size, or timing, of shipments being made to the U.S., limiting the ability of hospitals and other providers to plan for potential supply disruptions.
The FDA says it has no way to track API volume out of China. "We technically have no idea what is actually manufactured in China," said Soumi Saha, senior director of advocacy at Premier, one of the largest group-purchasing organizations in the U.S. contracting for drugs and other supplies for hospitals. "We're missing that upstream visibility."
Trying to shed light on the medicines-supply chain is Mike Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. He is leading an effort to map out the supply chains for around 150 of the most important medicines and medical devices in the U.S., by piecing together information from shipping records, company disclosures and FDA data. Although the project started around 18 months ago, he said the coronavirus outbreak has put it "on steroids."

EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: China's Crisis Is Also Virtual --- The epidemic's impact on advertising is another problem for Baidu and Weibo

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
People are spending more time in the virtual world these days, but a real-world epidemic could still hurt online advertising platforms in China.
Chinese search giant Baidu said Friday that its revenue this quarter could drop 5% to 13% year over year due to the coronavirus. Excluding its video-streaming subsidiary iQiyi, which has received a boost as many people are stuck at home because of the coronavirus epidemic, Baidu's core business is expected to see a decline of between 10% and 18%. Earlier this week, Weibo, which runs a Twitter-like service, said sales this quarter could fall 15% to 20% compared with the same period last year.
While advertising for online games and online learning has increased, it has gone the other way for automobiles, real estate and travel. Sales of cars, for example, crashed 92% in the first 16 days of February, according to the China Passenger Car Association.
Baidu said activity has started to pick up in the past two weeks as people are gradually returning to work, and that revenue was delayed rather than lost. "If you plan to get married, you'll still get married. If you plan to buy a car, you will still buy a car. If you plan to become prettier, you will still go for cosmetic surgery. So this kind of demand will come back after the epidemic ends," said Robin Li, Baidu's chairman.
While business will certainly improve later this year, the hangover could last longer than the outbreak. Small businesses may run out of cash and workers risk losing their jobs. This is bad for consumer spending and investment, and hence advertising.
Even when things are back to normal, companies that rely on advertising income like Baidu and Weibo will still face the same challenging environment that has sapped their growth for the past couple of years. Bytedance, which owns TikTok, has been grabbing users' attention and companies' marketing budgets. E-commerce platforms Alibaba and newcomer Pinduoduo have continued to sweep up ad dollars from online merchants. Even Meituan, which sells everything from food delivery to flights, has seen a surge in advertising income.
That has left Baidu and Weibo with stagnant core businesses. Baidu's online marketing revenue dropped 2% last quarter from a year earlier, while Weibo's fell 3%. Both stocks have more than halved from their peaks in 2018.
While online advertising in the U.S. has evolved into something of an duopoly under Google and Facebook, in China it is fragmented and wildly competitive. The coronavirus is a headache at the moment, but a return to normality will just leave Baidu and Weibo with bigger problems.

FDA reports the first drug shortage tied to outbreak; Agency declines to name the company or medication. Expert says feds may want to avoid panic buying.

Health officials reported the first U.S. drug shortage tied to the viral outbreak that is disrupting production in China, but they declined to identify the manufacturer or the product.
The Food and Drug Administration said late Thursday that the drug's maker recently contacted officials about the shortage, which it blamed on a manufacturing issue with the medicine's key ingredient. Regulators stressed that alternative medicines are available to treat patients.
The FDA previously said it had reached out to 180 drug manufacturers and asked them to check their supply chain and report any potential disruptions.
The agency also said it had identified 20 drugs produced or sourced exclusively from China, but it declined to name them.
The FDA has good reason to not release the names of drugs facing potential shortages, said Rosemary Gibson, who wrote the book "China Rx," on that nation's role in American healthcare.
"People might rush to buy it and that would create a worse situation," said Gibson, a senior advisor at the Hastings Center, a bioethics research group. "In the context of shortages globally, you have to be very, very careful."
More than 84,000 COVID-19 cases have been reported worldwide, nearly 79,000 of them in mainland China. Government officials there have severely restricted travel and imposed strict quarantine measures to try to stop the virus from spreading.
Restrictions on movements of people and goods have been imposed by at least 90 countries, and that's disrupting the flow of drugs and raw materials, said Nicolette Louissaint, executive director of Healthcare Ready, a nonprofit group funded by drug distributors, government and foundations that tracks the effects of epidemics and natural disasters.
For decades, the pharmaceutical industry has shifted manufacturing to China, India and other countries to take advantage of cheaper labor and materials.
Today, roughly 80% of the ingredients used in U.S. medicines are made abroad, according to federal figures. India and other Asian nations rely on Chinese drug ingredients to make finished generic pills.
China ranks second among countries that send drugs and biotech medicines to the U.S., according to the FDA. It is also the top exporter of medical devices and equipment to the U.S.
The country is a major producer of antibiotics for the U.S. market, as well as ingredients and medicines for common chronic conditions such as heart disease, Louissaint said.
The virus, which led to strict travel restrictions in Chinese cities home to more than 60 million people combined, has affected a range of industries. Some factories have tried to restart and have run into problems getting the raw materials and components they need.
Chinese factories making pharmaceutical ingredients and drugs are still operating, with some trying to produce far more than usual and others still trying to get workers back, Louissaint said Friday. Cargo carriers are still transporting those products from China to other countries, she said.
"It is challenging," but fortunately Chinese ports have remained open, Louissaint said.
She added that the FDA's announcement of the shortage indicates the FDA's tracking efforts are working and drugmakers are communicating with the agency.
The FDA said Thursday there were no reported medical device shortages related to the coronavirus. However, the agency said several Chinese device manufacturing facilities were being "adversely affected" by staffing problems, including workers who have been quarantined.
The FDA said it is in touch with 63 device manufacturers with Chinese facilities that produce "essential" medical devices. While noting increased orders for masks, respirators, gloves and other protective gear, regulators said there are no reported shortages of those items in the U.S.
Under a 2012 law, drugmakers are required to notify the FDA of production or sourcing issues that could create medication shortages.
The agency noted this week that medical device manufacturers are not bound by that law and "are not required to respond when the FDA requests information about potential supply chain disruptions."

Saudi Arabia suspends entry for certain pilgrimages

It took several years for Hina Baig to save up thousands of dollars for her family's special pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia. They were supposed to leave next week. On Wednesday, she learned the trip was canceled, after the country suspended entry for the purposes of certain pilgrimages called umrah and visits to the prophet Muhammad's mosque, a holy site.
Baig, 40, shed tears. The washed and folded clothes prepared for the trip are still laid out around the bedroom of her home near Houston, and she doesn't know what will happen to the $7,000 her family spent.
"Hopefully we don't lose that money, because then it'll take me another 20 years to go," she said.
Baig is among millions of Muslims across the country and around the globe who were planning to make the umrah, visiting Mecca and walking in the steps of the prophet. These trips are especially popular during the month of Ramadan, which starts in April.
Baig wanted the trip to be a family event for herself, her husband and their two teenagers. She'd heard about the pilgrimages since she was a child.
"I remember when you're a kid and you finally get to go to Disney, and it's sort of like that," she said. "But it's so spiritual."
The announcement from Saudi Arabia that it was temporarily suspending entry to the country for the purposes of umrah and visiting Muhammad's mosque caused a lot of confusion among Muslims who have had plans to visit the region. Many are currently finalizing plans for the major hajj pilgrimage, which begins at the end of July.
It is unclear when the country's restrictions will be lifted or how they could affect hajj, during which millions of Muslims mingle in tight quarters for several days and sleep in tents. Saudi Arabia has yet to report any cases of coronavirus. But its neighbor, Iran, has documented more than 300.
"Saudi Arabia renews its support for all international measures to limit the spread of this virus and urges its citizens to exercise caution before travelling to countries experiencing coronavirus outbreaks," the Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement announcing the decision to halt entry for umrah and also bar all tourist visas for citizens of countries where Saudi authorities have deemed the spread of the virus to be a threat.
Umrah can be performed at any time of year and is encouraged, not mandatory. Pilgrims typically visit Mecca, home to the cube-shaped Kaaba shrine that Muslims pray toward five times a day. They also visit the holy city of Medina to walk the path of Muhammad and visit his tomb.
Athif Hussain, a 29-year-old who lives in Ashburn, Va., was supposed to leave for umrah with his father and brother at the end of March. As of Friday, it was unclear whether they would go.
"This is the first time where Saudi Arabia has put limitations like this that we know of," he said. "It's anxiety-inducing and feels like we're taking a risk."
Tarek El Messidi, who is planning to be a spiritual guide for umrah pilgrims for two weeks in March, spent this week reassuring 73 American Muslims scheduled to go on the trip that everything was still on schedule. He still expects to get tourist visas for them next week, but there's confusion around whether tourists will be able to visit the holy sites.
El Messidi, who lives in Philadelphia and leads Celebrate Mercy, a Muslim group that focuses on Islamic teachings and social justice, said Saudi Arabia's restrictions meant an Egyptian with a green card who had signed up for the trip would not be able to go, since he needs a special umrah permit, rather than a tourist visa, to enter the country.
Of the others in his group, who come from across the United States, "no one has said, 'This is a risk and I'm not going,' " El Messidi said. "I'm surprised, because we have some people who are anxious about other things."
El Messidi is working with the Dar el Salam tourist agency, one of the bigger agencies that takes people on pilgrimages. He shared a video with his group that shows a Dar el Salam tour guide who had landed in Saudi Arabia this week with a group of Americans and filmed himself from the bus, saying that everything was fine.
"I can tell they're freaking out because they're sharing notes like don't cancel, be patient," El Messidi said of the tourist agency.
For Muslims, hajj is an even bigger deal than umrah, because it is required for all able-bodied Muslims who can afford it to go at least once in their lifetimes.
Pilgrims are not supposed to wear anything around their faces, including head coverings like the niqab, so face masks to prevent the spread of disease generally have not been permitted.
Making hajj usually takes at least 10 days, costs thousands of dollars and involves its own visa process through a tour agency.
"Once you make that intention, whatever comes from God comes from God," said Dilshad D. Ali, an editor at Haute Hijab who writes on Muslims in America. "If you've made the intention, you just let it ride."

As markets fall, usual remedies may not work

The stock market fell for the seventh straight day Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average losing 357 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 25,409. Only by staging a late rally in the final 15 minutes of trading was the Dow able to avert its third daily loss this week of more than 1,000 points.
The sustained sell-off, driven by fears of global economic damage from the spreading coronavirus, prompted both the Federal Reserve and the White House to hunt for possible remedies, eyeing tools they have used during past crises to calm the public.
The traditional tactics, however, may not work against a financial panic driven by a global health scare that lacks precedent or antidote.
A sign of the crisis-fighting difficulties ahead came in the afternoon, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell issued an unusual statement vowing to "act as appropriate" to defend the U.S. economy from the outbreak. Many analysts interpreted the statement as a pledge to cut interest rates, a signal that often heartens investors. But this time, the sell-off continued.
After a week that shaved more than $4 trillion from global stock values, Powell's effort was among a series of steps meant to reassure frazzled investors. Nothing, so far, appears to be working.
"The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong," Powell said. "However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook. We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."
Evercore ISI, an investment firm, told clients Friday that it now expects the Fed to cut rates by a half-percentage point at its mid-March meeting, something few expected just one week ago. 
Meanwhile, White House officials held meetings of their own Friday, considering potential tax-cut packages that they hope might boost consumer confidence. This comes after several days of unsuccessful efforts by President Trump and his economic team to cajole people to buy stocks and drive prices higher.
The Fed and White House deliberations illustrate how policymakers are searching for ways to arrest the sudden sell-off, which some analysts say raises the possibility of a recession later this year.
Typically, the Fed responds to economic trouble by lowering interest rates to make credit easier to obtain. It also can offer loans to banks or buy large quantities of U.S. Treasury securities, effectively adding money to the financial system and making it easier for some corporate borrowers to get cash. The White House and Congress, meanwhile, can approve new spending or tax cuts to flood the economy with money.
But the best remedy for the coronavirus - which has sickened more than 83,000 people worldwide and killed nearly 3,000 - could lie beyond Washington's immediate powers.
"Central banks don't make vaccines," said David Kotok, chairman of Cumberland Advisors.
The renewed selling intensified calls for the Fed to rescue the economy from an unforeseen shock. The medical emergency already has disrupted global production networks, curtailed air travel and hobbled economies in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. With medical experts urging Americans to prepare for serious disruptions in their daily lives, pleas for early action are coming from Wall Street and some former members of the Fed's rate-setting committee.
"The Fed can't fix broken supply chains or calm concerns about health and safety. But the Fed can ensure that liquidity conditions remain supportive, so firms can get funding through the disruption. It can also provide support to financial markets," said Nathan Sheets, chief economist for PGIM Fixed Income. "More generally, the message that the Fed is attentive and 'on the case' has tended to help soothe the economy and the markets during past episodes."
By Friday, surveys of investors showed there was a nearly unanimous belief that the Fed would cut rates by at least a quarter-percentage-point at its March 17-18 meeting. That represents a sharp and sudden change from one week ago, when just 11 percent expected Fed action, according to the CME Group.
The shift comes as Capital Economics told clients that the continued spread of the disease in the United States, which has seen roughly 60 cases so far, "could be enough to tip the economy into a mild recession."
It's uncertain, though, how effective cutting interest rates might be. Economists call an episode like the epidemic or the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks an "exogenous shock," meaning an unpredictable development that arises from outside the economy or financial system yet has significant economic consequences.
The Fed normally acts only after assessing voluminous data on business and consumer activity, using sophisticated computer models that forecast the future by comparing current conditions to what's happened in the past. There is no recent precedent for the coronavirus outbreak for the Fed to use in its models.
Recessions can occur after the Fed has begun raising interest rates to head off incipient inflation, or after warning signs such as widespread layoffs or falling equipment orders. As the economy gradually deteriorates, the Fed can cut rates to encourage more spending. The White House and lawmakers, meanwhile, often support more spending or tax cuts to boost the economy. 
The coronavirus, which first emerged in China and has now spread to countries including South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran, Brazil and the United States, poses a unique challenge. In this case, the virus materialized with no warning and, after initially appearing to be confined to China, swept into roughly 60 countries.
Trump, who has been criticized for a delayed and uncertain response to the crisis, so far has given no hint of plans for any economic stimulus, but his aides are looking at a range of options.
China stands as a cautionary tale. The Chinese government's aggressive measures to fight the crisis, including imposing quarantines over an area that is home to perhaps 60 million people, chilled both supply and demand.
China's virus-fighting campaign prevented employees from leaving their homes and working on assembly lines, thus depressing the supply of goods. And it kept people from patronizing restaurants, movies or retail stores, thereby cutting demand.
If the United States suffers a serious outbreak and people stay home, fearing possible contagion, cutting interest rates would probably do little to persuade them to return to work or go out to shop or dine. "This is a very tough one for the Fed to deal with," said Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research.
The Fed has a long history of fighting financial and economic downturns, including the 1987 stock market plunge known as Black Monday and the Russian debt default more than a decade later. In 2008, after the collapse of the housing bubble, the Fed dropped interest rates to zero and held them there for years in a bid to resuscitate the U.S. economy.
The Fed moved quickly in the wake of 9/11 to try to limit the economic fallout. Six days later, with financial markets closed and smoke still curling from the World Trade Center rubble, then-Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan cut the benchmark U.S. lending rate by half a percentage point. The central bank also pumped $102 billion into the financial system to grease the gears of the economy and ease an anticipated slowdown, according to a subsequent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
Until Friday, Fed officials had been cautious in their public comments. Richard Clarida, the Fed's vice chairman, said earlier this week that the upheaval in China could reverberate through the global economy. "But it is still too soon to even speculate about either the size or the persistence of these effects, or whether they will lead to a material change in the outlook," he said in a speech to an economists conference in Washington.
For the past three years, the Fed has helped investors shrug off Trump's serial trade wars, cutting interest rates three times last year as inflation remained low.
Between Election Day in 2016 and Feb. 12 of this year, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 61 percent. In four days this week, it surrendered one-third of that gain as investors puzzled over what the virus will mean for corporate earnings.
By itself, this week's historic stock market meltdown - erasing nearly two years' worth of gains and incurring the fastest 10-plus-percent drop in history - highlights the current peril.
Economists are struggling to assess the extent of the calamity amid conflicting information about the virulence of the illness, the likely public reaction if it spreads in the United States and the potential response from the Fed or the Trump administration. To some, the profound uncertainty recalls the financial crash that hit the United States and Europe more than a decade ago.
"Forecasting in this environment feels eerily reminiscent of the crises - the ground keeps shifting beneath me as I try to gain my footing," Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, tweeted Thursday.
The cloudy outlook shows no signs of clearing anytime soon. On Friday, Fitch Solutions, a risk analysis firm, said it was revising down its forecasts for several European economies, including Germany, after already having lowered its Asian estimates.
One day earlier, Fitch said South Korea would grow by just 1.7 percent this year, down from its 2.2 percent original forecast. And that estimate could go lower, the firm said, citing the risk that "the outbreak will not be controlled by June."

cases in Oregon, two areas of calif.
CDC promises to provide more testing kits to states
California reported its second case of community transmission of the coronavirus Friday, and Oregon announced another just hours later, providing fresh evidence that the deadly virus is circulating in the United States. 
Authorities in Santa Clara County, Calif., said a 65-year-old woman had come down with the covid-19 disease without traveling to any countries hit hard by the outbreak or coming in contact with anyone known to have the infection. 
In Oregon, officials said a person from Washington County, in the northwest part of the state, had tested positive under similar circumstances. The positive test was conducted by the state's laboratory and is considered "presumptive" until it is confirmed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The unnamed Oregon individual spent time in an elementary school outside Portland and may have exposed students and staff there, state health authorities said. The school was ordered closed through Wednesday for cleaning, a local television station reported.
The developments mean the virus is spreading in at least three separate communities - two of them about 90 miles apart in California, and the third farther up the West Coast. On Wednesday, authorities revealed the nation's first case of community transmission, a woman in Solano County, Calif.
There is no apparent connection between the new California patient and anyone else with the disease, including the Solano County case and two previous cases in Santa Clara County, said Sara Cody, the Santa Clara County health officer.
"I think there's a strong possibility that there's local transmission going in California," said Jennifer Nuzzo, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. "In other words, the virus is spreading within California, and I think there's a possibility other states are in the same boat - they just haven't recognized that yet."
Two students in Palo Alto, a city of 67,000 in the northwestern corner of Santa Clara County, also may have been exposed to the virus, according to a letter to parents from the schools superintendent Friday.
The children are from the same family. One is in high school and the other is in middle school.
The school system said that "as a precautionary measure, the district immediately took action and the two students were sent home and will be excluded from attending school until we receive more information."
The virus that has been reported in 56 countries is now reaching into the heart of Silicon Valley, home to some of the world's largest technology companies - including Google, Apple and Tesla - and San Jose, a city of 1 million people. Santa Clara County is home to 2 million residents.
The three tech giants and other companies based in Santa Clara County did not respond to requests for comment on whether they are taking new precautions in response to the local case.
In a news release, Cody described the newly diagnosed Santa Clara County patient as "an older adult woman with chronic health conditions who was hospitalized for a respiratory illness."
The virus is known to cause more severe illness in older people and those with underlying illnesses such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. But the symptoms are milder in more than 80 percent of current patients.
Cody said at a news conference that the woman came to a hospital complaining of difficulty breathing. A physician treating her notified the county health department Wednesday evening because the patient's symptoms seemed compatible with covid-19. The doctor asked for a coronavirus test, which came back from the county's lab Thursday evening, Cody said.
Little else is known about the woman's case, including her condition or how long she was in the community while infectious.
In Oregon, officials were trying to determine the number of close contacts the patient had, to help determine the potential spread of the disease.
"Contact tracing is our top priority right now," said Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen.
The Oregon patient, whose age and gender were not disclosed, is at Kaiser Permanente Westside Medical Center in Hillsboro, health officials said.
To date, the virus - which originated in Wuhan, China - has sickened more than 84,000 people and has killed more than 2,800, mostly in China. Outbreaks in some places, such as South Korea, Iran and Italy, have been particularly severe.
Santa Clara health officials warned residents in a news release that "now is the time to prepare for the possibility of widespread community transmission." The county will be conducting surveillance to determine how widely the disease has spread, she said. 
"I understand this may be concerning to hear, but this is what we have been preparing for," Cody said. "Now we need to start taking additional actions to slow down the spread of the disease." 
Public health measures, such as contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, have helped slow the spread, she said, but other public health measures are now needed. 
"What we know now is the virus is here and present in some level," she said. "But we still don't know to what degree." 
On Tuesday, the CDC warned Americans to prepare for the inevitable spread of the virus in their communities. If transmission becomes more widespread, that could mean school closings, companies mandating telework and limits on or postponements of mass gatherings, said Nancy Messonnier, a top CDC official.
The CDC has also been under intense pressure to step up testing for the virus to determine how far the disease has spread. The agency promised Friday that it would be providing more test kits to states in coming days to allow for more rapid identification of infected people.
The discovery of two more cases "supports what we are trying to do with basic infection control and case identification," said Saskia Popescu, senior infection prevention epidemiologist for Honor Health, a hospital system in Phoenix. "We need to focus on pragmatic and scientifically based measures and not hit the panic button. We know how to protect ourselves."
Cody advised people to wash their hands and try not to touch their faces. Families should discuss supplies that might be needed if someone needs to stay home for a week or two. Schools should explore online learning, she said.
"I do understand the whole situation may feel overwhelming, and it's difficult to think about the possible disruption in our everyday lives, especially when we are still uncertain about what this may look like," she said. "But we do need everyone to start thinking about what actions they can take now so we can be prepared for the possibility of further spread of the virus in our community."

Major companies are beginning to cancel conferences and travel plans within the United States due to the coronavirus, which analysts warn will have cascading impacts on the country's hotels, airlines and convention centers.
International travel - particularly to Asia - has so far been the hardest-hit part of the industry, though analysts say that could soon change as fears of the coronavirus spread to Europe and North America. Hotels around the country have begun reporting a rise in group cancellations. Some air carriers, including Alaska Airlines and JetBlue Airways, are doing away with cancellation fees as jittery travelers rethink their plans.
"The cancellations are starting to move toward North America," said Scott Solombrino, executive director of the Global Business Travel Association, which estimates that the slowdown in global travel has already cost American businesses $7 billion this year. "Obviously the concern is that this will have a long-term impact on the U.S. economy."
Analysts said wide-scale cancellations - which so far have been concentrated in large cities such as New York, Washington and Los Angeles - are starting to hit smaller U.S. cities, as companies change their internal travel policies.
Workday called off a sales conference in Orlando scheduled for next week, while Google and Facebook canceled multiple events in California between March and May. And Amazon this week told employees to put off "nonessential travel" in the United States, though it did not offer details on what types of trips would qualify. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
Mounting cancellations, analysts said, are likely to have ripple effects throughout the economy, particularly for upscale hotels that rely on group bookings for about one-third of their sales, according to Jan Freitag, senior vice president of lodging insights for STR, a hospitality research firm.
"The most noticeable impact so far has been in group travel, with large conferences around the world being canceled," he said. "These large group conferences take years and years to plan. If they don't happen now, there is a good chance they won't happen at all."
Executives at Marriott International, the world's largest hotel chain, said this week that group bookings in the United States have started to take a hit. The Bethesda-based hospitality giant said much of the impact so far has been concentrated in Asia, where it has 800 hotels.
"To date, we have not yet seen a significant impact in the U.S., and our first quarter is off to a solid start, but the situation is fluid," Leeny Oberg, Marriott's chief financial officer, told CNBC on Wednesday. "We have seen a handful of citywide cancellations."
Booking Holdings, which owns Priceline, Booking.com and Kayak, said this week that it expects hotel room bookings to fell as much as 10 percent this quarter because of the coronavirus.
Shares of hotel companies and airlines plunged this week, as coronavirus-related fears led global markets to post their worst weekly losses since the Great Recession. Shares of Marriott and InterContinental Hotels Group fell about 9 percent apiece, while American Airlines and Jet Blue posted declines of more than 20 percent. Expedia Group, meanwhile, posted a 13 percent drop in share price.
"Every day we think we could be near a bottom, and every day we are not," Helane Becker, an airline industry analyst for Cowen, wrote in a note to clients this week. "The virus has spread, and the question is how much do people change their travel plans." 
Hostelling International USA, which oversees nearly 50 properties around the country, said group cancellations are on the rise. Individual travelers, though, are "so far going strong," spokeswoman Netanya Trimboli said.
The company is taking extra precautions by training employees on how to properly clean surfaces and encouraging them to stay home if they feel sick. New signs at its hostels remind guests to wash their hands and cough into their elbows.
Other hotels also report stalling demand, as Americans put off travel plans. But analysts say the largest impact on the hospitality market could come from a slowdown of Chinese visitors, who last year contributed $34 billion to the U.S. economy, according to Philadelphia-based Tourism Economics. Chinese visitors typically spend about $6,000 and spend an average of 15 nights in a hotel while in the United States, the firm said. It expects the number of Chinese travelers to the United States to drop by 25 percent this year.
"Right now there's a lot of uncertainty," said Adam Sacks, president of Tourism Economics. "It's shaping up to be very similar to SARS."
This time, he said, could be worse: Visits from China to the United States have grown nearly 13-fold since 2002, making a possible coronavirus outbreak much more devastating to the U.S. economy than the SARS epidemic was in 2003.
"Reservations are at a standstill," said Kim Lee, who handles sales at Arc The.Hotel, a boutique property in Washington's Foggy Bottom neighborhood.

Coronavirus panic tightened its grip on global markets Friday as the escalating outbreak drove stocks to their worst weekly loss since the 2008 financial crisis and prompted the Federal Reserve to take the unusual step of issuing a statement to reassure Americans.
The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 1,000 points early on, swinging widely throughout the session. It closed down 357 points, or 1.4 percent. The Standard &Poor's 500 index shed 0.8 percent, while the Nasdaq rallied to a flat finish.
The 10-year Treasury yield, a key marker in global finance, also hit a record low Friday, a sign investors are fleeing equities for the safety of bonds. The Cboe Volatility Index, known as the VIX, surged to its highest level since the Great Recession, signaling to investors that more volatility is ahead.
Friday's finish capped a blistering week on Wall Street. All three major U.S. indexes finished in correction, which signals a 10 percent reversal from recent highs and heightens investor worries of a runaway slide. The Dow and the S&P 500 had their worst weeks since the financial crisis, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
The Dow plunged 12 percent for the week, with American Express and Boeing among the biggest losers, shedding 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively. The S&P 500 lost 11.5 percent over the five days, while Nasdaq fell 10 percent. 
All 11 S&P 500 stock market sectors are in a correction, which means equity investors have no place to hide from the carnage. Energy and technology were among the worst hit.
Since Feb. 19, U.S. stocks have lost nearly $3.6 trillion in value.
As stocks nose-dived this week, calls have grown from prominent investors for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, a move that usually calms markets. Wall Street traders are now betting on at least three rate cuts this year, including one rate reduction when the Fed meets on March 18. Interest rates are just below 1.75 percent, a low level by historical standards, but higher than the rates in many other parts of the world.
Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said the central bank would take action if the economy takes a hit from the coronavirus.
Some investors were glad to see the end of February after days of stomach-churning slides.
"Investors had a love-hate relationship with risk in the month of February," said Kristina Hooper, chief market strategist at Invesco. "The first several weeks of the month saw investors embracing stocks. Then as worries grew about the coronavirus outbreak, market participants spent the past six trading days in panic mode. I suspect it will take reassurances from the Fed to stabilize markets."
Global markets also took a beating. In Japan, the Nikkei tumbled 3.7 percent as officials declared a state of emergency in the northern island of Hokkaido and doubts were cast about this summer's Tokyo Olympics. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dived 2.5 percent, and the Shanghai composite skidded 3.7 percent. European markets tipped into correction this week.
Oil prices dived as the global futures market broke below $50 per barrel, a closely watched number that signals whether oil companies and oil-producing countries can make profits.
Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the stock market's decline was not a concern for a big chunk of the population.
"Such a sharp market correction is, of course, a big deal," Bernstein said. "For the half of households who don't own stocks, what matters much more is the economic impact of the virus on their jobs and incomes. There are millions of workers who don't get paid if they can't go to work."

In Japan, anger over handling of epidemic

Government has
minimized the medical
crisis, critics contend
TOKYO - In Japan, it has been a case of see no virus, hear no virus, speak no virus. 
Or more to the point, don't test people for the novel coronavirus and perhaps the Olympics can still go ahead as planned.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is facing mounting anger over his government's handling of the epidemic, fueled this week by a sudden decision to ask schools to close in March.
But there is also frustration and unease that doctors simply cannot get patients tested for the pneumonia-like virus, a problem that may be causing a vast underreporting in cases of the illness and could become a global concern.
This is a repeat performance of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, critics say. They point to a political elite that reacts to damaging or embarrassing news by burying its head in the sand, sidelining critical experts and suppressing the facts - before finally being provoked by the unfolding disaster into taking extreme measures.
"It looks like Abe is sacrificing the public interest on the altar of the Olympics and is determined to prevent headlines of an escalating outbreak," said Jeff Kingston, a political science professor at Temple University at Japan. "He has shirked and shifted responsibility in a sluggish crisis response and has tried to bury the bad news just like they do in dictatorships."
Perhaps the biggest problem has been the lack of capability to conduct tests for the virus and the failure to sufficiently expand that capacity even two months into the epidemic, criticisms that have also been heard in the United States.
The Asahi newspaper has reported on many examples of patients who ran fevers for many days but could not obtain tests, including a man in his 60s who had a high temperature for 12 consecutive days and needed an oxygen inhaler but still could not get tested.
So widespread has the problem become that the Japan Medical Association issued a statement Wednesday asking for an investigation into cases in which doctors ordered tests that they deemed necessary, but public health centers refused to carry them out.
Japan initially limited tests to people who had developed symptoms and had traveled to China, or had come into close contact with an infected person. But it later expanded tests to people who had a fever for four consecutive days, or two days if the patient was elderly or pregnant. Many experts say those rules are too rigid but are not being respected because there are not enough tests for the novel coronavirus that causes the disease named covid-19.
The tests are also insufficiently sensitive, some experts say. They note that many former passengers from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship who tested negative in Japan have been tested positive in the United States, Australia, Hong Kong and Israel. 
Masahiro Kami, a doctor and executive director of the Medical Governance Research Institute in Tokyo, said people with mild symptoms are not being tested.
"Given that we get some 10 million cases of the influenza annually, I think there are probably already at least hundreds of thousands of cases in Japan," he said.
Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament he would look into the "stumbling blocks" over tests. He said Japan is capable of conducting 3,800 tests a day, yet carried out only 900 a day in the seven days from Feb. 18 to 24. South Korea is carrying out about 10,000 tests a day, one reason it has found 2,022 cases and Japan only 214.
Part of the problem is that Japan, unlike the United States, South Korea and China, has no Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
All the power is closely guarded by the Prime Minister's Office, and then by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, whose National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) has much less independence than centers for disease control in other countries. 
That structure leaves politicians and bureaucrats running the show rather than medical experts. The NIID has also been overwhelmed by the scale of the crisis, bureaucrats admit.
Japan's tendency to bury bad news was thrown into stark relief last week when a leading infectious disease expert recorded a widely watched video complaining of inadequate infection controls on board the Diamond Princess.
Within two days, Kentaro Iwata was forced to remove the video from YouTube in the face of a concerted attempt to undermine his claims and disparage his character, with one senior official calling him a "maverick" and "not a team player."
Stubbornly insisting that Iwata was wrong and that the 14-day quarantine on the Diamond Princess had been a success, Japan released hundreds of passengers back into the general population and refused to even test medical staff members who worked on the ship, even though at least eight officials, a medic and an ambulance driver had caught the virus.
A mounting tide of criticism and falling poll numbers may have prompted Abe to try to regain the initiative by asking schools to close this week. 
But the decision robs millions of parents and children of the chance to attend graduation ceremonies, as the academic year ends in March. It also creates headaches for parents who work and lack child-care options.
Public broadcaster NHK and the Kyodo News agency reported that Abe's request has sown "confusion" and anger. 
Kyodo quoted a senior official in the Education Ministry as being stunned by the announcement, which apparently came without consultation. A ruling party lawmaker was quoted as saying the party should urge Abe to retract it.
In the western Japanese city of Kyoto, the municipal education board said schools would open as normal on Monday, while a decision on how to proceed for the rest of the week would be made later.
The major of Chiba, a city near Tokyo, tweeted that the school closure "could result in a breakdown of Japanese society."
On Friday, Abe told parliament that his government plans to push ahead with the plan to close schools. He asked for understanding and called a news conference for Saturday evening.

Hong Kong Media Mogul Charged Over Protests as Authorities Target Pro-Democracy Figures; Police arrest Apple Daily newspaper founder Jimmy Lai, two opposition politicians for illegal assembly last summer

HONG KONG—Police swooped in at dawn to arrest a media tycoon and two other veteran pro-democracy figures who support the antigovernment protests, charging them with illegal assembly—six months after the fact.
Jimmy Lai, founder of the popular Apple Daily newspaper, known for criticizing and mocking China's leaders, was arrested Friday morning at his home, his newspaper said. Opposition politicians Lee Cheuk-yan and Yeung Sum were arrested separately, according to their parties.
Police said the arrests are related to an unauthorized march last Aug. 31 —a day burned in protesters' memories for how it ended: with police beating people inside subway trains, assaults filmed on phones and shared on social media. The 72-year-old Mr. Lai was also charged with criminal intimidation, relating to a 2017 case.
Authorities chose to hit the opposition movement when it is in a lull: The city is in a partial lockdown meant to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus , which causes a disease known as Covid-19. It has infected some 83,000 people world-wide and killed more than 2,800, mostly in neighboring China. Beijing recently replaced the heads of two of its key offices in semiautonomous Hong Kong, in what was seen as a sign of diminishing tolerance for dissent.
Mass street protests erupted in June, triggered by a proposed extradition law, and after the bill was pulled continued with further demands. They include greater democracy in choosing the city's chief executive and an independent inquiry into allegations of police brutality during the unrest.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam has shown no signs of yielding, and the police-watchdog agency has delayed its initial report on complaints against the force. The coronavirus outbreak has brought fresh criticism of Mrs. Lam , particularly complaints she was too slow to restrict visitors from mainland China . There are 94 cases of the coronavirus in Hong Kong.
Observers said simmering public anger could reignite street protests after virus fears subside, and criticized police for arresting people not responsible for organizing the Aug. 31 demonstration. An umbrella group called the Civil Human Rights Front had planned a major protest event that day, but canceled it after police denied permission.
Thousands gathered in the city's downtown anyway, and later in the day clashed with police. Late in the evening, police arrested people after forcibly removing them, some covered in blood, from a subway car stopped at a station.
The U.S. is concerned by their arrests, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said Friday, adding that they could have a chilling effect on freedom of expression in Hong Kong.
"We expect Hong Kong authorities not to use law enforcement selectively for political purposes, and to handle cases fairly and transparently," she said.
The arrests were "blatant acts of political suppression" by the Hong Kong government and Beijing, said Samuel Chu, managing director of the Washington, D.C.-based Hong Kong Democracy Council.
"It is the Hong Kong government's naked attempt to silence opposition voices and it will not work," he said. "The rights to assembly and protest are enshrined in Hong Kong's constitution."
The government didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. A police statement issued after the Aug. 31 demonstration severely condemned protesters, blaming them for escalating the violence.
A longtime and high-profile critic of the Chinese government, Mr. Lai founded Next Digital—originally Next Media—in the 1990s. It owns a number of publications in the region, including Apple Daily in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Some pro-democracy supporters see a subscription as a way to contribute to the protest movement. The Hong Kong edition has printed protest posters in the paper on some big demonstration days, such as July 1, the anniversary of the U.K.'s handover of the city to China.
Mr. Lai has been arrested before. In 2014, he was one of a number of pro-democracy lawmakers and activists detained following the Occupy Central movement, which paralyzed the city's downtown for almost three months. No charges were brought. Mr. Lai later stepped down as chairman of his media company, but remains the majority owner.
Mr. Lai met U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the White House last July to discuss the unpopular extradition bill and Hong Kong's autonomy under Beijing's "One Country, Two Systems" framework. He met Vice President Mike Pence on the same visit.
Mark Simon, a senior executive at Next Digital, said the arrests "didn't make sense," especially given the coronavirus.
"With all of the other problems that Hong Kong has, you really need high-profile arrests to stir the pot?" he said.
The police said they had filed the charges and released the three men on bail. A court hearing is scheduled for May.

Appeals Court Blocks Trump's Remain-in-Mexico Asylum Policy; More than 60,000 migrants seeking asylum have been sent back to Mexico to await U.S. court dates

A federal appeals court ruled the Trump administration must halt a policy of returning migrants along the southern U.S. border to Mexico while their requests for asylum in the U.S. are considered.
The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, on Friday ruled the policy was inconsistent with federal immigration law and U.S. international treaty obligations not to return aliens to countries where their life or freedom would be threatened due to their race, religion, nationality, or political or social affiliations.
The court, in its 2-to-1 ruling, said its decision applied to the entire southern U.S. border, citing the need for uniform immigration rules. Because the policy "is invalid in its entirety…it should be enjoined in its entirety," Judge William Fletcher, a Clinton appointee, wrote for the court.
The ruling is a considerable setback for the Trump administration because it said the "Remain in Mexico" policy was one of its most effective in slowing the wave of asylum seekers arriving at the southern border from Central America and elsewhere.
Illegal border crossings have fallen more than 75% since their peak in May, around the time when the administration vastly expanded "Remain in Mexico" along the border.
The administration signaled in court papers late Friday that it will seek Supreme Court review.
The White House described the decision as "another reckless nationwide injunction threatening our constitutional structure."
In a statement, press secretary Stephanie Grisham said that the remain-in-Mexico policy had been a success and that the court's decision aggravated the threat of coronavirus.
"If today's ruling is allowed to stand, these successes will be reversed, which threatens to flood the Nation's immigration system, present unchecked coronavirus entry risk, deeply damage our positive relationship with the Government of Mexico and other regional partners, and reignite the humanitarian and security crisis at the border," she said.
The decision marked a shift for the appeals court, which had issued a preliminary ruling last May that allowed the administration to implement the policy until the court reached its final decision. Joining Judge Fletcher was Judge Richard Paez, also a Clinton appointee. In dissent, Judge Ferdinand Fernandez, a George H.W. Bush appointee, said the court should have been bound by its earlier decision.
The "Remain in Mexico" policy, formally called the Migrant Protection Protocols, made its debut in January 2019 as the Trump administration sought alternatives to releasing families seeking asylum into the U.S., where they were permitted to live for months, and often years, as their cases made their way through backlogged immigration courts.
In the past year, the government has sent more than 60,000 migrants seeking asylum back across the border, where they were required to wait in violent Mexican border cities for months for U.S. court dates.
Many migrants who have been returned—estimated at about half, according to recent data—simply drop their claims before they are decided.

The arrival of throngs of Central American and other Spanish-speaking migrants has created humanitarian crises in several of the cities where they have been waiting. In Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville, Texas, about 3,000 migrants set up a tent camp along the border with the U.S. , where many of the migrants said they felt safest.
Matamoros is one of the largest cities in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, which has received a "do not travel" danger warning from the State Department, on par with countries like Afghanistan and Syria.
There have been more than 1,000 reported cases of kidnapping, rape, torture and other violent crimes against migrants returned to Mexico, according to Human Rights First, an organization that interviews victims in border cities and advocates for migrants' due process rights.
Advocates said migrants being returned became targets for local crime cartels, because many of them have relatives in the U.S. who could be pressured to pay a ransom for their release.
Legal challengers in the case included asylum seekers as well as nonprofit groups. "Although the ruling cannot repair the profound pain and suffering that MPP has caused over this last year, we are hopeful the United States can once again stand as a safe haven for the persecuted," said Blaine Bookey, legal director of the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies, one of the challengers.
The policy faced unusual criticism from within the government. The union of asylum officers charged with determining whether someone should be sent to Mexico wrote a friend-of-the-court brief denouncing the policy.
In September, the Supreme Court separately allowed Trump administration to begin enforcing a new rule making migrants ineligible for asylum if they passed through any other countries en route to the U.S. and didn't ask for U.S. asylum in those countries.
But migrants from Central America and elsewhere are allowed to apply for humanitarian protection in the U.S., and the law still permits them to win a lesser form of relief known as withholding of removal.
The Trump administration is unlikely to begin releasing migrants it would have returned to Mexico into the U.S.
Fearing a court could halt the "Remain in Mexico" program, the administration created several other avenues to deport asylum seekers quickly. Some have been sent to Guatemala under a "safe third country" agreement, while others have been placed in a program called the Prompt Asylum Claim Review that allows the government to quickly deport migrants it determines don't meet the criteria for asylum.
These alternative programs—which are also both being challenged in court—are likely to swell in coming weeks.

China Purchasing Indexes Drop to Record Lows as Epidemic Stalls Output; Factory and nonfactory figures tumble to levels below readings during financial crisis

BEIJING—Official gauges of China's factory and nonfactory activity plunged to record lows in February as the nation's economy struggled to resume normal production as it faced the coronavirus epidemic.
The official manufacturing purchasing managers index tumbled to 35.7 in February from 50 in January, indicating a deep contraction. February's reading from the National Bureau of Statistics on Saturday was the first official data for a full month of economic activity in China since the coronavirus began affecting the economy in late January.
The index dropped to 38.8 in November 2008, when the financial crisis prompted steep losses on Wall Street and sent shockwaves through the global economy. The 50 mark separates expansion from contraction.
Adding to the gloom, China's nonmanufacturing PMI, also released on Saturday, sank to a record low of 29.6 in February from 54.1 in January. The nonmanufacturing PMI covers such services as retail, aviation and software as well as real estate and construction.
The factory index indicated contraction for most of 2019, hit by a trade war between the U.S. and China. It didn't cross back into expansion until late last year, when trade tensions between the two sides eased .
The February result came in far below the median forecast of 43 by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. Purchasing by manufacturers is a leading indicator of business activity because factories buy supplies in anticipation of demand.
Saturday's results show a "relatively large impact" from the epidemic, Zhao Qinghe, an analyst with the statistics bureau, said in a statement accompanying the data release. March's readings should improve because of authorities' efforts to help companies, especially manufacturing firms, resume production, he said.
January's factory reading of 50—indicating neither expansion nor contraction—didn't fully reflect the impact of the epidemic since the previous month's official survey was completed by Jan. 20.
President Xi Jinping made his first public remarks about the disease that day, and economic activity ground to a halt across the country after authorities locked down Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the epidemic, on Jan. 23.
While February's reading reflects the first full month in which the outbreak was widely known, it also overlaps with the Lunar New Year period, which regularly distorts economic activity in the first two months of the year, depending on when it falls in the Western calendar.
In anticipation of the jolt awaiting businesses in China, Beijing has rolled out measures to help companies restore operations, including cutting rents and social insurance payments and increasing lending to small firms.
The central bank lowered benchmark lending rates earlier this month while offering large amounts of liquidity to the financial system so banks can lend more to businesses hit hard by the epidemic. China's cabinet on Tuesday cut taxes for small businesses and ordered state-owned banks to issue more cheap loans while offering longer grace periods for borrowers to repay loans.
Despite Beijing's efforts to help restore normal production, the pace of work resumption has been slow as employers and workers remain wary of the disease.
Economists are still waiting for March's numbers before they have a clean reading of the economic impact without the distortions of the Lunar New Year. Many economists and investors, meanwhile, have turned to alternative gauges of business activity, including coal consumption at major power plants, home sales and port traffic, measuring exports. All indicate that economic activity hasn't returned to pre-Lunar New Year levels.
Saturday's data pointed to slack throughout the economy. The production subindex of the purchasing managers index plunged to 27.8 from 51.3 in January. The new-export-orders subindex, a gauge of external demand, dropped to 28.7 in February from 48.7 in January. A component of the index measuring imports fell to 31.9 from January's 49.
One of the biggest obstacles to restarting production is finding enough workers to return to factories. The employment component of the index, which measures the staffing situation, decreased to 31.8 in February from 47.5 during the previous month.
"Most migrant workers are still not back from their hometowns," said Yan Juanjuan, a recruiter at Shenzhen-based Sanhe Human Resources Market, one of China's largest job markets for manual laborers.
Unlike state-owned companies, it is difficult for the owners of small factories to find laborers, Ms. Yan said, adding that the job market remains largely stagnant.
Part of the problem is that Shenzhen municipal authorities aren't permitting large gatherings in a bid to stave off further infection—and the job market still relies on large crowds of migrant workers congregating in large, crowded halls to peruse job offers posted on walls. China's state-owned employers, meanwhile, tend to be more resourceful and can afford to hire more locals than private employers can.

Federal Reserve Will 'Act as Appropriate to Support the Economy'; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signals central bank is prepared to cut interest rates if needed

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled Friday the central bank was prepared to cut interest rates if needed.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's Statement 
"The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity," Mr. Powell said in a statement released Friday afternoon. "The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook. We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."
The Fed used similar language last June to indicate it was prepared to cut interest rates if needed after the U.S.-China trade war threatened to aggravate a global slowdown. The central bank subsequently cut interest rates three times , most recently in October to a range between 1.5% and 1.75%.
The sharp market selloff this week is forcing the Fed to consider whether and when to cut interest rates to cushion the U.S. economy against the effects of a widening global slowdown due to coronavirus outbreaks in dozens of countries.
Fed officials have been trying to avoid either waiting too long to respond to an unclear economic threat and or acting too rashly, which could further undermine confidence.
Markets have painted the central bank into a corner. Just a few days ago, when the virus outbreak appeared limited mostly to China, investors in interest-rate future markets thought the Fed would cut rates by the summer.
Now, as outbreaks have spread on other continents, investors expect the Fed to cut interest rates by at least a quarter percentage point—and possibly more—at their March 17-18 meeting, if not sooner.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been down as much as 3.7% in trading Friday, rallied somewhat after the Fed issued the statement, with stocks down 2% about an hour before markets were set to close.
Stocks were set for their biggest weekly losses since 2008 after fears of coronavirus outbreaks on multiple continents led investors to re-evaluate the prospect for a temporary slowdown in growth in China.

A recovery in the U.S. freight transport market is looking further away. Analysts expect supply-chain disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak to prolong a slump in domestic shipping demand that began last year, the WSJ Logistics Report's Jennifer Smith writes, although freight carriers could see a bump once production in China rebounds and companies rush to restock depleted inventories. The impact of China's slowdown on U.S. shipping markets shows how even companies focused on domestic business are closely tied to global supply chains, The sharp decline in shipping volumes through U.S. West Coast ports is rolling across distribution networks, with intermodal rail transport down sharply so far this year and trucking rates weakening on tepid demand. UBS cut its earnings outlook for the current quarter for both United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. More downbeat reports are likely until there are clear signs of a rebound emerge.
ECONOMY &TRADE
The nation's longest expansion on record may teeter if the U.S. suffers a serious coronavirus outbreak. Economists believe the country is well insulated from a potential epidemic. But the WSJ's Eric Morath and Harriet Torry report the country is already feeling the impact of the outbreaks in China and more recently in Italy , although the U.S. has the advantage of months of warning to prepare. One economist says U.S. transportation networks would grind to a halt but that an epidemic wouldn't trigger a recession. Meantime, companies around the world are assessing the outbreak's impact on their balance sheets, the WSJ's Nina Trentmann and Mark Maurer report, with the decline in shipping slicing freight operators' revenues and potentially hitting liquidity. Danish freight forwarder DSV Panalpina A/S this week raised $544 million through a bond sale that wasn't connected to the coronavirus. But finance chief Jens Lund says, "Sometimes you get lucky."
SUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES
Auto-parts suppliers aren't waiting for the end of the coronavirus outbreak to start restocking their customers' inventories. Some auto makers that normally ship by ocean are already turning to airfreight to keep production lines moving, the WSJ's Mike Colias reports, a pricier alternative that highlights the big stakes for manufacturers working with tight supply chains and expensive parts . Several suppliers are warning their auto manufacturing customers of potential parts shortages. Razat Gaurav, chief executive of supply-chain analytics firm LLamasoft, says some car companies and auto-parts suppliers have chartered airplanes or booked space on freighters to fly parts directly across the Pacific. Toyota Motor says some of its North American suppliers are shipping smaller components from China by plane while Nissan Motor plans to book freighter space to ship key parts. That's an expensive alternative to ocean transport, but pales next to the cost of idling a factory.

Europe's Face-Off With China; Countries that once saw Xi Jinping as a possible ally on global issues now find themselves resisting Beijing's authoritarian sway

Just three years ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping skillfully soothed European sensibilities at the annual gathering of global elites in Davos, Switzerland, as he praised the virtues of multilateralism, free trade and fighting climate change.
To many Europeans, China's authoritarian leader briefly seemed a more appealing partner than President Donald Trump, who has since withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate treaty, disparaged the European Union and questioned the value of NATO. Mr. Xi's ambitious Belt and Road project also made European politicians salivate over tens of billions of dollars in anticipated Chinese infrastructure investments.
That infatuation is waning, however, as Europe confronts China's rise as a superpower and attempts to navigate a new international order that is shaped more and more by the rivalry between Washington and Beijing. China's appeal has been further eroded by the secretive manner in which Chinese authorities initially managed the outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus, which this week became a public-health emergency in Italy and a threat to other European economies.
Increasingly repressive at home under Mr. Xi, the Chinese party-state is now trying to stifle public criticism abroad, including in Europe. In recent months, these heavy-handed attempts to influence, and sometimes bully, European nations have triggered a backlash, drawing attention to the Chinese system's fundamental difference with Western democracies.
"China is trying to export its governance model across the word, including into Europe," said Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, a think tank that advises Germany's government and parliament. "Europe is waking up to dealing with China not only as a customer, a marketplace and a big factory, but as a geopolitical and geoeconomic actor that is certainly a partner in many respects but also a competitor and a challenger, including to our values."
Positive views of China shrank in much of the EU last year, according to opinion polls. In Sweden, one of several European countries experiencing this new chill with Beijing, things have gotten so nasty recently that three major parties have demanded the expulsion of the Chinese ambassador to Stockholm, citing his public threats to Swedish officials, media and human-rights groups. "Some Swedish businesses now have to take into account Swedish public opinion: 'Why do you do business in China, such a terrible country?' That is quite new," said Lars Freden, a former Swedish ambassador to Beijing.
Europe's expected Belt and Road bonanza, meanwhile, has by and large failed to materialize as China's own economy has slowed down—troubles that began well before the stringent measures to contain the coronavirus. "The period of romantic optimism is over," said Latvia's Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics. "Four years ago it was only about the economy, about trade, about the Belt and Road, about more investment. Now, it is more balanced."
A fellow minister from a major EU nation put it less diplomatically. "Frankly, we see no reason why we should be kneeling to China," he said. "They are not doing us any favors."
China remains vital to the European economy, of course, and retains a network of influence on the continent. Bilateral trade stood at €604 billion ($665 billion) in 2018, the last year for which EU statistics are available, with a €185 billion deficit ($203 billion) in China's favor. Chinese companies have invested heavily in key pieces of Europe's infrastructure, like Greece's main port of Pireaus and Portugal's power utility, and control iconic European manufacturers such as Sweden's Volvo Cars and Italy's Pirelli.
Distracted by dealing with Russia and with Britain's departure from the bloc, the EU is only now attempting to put together a coherent policy on China. Perennial rivalries within the EU, where smaller states often suspect Germany and France of skewing the rules in their own favor, have complicated the process.
Still, last March, the European Commission for the first time defined China as a "systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance"—a departure from the previous approach that viewed China mostly through the lens of lucrative trade opportunities. European leaders are working to come up with a common position ahead of the summit between Mr. Xi and 27 EU leaders scheduled for September in the German city of Leipzig.
As this new attitude sets in, the overriding priority for Europe is to avoid getting trampled by the two superpowers, EU officials say. "We Europeans cannot accept the idea that the world should organize itself around a new Sino-American bipolarity which would come to replace, after a 30-year transition period, the Soviet-American bipolarity that literally divided Europe," said the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell.
Europe's sudden awakening to China's growing clout, and to Beijing's threat to its democratic values, is happening at a time of profound discord with the U.S. Mr. Trump remains deeply unpopular in European nations, in part because of his threats of a trade war. At home, however, his desire to contain China has bipartisan support, which means that the pressure on Europe to take sides is almost certain to continue whether or not Mr. Trump wins a second term in November.
"We have two main worries now. Are we still allies with the U.S.? And where is China heading with its authoritarian turn?" said France's former prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, who informally advises President Emmanuel Macron. "What's at stake for us is to become strong enough that we don't turn into a ping-pong ball hit by the American and Chinese rackets."
While European leaders agree, in principle at least, that Europe's best response to this challenge is to grow its own capacities—in defense, technology, industry and diplomacy—there are two main schools of thought on the best strategy to achieve that goal.
One asserts that, regardless of the EU's many disagreements with Mr. Trump, trans-Atlantic ties are more essential than ever before and Europe should stand firmly by America's side. "The U.S. is not able to deal with China alone, and Europe is not able to deal with China alone," said Latvia's Mr. Rinkevics. "If you look at it from the values point of view, from the strategic point of view, the U.S. should be our number one partner in addressing these issues, even though it's not an easy partner."
To other European leaders, however, this approach is rooted in wishful thinking. The U.S., they argue, already began disengaging from Europe under President Barack Obama, and EU interests are increasingly at odds with Washington's. This means that Europe should stay out of the fight and pursue its own course.
France's President Macron has pressed this point, insisting on greater "strategic autonomy" for Europe and arguing for renewed engagement with Russia to limit China's power. Such thinking reflects a major shift, from seeing Russia as Europe's biggest security threat, in the wake of the 2014 invasion of Ukraine, to realizing that China poses an even more severe challenge—economically, politically and even militarily.
The surprisingly rapid expansion of China's military base in Djibouti—a former French colony on the Horn of Africa—has enabled China to project power in Europe's own neighborhood. To France, this point was made clear in July 2017, when Chinese warships sailing in the Mediterranean briefly outnumbered those of the French Navy.
Chinese officials, in their meetings with Europeans, insist that Beijing's intentions are nothing but benign. "The world today needs solidarity and cooperation between China and Europe," Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at the Munich Security Conference in February. "China-EU cooperation has become even more significant, especially in today's world where a certain major country has abandoned international cooperation and pursued unilateralism. China always believes that for China and the EU, our areas of consensus outweigh differences."
Such assurances meet an increasingly skeptical response, however, in part because of a new pattern of behavior by Chinese government representatives. These days in Europe, public discussion of matters such as the treatment of the Uighur minority in Xinjiang, protests in Hong Kong or the Chinese authorities' initial mishandling of the Wuhan coronavirus often prompts angry public interventions by Chinese diplomats. From Stockholm to Prague to Rome, the Chinese message is: Keep quiet or your economies will suffer.
In the Czech Republic, China responded to plans by the mayor of Prague to foster cooperation with Taiwan by canceling a 14-city tour by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra scheduled for last fall and by blocking subsequent visits of several other cultural institutions based in the city.
Despite frequent threats, Beijing has stopped short of imposing serious economic sanctions, in part because such a step against any individual EU nation would likely invite retaliation from the entire EU.
So far, at least, China's new bullying approach seems to be backfiring. That's especially the case on the issue that currently matters most to Beijing: whether to allow its Huawei telecom giant to play a significant role in building Europe's 5G networks. The U.S. is lobbying hard to keep Huawei's cheaper equipment out of European networks. "Huawei and other state-backed Chinese companies are Trojan horses for Chinese intelligence," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in Munich.
Huawei insists that it is independent from the Chinese Communist Party and last year sued French researchers who alleged otherwise. At the same time, however, China's ambassador to Berlin has issued implicit threats of targeting the German car industry if Huawei is excluded.
Such Chinese pressure ignited a rebellion against Chancellor Angela Merkel's relatively soft approach to Huawei within her own CDU party. A CDU position paper published this month calls for limiting participation in 5G by "untrustworthy" suppliers that are beholden to a foreign state, and a cross-party alliance of government and opposition lawmakers now wants to ban companies like Huawei from Germany's 5G system. The final 5G legislation is still being drafted.
"It tells you something if official representatives of another state dare to interfere in a parliamentary process of legislation," said Norbert Rottgen, who heads the foreign-affairs committee in the German parliament and is running to succeed Ms. Merkel at the helm of the CDU. "This requires us to send a strong signal that we take our own decisions."
In France, the biggest mobile operator, Orange, already announced in January that it won't use Huawei equipment.
In Italy, which became the first big Western nation to join the Belt and Road initiative just last March, the mood on China has also soured, in part because of similar bullying attempts by Beijing. In November, a handful of Italian lawmakers decided to hold a videoconference with Joshua Wong, a leader of the Hong Kong protesters. The Chinese embassy in Rome blasted the plan as a "grave error and irresponsible behavior" that "supports violence and crime."
That attempt to scuttle a parliamentary event prompted all the main political parties as well as Italy's foreign ministry to condemn Chinese meddling. Days later, the Italian parliament's lower house unanimously passed a resolution supporting democratic freedoms in Hong Kong.
Nowhere in Europe is the backlash against China as strong as in Sweden, however. According to Pew, the number of people with a favorable opinion of China declined by 8 percentage points to 33% in France last year, by 11 points to 36% in the Netherlands and by 5 points to 34% in Germany. In Sweden, the favorable rating of China sank to 25% in 2019 from 42% the year before.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What should Europe do to better exert influence on China? Join the conversation below.
Sweden's troubles with China began in 2015, when a Chinese-born Swedish citizen, Gui Minhai, disappeared on a trip to Thailand. A publisher once based in Hong Kong, Mr. Gui angered Chinese authorities by writing about alleged corruption in the family of Mr. Xi and other subjects considered taboo in Beijing.
Swedish officials say that Mr. Gui was kidnapped by Chinese operatives. Beijing says that the publisher turned himself in voluntarily to Chinese police to stand trial for a 2003 drunken-driving episode that resulted in the death of a young woman and, after his release two years later, was rearrested for "illegally providing state secrets and intelligence."
The controversy turned into a crisis last November when Sweden's PEN Center drew attention to Mr. Gui's plight by awarding him the prestigious Tucholsky literary prize, which is usually delivered by the country's culture minister. The decision drew a livid response from China's ambassador to Stockholm, Gui Congyou, whose outbursts have made him a household name in the country. "Normal exchanges and cooperation will be seriously hindered," especially if Swedish officials attended the ceremony, he warned. "Some people in Sweden shouldn't feel at ease after hurting the feelings of the Chinese people."
Sweden's government ignored the warning and the culture minister delivered the prize anyway, at a ceremony where an empty chair was left for the jailed publisher. On Tuesday, a court in China's Ningbo city said that Mr. Gui has been sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment.
Such brushes with an increasingly intolerant, and self-confident, new China offer a sobering lesson to all Western democracies, according to Jesper Bengtsson, the chairman of the Swedish PEN Center. "We always used to talk about the spread of democracy and universal values, and about how we can affect change in countries like China from a position of strength," Mr. Bengtsson said. "We now realize that we are not necessarily the strong party here. There has been a shift of power in the world."

This week's rally in U.S. government bonds picked up new momentum Friday, reflecting investors' intense demand for safer assets and escalating bets that the Federal Reserve will move quickly and aggressively to cut interest rates.
The yield on the 10-year note settled at 1.127%, according to Tradeweb, breaking the previous record-low close of 1.296% set a day earlier.
Falling even more sharply, the yield on the two-year note logged its largest one-day decline since Oct. 2008 to finish at 0.878%, compared with 1.099% Thursday.
Yields fall when bond prices rise.
Analysts said the steep decline of the two-year yield, which is particularly sensitive to changes in monetary policy, reflected growing confidence among traders that the Fed will cut interest rates to stem market turmoil caused by the coronavirus.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a statement Friday afternoon that the "coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity" and that the central bank would "act as appropriate to support the economy."
Just a week ago, federal-funds futures, which traders use to bet on the path of central-bank policy, showed an 89% chance that the Fed would keep interest rates unchanged at its March 17-18 meeting, according to CME Group data. Shortly after Mr. Powell's statement, traders saw a 4% chance of a 0.25 percentage-point cut and a 96% chance of a 0.5 percentage-point cut.
Earlier in the day, some investors had speculated that the Fed could even cut rates before its next meeting.
Though the next meeting is just weeks away, "I'm not sure they can go that long," said Bill Zox, chief investment officer of fixed income at Diamond Hill Capital Management.
Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer at the Leuthold Group, also said the Fed will likely cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage point before the March meeting because of its sensitivity to market sentiment.
Some of the decline in Treasury yields was a response to uncertainty abroad in Europe and Asia, where the virus has had a more direct impact—disrupting travel and commerce. European government bond yields dipped across the board Friday, with the 10-year German bund falling as low as minus 0.624%—below the short-term interest rates set by the European Central Bank of minus 0.5%.
Investors unwilling to hold negative-yielding European debt often move into relatively higher-yielding U.S. bonds, causing yields to fall there as well.
The rally has dropped longer-term yields below shorter-term ones, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve that is often seen as a harbinger for a coming recession.
Some economists have argued, however, that U.S. Treasurys don't offer as clear a signal of recessions as in past years due to more globalized markets and post-2008 financial-crisis monetary-policy measures such as quantitative easing, in which central banks have bought government bonds .
"For a recession in the U.S. you would need to see consumer confidence fall lower," said Vivek Bommi, senior portfolio manager, noninvestment-grade credit at Neuberger Berman in London. "You would need to derail the consumer, and that's the big question that everyone's grappling with."
The decline in U.S. Treasury yields had been more pronounced than in European government bonds. This was because the Fed has greater headroom to cut interest rates relative to the European Central Bank where rates are already negative.
"The Fed is capable of doing much more—it has more room away from the lower bound of monetary policy," Mr. Jones said.
The benchmark 10-year German bund is still more than 0.1 percentage point from its all-time low, touched last year, notes Eric Brard, global head of fixed income at Amundi Asset Management in Paris.
"From that perspective there is room for further decline. We need to assess how long and deep and strong the shock might be going forward," he said.
In a sign of the disquiet the coronavirus is causing in financial markets, Italian and Greek yields rose, as investors feared the impact on two of Europe's weakest economies. The yield on the Greek 10-year bond rose to 1.322% Friday after hitting a record closing low of 0.950% two weeks ago. Expectations of a long-awaited economic rebound in Greece have now been put on hold because of the virus outbreak.
"Let's just say the hunt for yield is currently on pause. People are moving toward safety. It's not something we haven't seen before," said Dimitris Dalipis, head of fixed income at Alpha Trust Investments, based in Athens. "It's like a textbook correction."

Canada Eked Out Growth in Fourth Quarter; Weakest quarterly performance in over three years fueled by export, business investment declines; fear of repeat in first quarter of 2020

OTTAWA—The Canadian economy barely grew in the final three months of 2019, as declines in exports and business investment contributed to the weakest quarter of activity in over three years.
Some market watchers fear another weak performance could be in store for early 2020, as the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy and rail blockades on key commercial corridors subtract from Canadian growth. Pressure is mounting on the Bank of Canada to act, and some economists believe it will do so next week with an interest-rate cut.
Canada's gross domestic product, or the broadest measure of goods and services produced in an economy, increased at a 0.3% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, to 2.100 trillion Canadian dollars ($1.571 trillion), Statistics Canada said Friday. That matched both market expectations and the Bank of Canada's most recent quarterly economic forecast.
Third-quarter GDP was revised down, to 1.1% annualized growth from a previous 1.3% estimate. The 0.3% gain in the fourth quarter was the weakest three-month period of economic output since the second quarter of 2016, when activity contracted because of wildfires that temporarily shutdown production in the heart of Canada's energy-producing region.
Overall, Canada's economy grew 1.6% in 2019, a deceleration after a 2% advance in 2018. In comparison, U.S. GDP increased 2.3% last year.
"While it's tempting to dismiss the fourth-quarter figure since the world has changed so rapidly in recent weeks, the key point is that the economy already had precious little momentum heading into the new year, and was thus more vulnerable to a downside shock," said Douglas Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
In its last economic update in January, the Bank of Canada projected a recovery in the first quarter of 2020, with growth of 1.3% annualized. More economists are now skeptical, given the disruptions in the global supply chain stemming from the coronavirus epidemic. Concerns about the spread of the coronavirus outside of China, in countries such as South Korea and Italy, and the impact on growth have fueled a deep selloff this week in equities. Global stock-market indexes are on pace for their biggest one-week drops since the financial crisis in the fall of 2008.
"At this point, it is impossible to know how large and long-lasting these effects will be, but their implications for Canadian exports and consumer and business confidence are clearly negative," said the monetary-policy committee of the C.D. Howe Institute, a leading Canadian think tank. The committee recommends the Bank of Canada cut its main interest rate next week and again in April to mitigate the fallout.
Exacerbating the situation in Canada were a series of rail blockades in February by antipipeline protesters, including one in eastern Canada that crippled freight- and passenger-rail traffic on a major east-to-west corridor for over two weeks. Economists say the stoppages threaten to shave 0.1% to 0.3% from economic output in February.
Sebastien Lavoie, chief economist at Laurentian Bank Securities in Montreal, said he's predicting flat growth again for Canada in the first quarter.
In the fourth quarter, exports declined 1.3% on a nonannualized basis and business investment fell 0.8%. Capital spending among businesses is expected to remain weak through 2020, according to a survey this week from Statistics Canada measuring investment expectations. Meanwhile, housing spending climbed 0.5%, matching the growth in the prior quarter.
Final domestic demand -- which captures household and government spending, along with business investment -- rose 0.2% in the fourth quarter, a deceleration from 0.8% growth in the previous three-month period.
The data agency said economic activity in the October-to-December period was weighed down by the shutdown of the Keystone pipeline, unfavorable harvest conditions, a strike at the country's largest railroad, and another strike in the U.S. affecting motor-vehicle and parts production at General Motors Co.
One bright spot was growth in December. GDP in the month grew 0.3% from November, with 15 of 20 industrial sectors tracked recording growth.

U.S. Household Income Jumped, Consumer Spending Edged Higher in January

WASHINGTON—Household income rose solidly in January and consumer spending edged higher, while inflation remained in check, signs of stability for the U.S. economy at the start of the year.
Personal-consumption expenditures, or household spending, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in January from December, the Commerce Department said Friday. Personal income advanced 0.6% last month, the largest gain in 11 months. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 0.2% increase in spending and a 0.4% gain in personal income.
Friday's data reflects income, spending and prices measured in January, before heightened concerns about the coronavirus caused U.S. officials to issue warnings.
Gains in income and spending came against the backdrop of still-modest inflation pressures. The price index for personal-consumption expenditures, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 0.1% on the month and was up 1.7% from a year earlier.
Year-over-year price gains have edged up in the past two months, reflecting higher energy costs than in early 2019. The annual increase in the personal-consumption-expenditures price index was 1.5% in December and 1.3% in November.
Still, inflation is running below the Fed's 2% target, and January's data suggested the recent acceleration could prove temporary. The coronavirus outbreak in China and other countries has eased global demand for oil and other goods in recent weeks.
Crude oil prices dipped below $50 a barrel this week from more than $60 a barrel in early January.
The core personal-consumption expenditures index, which excludes often-volatile prices for food and energy, was up 0.1% on the month and rose 1.6% in January from a year earlier.
The January gain in incomes was broad based. Wages and salaries increased 0.5% from the prior month, which reflects both the minimum wage increasing in 21 states to start the year and a tight labor market putting some upward pressure on wages across the income spectrum. Meanwhile, government payments rose 1.6% in a month Social Security benefits increased. Personal dividend income rose 1.1% in January.
Americans' increased outlays on long-lasting durable goods by 0.6% in January. Households reduced spending on other goods but increased spending on services, such as health care, by 0.3%.
January's rise in spending was at a slower rate than the upwardly revised 0.4% increase in December. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total U.S. economic output, and was viewed as a key support last year for the broader economy, which grew at a 2.1% rate in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Commerce Department said Thursday.
Whether the economy can maintain that rate of growth will largely depend on whether consumers remain willing to spend. Stock market gyrations and concerns about the coronavirus could impact consumers' confidence in the short term, but for all of 2020, economists expect the economy to grow at a similar rate as in 2019. The Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence for February, released Tuesday, rose slightly from January.

Bond Bulls Have Time in the Sun, While Fed Put Gets Roughed Up; Central bank has less firepower now to combat a downturn than in the past

Any expectation that the coronavirus epidemic would bypass the U.S. stock market disappeared this week as stocks careened. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 1,000 points on Monday, and then fell nearly 1,200 points on Thursday as all the major indexes tumbled into correction territory . The Dow's six-session losing streak is its worst since November 2008. Meanwhile, haven assets like bonds and gold continue to see money piling in, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note setting a record low.
Here's a look at this week's big winners and losers.
WINNER: Bond Bulls
When the stock market and the bond market are both rallying, it is usually a sign that somebody is working off the wrong narrative. Either stock jockeys are too optimistic, or bond bulls are too pessimistic.
Then a week like this one happens. While stocks dropped sharply, government-bond yields tumbled to new lows. For bond bulls who have endured the jibes of the buy-risk crowd, it was a moment to vaunt.
"Today will go down as the greatest day in my firm's history," said JC Parets, who runs research firm All Star Charts, on Monday. It wasn't just the gains in the bond market, he said. At the end of January, Mr. Parets warned his several thousand clients to get out of stocks, completely, and buy bonds. That anti-risk call got him a lot of grief, he said.
A registered chart technician, he says he saw more problems for equities than the coronavirus alone. There was rampant buying of call options, meaning speculators were betting on the market rising, along with wild trading of stocks like Tesla Inc. Copper fell and gold rose. Regional banks, which generally perform worse in a low-rate environment, rolled over, while REITs, which generally perform well in the same environment, rallied. All of it, he said, pointed in one direction: Rates were going lower. And so, he felt, were stocks.
Stock selloffs are usually sharp and short, compared with uptrends. The question now is, how short? Mr. Parets took his victory lap, but says he doesn't see this week as the end of the race. "I haven't taken any profits, and I'm not telling my clients to," he said. "I'm not seeing any evidence that this is it."
LOSER: The Fed Put
Whether it is the coronavirus epidemic, the U.S.-China trade war or recession fears, there has been one consistent rallying point for U.S. stocks: the "Fed put," the idea that the Federal Reserve will keep rates low to boost the stock market.
To be clear, the Fed itself has never endorsed this notion, but it isn't an outlandish conclusion. The Fed's real job, its original job, is to ensure economic stability. That in turn reliably results in a good environment for buying stocks.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What are your biggest winner and loser in the markets this week? Join the conversation below.
The market's faith in the Fed's abilities might be misplaced , though. Rate cuts can blunt the economic winds, but they can't stop them completely. Rate cuts, for instance, didn't prevent the last two recessions. They are not going to stop the next one, either, or make the coronavirus go away.
"The Fed's not going to be able to do anything against the virus," said Peter Boockvar, the chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. "It's not a vaccine."
More worrying, the Fed has less firepower now to combat a downturn than it did in the past. The Fed's only direct influence in the market is through its fed-funds rate. When the Fed wants to heat up or slow down the market, it adjusts its target rate (currently 1.50% to 1.75%). The current effective rate is about 1.58%.
Normally that works. But the 10-year Treasury note's yield—a record low of 1.296%—is below the fed-funds rate. The 30-year Treasury bond yield is 1.782%. How much cheaper can money get? How much more stimulus can the central bank realistically provide?
"The Fed will attempt to establish a 'put,'" Mr. Boockvar said, "but it may be worthless."
NEXT WEEK: Jobs
After this week's selloff, it is an all-bets-are-off market. But that doesn't mean the fundamentals don't matter anymore. Next Friday brings the most important data point of the month: the nonfarm payrolls report.
The January report was surprisingly strong, with nonfarm payrolls rising 225,000 . That was above the 2019 average of about 175,000 a month. For a jittery market, another strong number would be a welcome salve. A weak number will only exacerbate the market's fears.

Hong Kong Media Mogul Charged Over Protests as Authorities Target Pro-Democracy Figures; Police arrest Apple Daily newspaper founder Jimmy Lai, two opposition politicians for illegal assembly last summer

HONG KONG—Police swooped in at dawn to arrest a media tycoon and two other veteran pro-democracy figures who support the antigovernment protests, charging them with illegal assembly—six months after the fact.
Jimmy Lai, founder of the popular Apple Daily newspaper, known for criticizing and mocking China's leaders, was arrested Friday morning at his home, his newspaper said. Opposition politicians Lee Cheuk-yan and Yeung Sum were arrested separately, according to their parties.
Police said the arrests are related to an unauthorized march last Aug. 31 —a day burned in protesters' memories for how it ended: with police beating people inside subway trains, assaults filmed on phones and shared on social media. The 72-year-old Mr. Lai was also charged with criminal intimidation, relating to a 2017 case.
Authorities chose to hit the opposition movement when it is in a lull: The city is in a partial lockdown meant to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus , which causes a disease known as Covid-19. It has infected some 83,000 people world-wide and killed more than 2,800, mostly in neighboring China. Beijing recently replaced the heads of two of its key offices in semiautonomous Hong Kong, in what was seen as a sign of diminishing tolerance for dissent.
Mass street protests erupted in June, triggered by a proposed extradition law, and after the bill was pulled continued with further demands. They include greater democracy in choosing the city's chief executive and an independent inquiry into allegations of police brutality during the unrest.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam has shown no signs of yielding, and the police-watchdog agency has delayed its initial report on complaints against the force. The coronavirus outbreak has brought fresh criticism of Mrs. Lam , particularly complaints she was too slow to restrict visitors from mainland China . There are 94 cases of the coronavirus in Hong Kong.
Observers said simmering public anger could reignite street protests after virus fears subside, and criticized police for arresting people not responsible for organizing the Aug. 31 demonstration. An umbrella group called the Civil Human Rights Front had planned a major protest event that day, but canceled it after police denied permission.
Thousands gathered in the city's downtown anyway, and later in the day clashed with police. Late in the evening, police arrested people after forcibly removing them, some covered in blood, from a subway car stopped at a station.
The arrests were "blatant acts of political suppression" by the Hong Kong government and Beijing, said Samuel Chu, managing director of the Washington, D.C.-based Hong Kong Democracy Council.
"It is the Hong Kong government's naked attempt to silence opposition voices and it will not work," he said. "The rights to assembly and protest are enshrined in Hong Kong's constitution."
The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A police statement issued after the Aug. 31 demonstration severely condemned protesters, blaming them for escalating the violence.
A longtime and high-profile critic of the Chinese government, Mr. Lai founded Next Digital—originally Next Media—in the 1990s. It owns a number of publications in the region, including Apple Daily in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Some pro-democracy supporters see a subscription as a way to contribute to the protest movement. The Hong Kong edition has printed protest posters in the paper on some big demonstration days, such as July 1, the anniversary of the U.K.'s handover of the city to China.
Mr. Lai has been arrested before. In 2014, he was one of a number of pro-democracy lawmakers and activists detained following the Occupy Central movement, which paralyzed the city's downtown for almost three months. No charges were brought. Mr. Lai later stepped down as chairman of his media company, but remains the majority owner.
Mr. Lai met U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the White House last July to discuss the unpopular extradition bill and Hong Kong's autonomy under Beijing's "One Country, Two Systems" framework. He met Vice President Mike Pence on the same visit.
Mark Simon, a senior executive at Next Digital, said the arrests "didn't make sense," especially given the coronavirus.
"With all of the other problems that Hong Kong has, you really need high-profile arrests to stir the pot?" he said.
The police said they had filed the charges and released the three men on bail. A court hearing is scheduled for May.

Investors are shunning Italian government bonds after the country became Europe's epicenter for the coronavirus outbreak this week, leading to renewed worries about one of the region's most indebted economies.
Yields on the country's 10-year bonds rose, while those on German and French debt slid, signaling that fixed-income investors in Europe are pulling out of Italian sovereign debt and heading instead for the safety offered by less indebted economies. The week has also seen a sharp selloff in equities and other risky assets globally because of fears about how growth might suffer during a prolonged outbreak.
Investors tend to rush to the safety of government bonds when the world looks riskier. But in southern European countries such as Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal, investor skittishness has tended to infect sovereign-debt markets, too, in recent years. Since the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent eurozone crisis of 2011 and 2012, these countries' high debt levels and worse economic problems have made them more susceptible to selloffs.
Investors' move from riskier to safer government bonds has sharply increased the extra yield on Italian debt over German debt. On Thursday, that extra yield -- or spread -- on Italian 10-year bonds rose to 1.617 percentage points, which is up from the recent low of 1.287 percentage points two weeks ago, according to FactSet.
Part of this is German yields falling as investors rushed for safety as well as Italian yields rising: German 10-year yields slipped to minus 0.542% on Thursday from minus 0.445% at the end of last week. Italian yields jumped to 1.075% from 0.896% in the same period.
However, that is still far below the spread of more than 3 percentage points reached in late 2018, when Italy's government was building up to a showdown with the European Union's leadership over its generous spending and borrowing plans and fears rose that it could ultimately leave the eurozone.
Since then, the U.S. and European central banks have been forced back into interest-rate cuts and government-bond buying to support the economy and relive financial strains.
Some analysts think the selloff in Italian bonds could be a lot worse. The reason: Italian yields have been contained by investors' expectations that any serious economic disruption would lead to an increase in the European Central Bank's bond-buying program, which was restarted late last year in an effort to boost inflation. Yields on Spanish and Portuguese bonds have also risen, though much less than Italy's, while Greek bond yields have jumped the most.
"If they think if the eurozone is very weak -- and Italy is a big part of that -- the ECB is going to have to act, and one of the things they're going to do is buy the bonds," said Tom Kinmonth, senior fixed-income strategist at ABN Amro Bank NV.
Even though Italian bonds are being sold down, in general the market is still favoring central-bank assets as the fast-spreading epidemic leads to anxiety about economic growth, said Alberto Gallo, head of macro strategies at fund manager Algebris.
"We know that this is going to end up in fiscal and monetary stimulus, so we are not likely to bet against government debt from here," Mr. Gallo said.
Italian government debt could be among the biggest beneficiaries of ECB efforts to support the economy because it owns a smaller share of the country's bonds than most, which means it has room to buy more Italian debt before hitting limits.
Investors have grown jittery as the coronavirus outbreak has spread across Italy. By Thursday, 528 people in the country had contracted the virus, of whom 14 had died, making Italy the biggest epicenter outside Asia.

WASHINGTON
Bill Passes to Help
Replace Huawei Gear
The U.S. Senate approved legislation that would provide $1 billion for rural telecom carriers to replace equipment made by China's Huawei Technologies Co. in their networks. House lawmakers passed a similar bill in December.
The measure, if signed into law by President Trump, would provide funds for about 40 rural carriers that use Huawei gear, which the U.S. says could be used by Beijing to spy on the communications that flow through its networks. Huawei has disputed those assertions.
A Huawei representative criticized the legislation, saying it would "reduce the ability of broadband providers to provide the most secure network equipment and in turn hurt local consumers and businesses."

ECONOMY
Business Investment
Increased in January
A key measure of U.S. business investment rose in January, a sign businesses were more willing to spend in early 2020, despite coronavirus risks that erupted late that month.
New orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- or what are called core capital goods orders, a closely watched proxy for business investment -- increased 1.1% in January from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Thursday.
The rise came during a month when the U.S. and China signed an initial trade deal, marking a truce in a protracted trade spat between the two countries. The coronavirus outbreak also emerged that month in China and has spread to other parts of the world, and could pose a risk for the U.S. economy.

PHILADELPHIA
Safe-Injection Site's
Opening Hits Snag
Plans to open the nation's first sanctioned supervised drug-use site in Philadelphia next week have unraveled due to blowback from potential neighbors.
The nonprofit Safehouse's plan to open a site is on hold, Ronda Goldfein, the group's vice president, said late Thursday. Neighbors of the proposed site at a health facility in South Philadelphia raised concerns, and the landlord decided not to lease the property, she said.
Just a day earlier, a favorable court ruling led Safehouse to announce plans to open its first site next week. Advocates of such facilities, sometimes called safe-injection sites, argue they can save lives by putting medical help nearby to prevent fatal overdoses. The sites can also act as conduits to treatment.

WASHINGTON -- A whistleblower alleges that some federal employees were sent to work at coronavirus quarantine locations in California without adequate safety protocols and then flew back home on commercial airplanes, a person familiar with the complaint against the Department of Health and Human Services said.
The complaint, which HHS said it was evaluating, focuses on some employees who work at the Administration for Children and Families, an HHS division that handles programs such as Head Start and disaster emergency response and that performed functions at some of the quarantine camps.
The U.S. repatriated Americans from China on planes chartered by the State Department in early February. They were subject to 14-day quarantines.
Employees didn't receive prior safety training relevant to the California assignment, the whistleblower alleges, the person familiar with the complaint said. The employee who filed the complaint said she declined to go to one of the quarantine sites and was then reassigned for raising concerns about employee safety, the person familiar with the complaint said.
The employees weren't tested for the coronavirus before they left two California quarantine sites and flew home, the person familiar with the complaint said. There is no evidence that any of the workers contracted or spread the virus.
Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman at HHS, said on Thursday: "We take all whistleblower complaints very seriously and are providing the complainant all appropriate protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act."

Toy Industry Upended by China Disruption

Toy companies are delaying shipments and new product launches and struggling to fill retail orders as the coronavirus epidemic disrupts the industry's supply chain.
Some toy factories in China, where around 85% of the world's toys are made, remain closed and others are operating at a fraction of capacity, either because of worker shortages or difficulties securing raw materials and molds to make their products, industry executives and analysts said.
Inside factories that are operating, companies are installing dividers between workspaces and taking other precautions against the spread of the disease, which has raised the prospect of a global pandemic.
The disruption is threatening the carefully orchestrated schedule of manufacturing and shipments that delivers Barbie dolls and Nerf blasters to shelves. Some large retailers are searching for alternative products to fill holes in their inventories and considering delaying setting their shelves for the holiday season by a month.
It's the latest challenge for a toy industry that in recent years has faced the threat of tariffs and bankruptcies of key retailers including Toys "R" Us. Toy sales declined 4% in the U.S. last year, according to research firm NPD Group Inc.
"This is going to put some companies out of business if it goes on too long," said Steve Pasierb, president and chief executive of the Toy Association Inc., a trade group.
He said that many toy companies have convened war rooms with daily calls to their Chinese manufacturers for status updates. Some have said they might see their expected output fall by around 25% in the second quarter of the year.
Jay Foreman, chief executive of toy company Basic Fun Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., said that full production might not ramp up until April, and if the outbreak stretches much further, the holiday season could face trouble. "It will start to put strain on the supply chain for the second half of the year," he said.
At Toy Fair New York this week, the impact of coronavirus cast a long shadow at an event where hundreds of companies convened to showcase everything from Baby Shark to Baby Yoda toys. Large companies like Hasbro Inc., Mattel Inc. and Lego A/S are trying to minimize the effect of delayed factory openings. They have said they expect some impact to sales and supplies at the beginning of the year that could worsen if the outbreak drags on.
Anna Mowbray, co-founder of Zuru Ltd., which makes X-Shot blasters and Bunch O Balloons water balloons, said its factories have reopened in phases over the past few weeks. Zuru installed dividers between workspaces, added extra sanitation stations and implemented other precautionary measures. But the company is thinly staffed due to restrictions on China travel and is operating at just 20% of capacity right now, Ms. Mowbray said.
Zuru, which is based in Shenzhen, has had to scrap a new product launch for the year and is likely out tens of millions of dollars in revenue, Ms. Mowbray said. It is also asking retailers to be flexible with how much product they initially ship.
"There's definitely going to be holes on shelves," she said. "There's a hole for us in revenue because of it, and I think there's going to be less freshness."
Hog Wild Toys LLC has reopened its factory in Guangdong, but it is also running at only about 15% of capacity, said Joshua Loerzel, vice president of sales and marketing. But upstream in the supply chain, it is unable to get tooling equipment needed to make some new products as those producers are facing the same labor shortage.

Hollywood Box Office, Production Are Jolted

The coronavirus outbreak has already forced Hollywood studios to postpone the release of several prominent films in China. Now the epidemic is starting to disrupt production of the next slate of blockbusters.
Practically all movie theaters in the world's second-largest box office market have been closed since late January, an extraordinary measure Chinese health officials took as the number of new coronavirus cases, especially in major cities, grew rapidly.
As the virus spreads, production of at least one new film is also being affected -- actor Tom Cruise's next "Mission: Impossible" movie, which was slated to start filming in Italy.
For major studios like Walt Disney Co., Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures, there is no guarantee when they will be able to go back to business as usual in China, a market that is vital to their strategy of pouring resources into films with global appeal.
Two notable casualties so far have been Universal's "Dolittle," starring Robert Downey Jr., and Paramount's "Sonic the Hedgehog," which stars Jim Carrey. Both movies, marketed as family-friendly films, have had their Chinese releases postponed indefinitely, according to their respective studios.
Universal, owned by parent Comcast Corp., shelved its original plans to release "Dolittle" in China last month. The studio spent $175 million to make the movie and had hoped to offset some of the costs with a strong run in China. Mr. Downey is popular in the country thanks to his appearances in several Marvel movies. "Dolittle" fell flat in North America and has so far made a weak $204.9 million world-wide, according to Box Office Mojo.
"Sonic," released by ViacomCBS Inc.'s Paramount, has recorded two consecutive successful weekends in much of the world and grossed $204.2 million globally. But Paramount on Monday said it was delaying the film's China debut, originally slated for the end for February, without setting a new date.
Paramount, citing coronavirus, said it would release the movie in China when "it is appropriate to do so."
Oscar-winning films looking to capitalize on their awards glory with a theatrical run in China have also had their releases delayed. Universal's "1917" had its Chinese release bumped amid coronavirus worries and theater closures.
During the first quarter of the year, Chinese releases usually dominate the local box office, as families observing the Lunar New Year typically go on vacation and theaters emphasize local fare over imported titles.
Key releases slated for the second quarter include MGM Holdings Inc.'s latest James Bond film, "No Time to Die," and Disney's Avengers spinoff "Black Widow." The movies are scheduled for release in the U.S. and Canada in April and May, respectively.

Pressure on Crude Oil and Metals Persists

Commodities from oil to copper kept dropping Thursday, continuing a recent slide as traders expect the spreading coronavirus to cripple demand.
U.S. crude-oil futures slid 3.4% to $47.09 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, paring some of an earlier drop, but still recording the futures' lowest close since January 2019. Prices are 29% below a peak hit early this year. Brent crude, the global gauge of oil prices, closed down 2.3% to $52.18 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange.
Industrial metals also dropped. Front-month copper futures trimmed nearly all of their Thursday loss, ending the day down less than 0.1% at $2.5715 a pound in New York. Aluminum, zinc, tin and nickel fell on the London Metal Exchange and extended recent declines.
Thursday's synchronous slide came with stocks around the world tumbling and extended a punishing stretch for commodities sensitive to the transportation and manufacturing sectors.
China is a source of demand for the materials, so the early year slump in economic activity in the country as a result of the coronavirus has fueled projections for lukewarm consumption and excess supply.
More recently, the virus spreading to many other parts of the world has caused anxiety about a larger-than-expected drop in global travel. On Wednesday, a new case of coronavirus was confirmed in California that involved a person who didn't have a travel history or exposure to another person known to have the illness.
The rise of cases in countries from South Korea to Italy has also fanned fears that the ripple effects of the virus could result in gluts for a range of materials.
"The spread of the virus is spreading not only fear but oil-demand destruction and horror thinking about potential demand destruction to come," Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, said in a note to clients.
Oil-market traders are looking ahead to a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to see if the cartel deepens output cuts to stabilize the market.
The move is expected, but some analysts question whether even deeper supply curbs will boost crude with demand expected to fall substantially.
Hedge funds and other speculative investors have cut net bets on higher U.S. crude prices, pushing them to a nearly four-month low during the week ended Feb. 18, Commodity Futures Trading Commission figures show. At the same time, speculators have ramped up net wagers on lower copper prices.
Data for the week ended Tuesday will be released on Friday, with some analysts noting that a reversal in speculative wagers has likely made the slide in commodities even more severe.
Elsewhere in commodities Thursday, natural-gas futures tumbled 4.6% to $1.752 a million British thermal units, closing at a nearly four-year low, with traders expecting mild winter temperatures and steady production to result in a glut of the heating fuel. The coronavirus has also dented demand for natural gas.
Front-month gold futures erased an earlier advance, ending the day down less than 0.1% at $1,640 a troy ounce. Investors have generally favored the haven metal recently, pushing prices to a seven-year high on Monday, though those prices fell on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Shares of WPP Dive On Weak 2020 Sales

Shares of WPP PLC plunged to their lowest level in almost a decade after the world's largest advertising company said sales would be flat for 2020, adding more pressure on Chief Executive Mark Read.
WPP said organic revenue -- a closely watched measurement of its underlying operating performance -- declined 1.9% in the fourth quarter, compared with the 0.8% decline analysts forecast.
WPP shares dropped almost 17% on Thursday, down $9.78 to $47.92.
Like much of the advertising sector, WPP is grappling with challenges including increased competition from tech giants such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc., and consulting firms such as Accenture.
The British company, which owns agencies such as Wunderman Thompson and GroupM, is in the midst of a three-year turnaround plan after it was stung by losing business from clients such as American Express Co. and Ford Motor Co.
WPP said it is too early to predict the effects of the coronavirus epidemic, but many firms in the ad sector are bracing for fallout, since ad companies have operations across the globe.
"The market is worried about their revenue outlook of flat before the impact of the coronavirus and the lack of any margin improvement in 2020," said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Moffett Nathanson. "In addition, after showing improving revenue trends, the fourth quarter performance was a step back."
The downbeat outlook adds more pressure on Mr. Read, who took the reins of WPP in September 2018, after the departure of longtime CEO and founder Martin Sorrell.
Mr. Read has sought to slim down the company to make its operations, which span the globe, less unwieldy for marketers to navigate.
"We are pleased with the progress that we've made, but we're not in any way complacent," said Mr. Read during a conference call with analysts. "We know that we've got work to do." He added that the company has "made significant progress simplifying WPP," pointing out that it has gone from having nine networks of creative ad agencies to five.
For 2019 as a whole, the company said organic sales fell 1.6%. The company's 2020 guidance of flat sales excludes any hit from the coronavirus epidemic. Its projection fell short of analysts' expectations and is well below recent forecasts from rivals such as Omnicom Group Inc. and Interpublic Group of Cos. Earlier this month, Omnicom said it expects organic revenue growth of 2% to 3% for 2020.
In response to the coronavirus, WPP began restricting travel at the end of January, and its current policy is for no travel to China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea or Japan. Only essential business travel is allowed within the Asia-Pacific region or to Italy. Earlier this week, Omnicom closed the London office of one of its subsidiaries until Monday as a precautionary measure after a staff member developed flulike symptoms after returning from Australia via Singapore.
WPP's pretax profit fell to GBP 928.1 million ($1.20 billion) from GBP 1.26 billion with revenue of GBP 13.05 billion. Net profit fell to GBP 62.7 million.
"The second half of 2019 was stronger than the first, with performance improving globally and in the United States, our largest market," Mr. Read said. However, WPP's North American operations were hit by a 5.7% fall in net sales for last year, dragging the group's performance.
Under its turnaround program, launched in December 2018, WPP aims to return the company to sustainable growth in line with its peers in 2021 and operating profit margin of at least 15%.
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said 2020 was supposed to be the year when WPP started to deliver the benefits of its restructuring, but guidance for zero growth this year and the fourth quarter slump in sales seemed "uninspiring" for investors. "The targets for 2021 have been maintained but the market's patience appears to have snapped," Mr. Mould said in a note to clients.

Hospitals and public-health officials in the U.S. and Europe are rationing medical masks and scrounging for more, as they prepare for a potential widening of the coronavirus epidemic.
Global hoarding has left European wholesalers with empty shelves. Manufacturers outside China say they won't be able to fill an exploding stack of orders for months. U.S. hospitals and medical-supply companies have reported dwindling mask inventory and partial or delayed shipments as the surge in global demand for protective equipment enters a second month.
While many people in China have taken to wearing masks in public, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and its European counterparts are trying to reserve masks for health-care workers and patients. The CDC has urged the public not to use masks unless told to do so by a doctor.
Masks known as N95 respirators guard against the virus, but only if used properly. Other masks don't filter out small particles harboring the bug.
The U.S. has a stockpile of 12 million N95 masks, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told the Senate Appropriations Committee on Wednesday. The U.S. would need 300 million N95 masks to respond to an emergency, he said.
A Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman said today the agency has received reports of spot shortages and urged hospitals to report concerns to the agency.
In New York, officials have begun drawing from government stockpiles to fill requests from hospitals and nursing homes for thousands of respirator masks, more than one million surgical masks and 18,000 face shields in the past month, said Stephanie Buhle, a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
NYU Langone Health, which includes about 360 outpatient centers and four hospitals around New York, has removed all but an emergency supply of respirator masks from many locations to create a stockpile in case of a U.S. outbreak.
"We would love if there would be cavalry on the other side of the hill. We have to expect they are not going to come," said Michael Phillips, NYU Langone Health's chief epidemiologist.
The stockouts are a reckoning for the West, which for decades has outsourced the manufacture of goods including medical supplies to China.
Manufacturers say much of the world's protective-medical gear is made in Hubei, the quarantined province where the virus emerged late last year. Hubei is a global hub for producing masks, bandages, surgical drapes and gowns, said a spokesman for Medline Industries Inc., a Northfield, Ill., medical-supply manufacturer and distributor.
In Europe, where more than 500 cases emerged this week, chiefly in Italy, officials have told health-care workers to be prepared to reuse disposable face masks because the supply from China has been cut off.
"It is expected that there will be no deliveries to Europe as long as the crisis persists," the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's equivalent to the CDC, said last week.
As coronavirus spread through China weeks ago, the Vatican sent hundreds of thousands of masks to alleviate a shortage there. Now officials at Rome's Gemelli Hospital, where popes normally go for medical treatment, say they are worried about where to find masks after their current stock runs out in two months.
"There has been panic and a run on supplies," said Giovanni Paolo D'Incecco Bayard de Volo, Gemelli Hospital's head of procurement.
Masks are part of a wider shortage of basic goods that health-care workers need to combat a virus that has sickened 82,585 and killed 2,814. The European Medicines Agency said it is worried about a global medicine shortage, because many active pharmaceutical ingredients, the basic inputs for drugs, are produced in China. Italy's main pharmaceutical lobby this week said it was giving drugstores a recipe to produce their own hand sanitizer.
"Masks are just the beginning of the crisis," said Darius Sawicki, owner of Poland-based wholesaler Medyk eRKa. His suppliers have run out of several health-care products, including hand sanitizer. "There is nothing we can order, because their warehouses are empty," he said.
Officials in China have told companies making masks there to divert their output to the fight against the domestic outbreak, The Wall Street Journal reported this month. India, Taiwan and South Korea -- which is now grappling with its own outbreak of the virus -- have banned the export of masks made in those places.
Some mask makers that have ramped up production outside China say they remain reliant on raw materials produced there.
"In the next month or so, we're going to run out of components," said Ronald Reuben, chief executive of Medicom Group, in Montreal, which has raised production at factories in France and Augusta, Ga. "Europe will not be able to supply its own market."

World News: Swiss, U.S. Open Trade Channel To Iran

The U.S. and Switzerland formally launched a humanitarian trade channel for Iran on Thursday, a move meant to counter criticism of Washington's economic-pressure campaign while opening the way for the release of Americans detained by Tehran.
The humanitarian link allows international firms to trade in goods such as medical supplies, agricultural commodities and basic necessities without risk of U.S. sanctions-enforcement penalties. The Trump administration has come under fire, including from European allies and domestic political opponents, for inadvertently choking off such trade.
Some U.S. officials and diplomats involved in the matter say the trade move, if reciprocated by Tehran with the release of five Americans held in Iran, could cool building tensions and lead to a temporary halt in months of escalating provocations.
"We think our humanitarian gesture should be met with a humanitarian gesture of releasing innocent detainees in Iran," a senior administration official told The Wall Street Journal. "This should be a confidence-building measure, that would then lead to a consular dialogue so that we can get all of the remaining Americans out of jail."
Iran's mission to the United Nations didn't respond to requests for comment.
The opening of the trade channel also comes as Iran works to contain a rapidly spreading coronavirus epidemic. With the official death toll at 26, the government has closed schools and banned some public gatherings.
The senior administration official said the U.S. is working on providing assistance to help Iran address the problem, but expressed skepticism Tehran would accept it.
Iran worries "they will reveal to the world that the crisis is much worse than the regime has been broadcasting," the official said.
Iran accuses the U.S. of using the coronavirus outbreak to fan fears.
The U.S. has been working to get the humanitarian trade channel operational after the blacklisting of Iran's central bank in September for allegedly financing terrorist activity. That cut into trade flows already battered by earlier U.S. sanctions.
The Swiss-American channel aims to reassure firms that are skittish about incurring U.S. penalties by vetting their deals through the governments. Swiss-based firms can use the process without running afoul of Washington's stringent sanctions, worries that until now had inhibited unsanctioned humanitarian trade.
"This operationalizes the humanitarian channel because it removes the uncertainty," said Justin Muzinich, deputy U.S. Treasury secretary.

Virus Threatens Car-Parts Supply

The auto industry is preparing for supply-chain problems from the coronavirus outbreak in China to soon hit vehicle production in the world's healthiest car market: the U.S.
Automotive suppliers are warning car companies they could run out of certain parts used in North American factories in coming weeks, with particular concern over potential shortages of electronic components, industry executives and attorneys say. Hoping to stave off factory work stoppages, some manufacturers have taken the unusual and costly step of flying in critical parts by cargo planes.
Sheldon Klein, a Detroit-area attorney at Butzel Long representing auto-industry clients, said he has been sending letters daily on behalf of suppliers to auto makers in the U.S., warning of potential parts shortages and asking for leniency in their contracts because of the unforeseen nature of the outbreak.
One of his suppliers anticipates a problem that could result in halted production at one auto maker's assembly line within days, he said. Mr. Klein declined to give specifics because his discussions with clients are confidential.
"There is a strong likelihood that there will be disruption of production" at car companies in the U.S., Mr. Klein said. "It will get more serious before it gets better."
At least one major electronics supplier based in Japan has notified each of its North American customers -- more than a dozen auto makers -- that it expects to run out of certain parts in coming weeks and months, according to an executive at the company.
The coronavirus outbreak already has crippled China's auto market, the world's largest by sales, after several factories were idled for weeks from a government-ordered business shutdown in an effort to contain the outbreak. Some plants have reopened, though many are operating on thin staff. Others are scheduled to remain closed for days or weeks.
Vehicle sales in China cratered 92% in the first 16 days of February, according to the China Passenger Car Association. Several suppliers have cut profit forecasts in recent days because of the fallout, including electronics suppliers Aptiv PLC and Visteon Corp., and seat maker Adient PLC.
The global auto sector already was slowing even before the outbreak. China's once-booming market was sagging amid a trade war with the U.S. Forecasters predict a small decline in the U.S. car market in 2020 after years of near-record sales.
Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday cut its outlook for global auto sales, citing a coronavirus-related supply-chain disruption and a reduction in vehicle demand. The ratings firm expects a 2.5% drop, versus a prior forecast of a 0.9% decline.
Parts shortages already have forced some car factories to close or curb production in Japan and South Korea and has threatened some car output in Europe, where the virus has spread over the past week. But so far no auto maker has publicly disclosed an interruption at North American factories.
Any trouble in North America would be especially problematic for General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, which are struggling in overseas markets and increasingly reliant on the U.S. for the lion's share of their global profit. Each company says its North American operations are running normally.
This month, United Auto Workers officials flagged the risk of parts shortages at GM plants in Michigan, Indiana and Arlington, Texas, where the company's lucrative pickup trucks and big sport-utility vehicles are built. But production at those factories so far hasn't been affected, a company spokesman said.
Auto parts made in China generally take several weeks to be shipped via ocean freight to the U.S., a lead time that has so far delayed any impact on U.S. vehicle production, said Razat Gaurav, chief executive of LLamasoft, an Ann Arbor, Mich.-based supply-chain analytics firm.
However, with some critical components already in short supply, several car companies and auto-parts suppliers have chartered airplanes or booked space on commercial cargo planes to fly parts directly from China, Mr. Gaurav said.
Toyota Motor Corp., for instance, said some of its North American suppliers are shipping smaller components from China by plane. Nissan Motor Co. plans to reserve space on commercial cargo planes to ship key parts to other regions, a spokesman said.
Early trouble spots could include electronics like infotainment systems and audio equipment because they use semiconductor chips, which have more-limited supply networks, Mr. Gaurav said.
Renesas Electronics Corp. and Murata Manufacturing Co. Ltd., two Japan-based companies that specialize in electronic parts, said their Chinese factories had halted temporarily but have resumed production.
Semiconductor maker Rohm Co. Ltd., also of Japan, said output at one of its factories in China remains limited. It is trying to boost production at other Asian plants and is outsourcing some production, a spokesman said.
But pinch points also could emerge even for mechanical parts that have a broader supply base, such as brake pads and door hinges, Mr. Gaurav said, because so many auto makers are scrambling to find backup supplies.
Vehicles are made of roughly 30,000 individual parts. "That finished vehicle doesn't get off the shop floor until each of those component parts are in place," Mr. Gaurav said. "It's all or nothing."

Virus Sinks Stocks Into Correction

The February market rout deepened Thursday, as major stock indexes around the globe posted another round of significant declines and uncertainty over the impact of the coronavirus began shading into fear.
All three major U.S. indexes slipped into correction territory -- a drop of at least 10% from a recent peak -- and posted their biggest one-day point drops ever.
The Dow industrials tumbled 1,190.95 points, or 4.4%, to 25766.64, bringing its slide this week to more than 3,200 points. The S&P also declined 4.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 4.6%.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched their largest one-day percentage declines since August 2011 and the S&P, now down 12% from its Feb. 19, peak, entered a correction from an all-time high at a record speed, only six trading days.
Selling was broad based, with some energy and technology companies showing especially large declines. Shares that until last week were market highfliers posted double-digit percent losses, with Tesla Inc. sliding 13% and Virgin Galactic Holdings shedding 24%. Traders described an atmosphere of apprehension, with many fixating on headlines about the coronavirus epidemic, bracing for a drop in business activity and trying to get a grip on expectations for corporate earnings.
"Obviously it's a bloodbath," said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of Bahnsen Group, a wealth-management firm. "When you get into a free-fall mode, there's really little that can be done but wait for some sort of footing to be found."
Oil prices dropped more than 2%, with Brent crude settling at its lowest level since December 2018.
The technology sector, which until recently was leading the S&P 500's gains, lost 5.3% Thursday and is down 12% this week.
Even utilities and consumer staples shares -- which investors typically flock to during volatility because of their generous dividend payments -- were hit by the selling.
All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 are in negative territory for the year. Investors sought the relative safety of government bonds, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to record lows.
The S&P 500 fell 137.63 points to finish 12% below its record close on Feb. 19. Its six-session skid since the record marked the fastest-ever descent into a correction from an all-time high, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 414.29 points to 8566.48.
The list of fastest corrections comes with some limitations. It tracks the quickest 10% declines in the S&P 500 following an all-time high -- a caveat that excludes some of the epic episodes in markets, including the Oct. 19, 1987, crash that sent the Dow tumbling 22.6% in one day, the most ever.
The market had gone into correction the previous week, eliminating that day from consideration by this measure.
At the same time, the precipitous nature of the decline this month has grabbed the attention of traders and portfolio managers in a way that few previous selloffs have during the market's decadelong run to new highs.
Investors have grown increasingly pessimistic that efforts to stop the spread of the virus will prevent significant damage to the global economy. Some U.S. companies say they could lose as much as half their annual revenue from China if the coronavirus epidemic extends through the summer.
American businesses will generate no earnings growth in 2020 if the virus becomes widespread, Goldman Sachs Group's equity analysts warned.
"We have to brace ourselves for wave after wave of earnings downgrades," said Paul O'Connor, head of multiasset at Janus Henderson Investors. "The globalization of the virus extinguishes confidence in the V-shaped recovery that was the view last week."
Microsoft Corp. warned Wednesday that supply-chain disruptions from the coronavirus would hurt sales this quarter, making it the second major tech company -- after Apple Inc. -- to lower expectations because of the epidemic.
European indexes also dropped, with the Stoxx Europe 600 tumbling 3.7%. In early trading Friday in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 was down 3.5%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was off 2.3% and South Korea's Kospi was down 2.5%. But S&P futures traded higher.
Government bonds continued to rally. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury, which closed at a record low 1.310% on Wednesday, dropped to 1.296% Thursday, according to Tradeweb. Yields move in the opposite direction of bond prices.
A measure of turbulence in U.S. stocks also rose, with the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, jumping to a multiyear high of 39.16.
The options-based gauge tends to rise when markets fall and investors reach for insurancelike contracts to protect their portfolios.
"It's very scary on a personal level, and I think that psychology pervades through the market" said Sam Hendel, president and portfolio manager at Levin Easterly Partners. "As an investor, my job is to keep a cool head."
"Everyone is now trying to assess what the economic impact will be," said Neil Dwane, global strategist at Allianz Global Investors. "The U.S. is looking at Europe and Japan as evidence of how the world is responding."

Best Buy said sales rose over the holiday season, citing strong demand for phones and appliances during a period when many traditional retailers reported lackluster results.
The company said comparable sales increased 3.2% during the fourth quarter ended Feb. 1, marking 12 consecutive quarters of sales growth. In the U.S., online sales grew nearly 19% to $3.52 billion compared with the same quarter last year due to high average order values and more shoppers buying online, the company said.
Categories that helped boost sales included headphones, computing, appliances, mobile phones and tablets, the company said, offset by declines in the gaming category.
The retailer's shares fell more than 3% Thursday amid a broader market selloff.
Overall revenue rose 2.7% to $15.2 billion during the most recent quarter. In the U.S., which accounts for the bulk of Best Buy's sales, around a quarter or sales originated online, the company said.
Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas said Best Buy was closely monitoring developments related to the coronavirus outbreak and that it expects most of the impact to be felt in the first half of the year. "We view this as a relatively short-term disruption that does not impact our long-term strategy and initiatives," Mr. Bilunas said.
Best Buy's results are a positive note amid a holiday sales reporting season marked by lackluster results from many retailers, with some pointing to the shorter holiday buying period and weak toy and electronics sales. The period between Thanksgiving and Christmas was shorter by six days compared with the year before.
Target Corp. fell short of its own expectations, citing weak sales in toys and electronics. Macy's Inc. recently said it would close another 125 of its department stores. Walmart Inc. said fourth-quarter sales came in weaker than the company hoped, due to lackluster demand for toys, apparel and videogames in the last weeks before Christmas.
Best Buy said it expects to report comparable sales of flat to 2% for the current fiscal year and diluted earnings per share of $6.10 to $6.30, which includes the company's estimated impact from coronavirus.
Best Buy has undergone a turnaround in the past six years. The retailer shifted strategies, matching prices to competitors, adding services to reduce the company's reliance on new product releases and using stores to fulfill online orders.
Sales growth has slowed somewhat over the past year amid uncertainty about the impact of tariffs on Chinese goods. For the full fiscal year, comparable sales rose 2.1%.
Net earnings rose slightly to $1.54 billion for the full year, up from $1.46 billion the previous fiscal year.

Catch a spring training game? That won't be possible in two top Asian leagues, as authorities around the world respond to the spread of the coronavirus.
In Japan, exhibition games will no longer be open to fans, and teams will play in empty ballparks. In South Korea, exhibition games have been called off entirely.
Neither the Japanese nor the South Korean league has committed to start its regular season on time -- March 20 in Japan, March 28 in South Korea.
Major League Baseball is closely monitoring the coronavirus situation, consulting with the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services and providing recommendations from the CDC to players and teams.
It is unclear if the league has made contingency plans in the event the coronavirus develops into a public health emergency in the United States and forces the postponement of games. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the league halted play until Sept. 17 and made up the postponed games after the scheduled end of the regular season.
The Tokyo Olympics begin July 24, followed by the Paralympics on Aug. 25.
The coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people since it was discovered in December. More than 2,700 have died, most of them in mainland China. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has asked schools to close until late March.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday that 33 people have been diagnosed with the virus in the state, with more than 8,000 additional people under observation.

ETC.
Clijsters entered in Indian Wells
Kim Clijsters, a four-time Grand Slam singles champion who is making her second comeback to competitive tennis, was given a wild card entry into the BNP Paribas Open next month at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.
Clijsters, 36, is a two-time champion at Indian Wells. She retired in 2007 but returned to the women's tour in 2009 and won the U.S. Open that year. She won the U.S. Open again in 2010 and the Australian Open in 2011 before retiring again in 2012. She announced late last year she planned to return, but she was slowed by a knee injury.
Tournament organizers also announced that world No. 1 Novak Djokovic was given a doubles wild card entry and he will team up with fellow Serb Viktor Troicki. World No. 2 Rafael Nadal will team up with Marc Lopez in doubles, reuniting a pair that won the Indian Wells doubles title in 2010 and 2012 and the gold medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

Will outbreak hit global drug supply?

As consumers worldwide adapt to life under the coronavirus, George Timek had what he thought was a perfectly reasonable question: Where is his medicine made?
We're not talking about anything fancy. Timek, 76, was shopping for acetaminophen at BJ's Wholesale Club and was curious about the country of origin.
He looked and looked. Nowhere did it say where the product was manufactured.
"Is this legal not showing country of origin on the bottle?" he asked me.
The answer is yes, although country of origin does have to be disclosed somewhere, possibly on the outer box, possibly online.
Be that as it may, tracking down what many people -- especially now -- might view as a crucial piece of information is much harder than it should be.
Timek's concern also highlights a challenge on the horizon for millions of Americans: maintaining healthcare regimens amid disruptions to the global supply chain.
Your medicine, prescription or otherwise, may not come from China (although many do), but there's a high likelihood it contains ingredients that originated in China and other countries affected by the coronavirus.
"One of the ugly secrets of the pharmaceutical industry is that the vast majority of raw materials that go into a prescription drug are produced overseas, mostly in China and India," said Geoffrey Joyce, chairman of the Department of Pharmaceutical and Health Economics at the USC School of Pharmacy.
"The coronavirus shutting down China or India for an extended period of time is likely to have a substantial impact on the supply of many drugs," he warned.
William Comanor, a professor of health policy and management at UCLA, was even more emphatic.
"Tell your readers to stock up on generics!" he said. "You're going to see shortages."
That may be just a tad alarmist. But I'll admit I've ordered additional supplies of my own meds.
BJ's is an East Coast big-box discounter that competes with Costco. Like many retailers, the company has its own in-house brands that serve as cheaper alternatives to the big national brands.
Its Berkley Jensen acetaminophen is a generic rival to Tylenol.
Nowhere does it say on the BJ's website where the product comes from. A BJ's service rep told me it's manufactured in the United States.
What about the ingredients?
"I don't know," the rep answered after tapping away at her computer keys. "It doesn't say."
She said BJ's acetaminophen, like many of the company's over-the-counter drugs, is produced by a company called Perrigo, which is based in Michigan but, for tax purposes, claims Dublin, Ireland, as its official headquarters.
Perrigo says its products "are available at retailers, pharmacies and e-commerce outlets in the United States, across Europe and in other major markets."
Before we go any further, it's important to note that U.S. Customs law has a big loophole when it comes to country-of-origin labeling.
It doesn't require that the sources of a drug's ingredients be disclosed. Rather, the law says a drugmaker can claim as the country of origin wherever the drug's various components were "substantially transformed" into the final product.
That means a drug manufacturer can gather ingredients from around the world. But if it pulls them all together into pill form in the United States, the country of origin can be claimed as the U.S.
This, of course, does consumers no favors.
UCLA's Comanor observed that the vast majority of U.S. drug sales involve generics, so coronavirus-related disruptions may have a lesser effect on name-brand pharmaceutical companies, which favor domestic production of ingredients.
But for such things as generic over-the-counter drugs and generic prescription meds, he said, consumers are at the mercy of global supply chains.
"I want to be able to buy generics made from active ingredients produced in the U.S.," Comanor said. "I cannot do that."
The generic acetaminophen that Timek purchased is a good case in point.
The country of origin -- that is, where the final tinkering was performed -- may be the United States, but the ingredients are more like an episode of "Dora the Explorer."
Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is America's most widely used drug ingredient, found not just in namesake pills but also as a component of hundreds of cold, flu and allergy remedies.
A recent study determined that 84% of the world's supply of acetaminophen comes from China and India, with China accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total.
The United States is the world's single largest market for generic acetaminophen, the study found.
Then there are all the inactive ingredients in BJ's acetaminophen. These include various components that go into making a pill a pill, such as croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone and assorted colorings, all of which almost certainly come from overseas factories, primarily in China.
I reached out to both Perrigo and BJ's for comment. Neither company responded.
Pharmaceutical experts emphasized that most drug factories worldwide operate under strict safety standards.
Just because an ingredient comes from China or India doesn't mean it's unsafe. But it does mean that if factories in those countries face production difficulties, shortages of finished drugs can be felt around the planet.
At this point, it's unclear how widespread the disruptions are. Chinese authorities have released no information on drug factory closures. Large U.S. drug companies say they have sufficient inventory to handle demand, at least in the near term.
The Food and Drug Administration says no coronavirus-related drug shortages have yet been reported to the agency. But it has contacted dozens of Chinese manufacturers with a reminder that they have to report any disruptions. The FDA calls the situation "evolving and very dynamic."
Experts say it would be unlikely for overseas companies to stockpile most raw ingredients solely for domestic use. But some fear China could curtail exports of materials used in the production of antibiotics if demand for such drugs surges at Chinese hospitals.
About 90% of the core components of leading antibiotics such as amoxicillin and penicillin come from China.
"You could say that when China sneezes, the average American consumer feels it, and this is because of the nature of the global supply chain," said Adegoke Oke, an assistant professor of global management at Arizona State University.
"Consumers must get used to the fact that their meds, and in fact many other products, come from all over or depend on ingredients from all over," he said.
Rachna Shah, an associate professor of supply chain and operations at the University of Minnesota, said the FDA does a reasonably good job of monitoring the safety of drug ingredients produced worldwide.
"However, there is no central mechanism to ensure drug availability," she said. "Disruptions such as the coronavirus expose this dependence on foreign sources and heighten the fears associated with drug shortages."
She and others said the drug industry is scrambling to keep shelves stocked.
"Companies have business continuity plans and I am sure are working hard to respond," said Ravi Anupindi, a professor of operations research and management at the University of Michigan.
He added, however: "They need to reduce their dependence on China."
I agree. I'd also say it's time that the FDA cast more sunlight on its drug disclosure regulations.
This seems like a perfect opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to find common ground and pass legislation requiring country-of-origin labeling for medicines to include global sourcing of active ingredients.
The production of acetaminophen and other generics may be finalized in this country, but if the components all come from China or India, that's a data point consumers are entitled to know.
And if it's too much hassle to put that on the label, at the very least such transparency should be introduced online for anyone interested in knowing more about what they're putting in their mouth.
As it stands, our disclosure rules appear designed more to hide countries of origin rather than reveal them.
At times like these, that's not very helpful.

The four-day delay in testing a California woman for coronavirus highlights how a faulty test and, until Thursday, a narrow definition of who should be tested have hindered the United States' ability to track how widely the disease has spread. Infectious-disease experts worry the disease may be spreading undetected in other places.
Those concerns were stoked by the emergence of the nation's first case of community transmission in Northern California, where hospital administrators say the patient, a woman, was not tested when clinicians requested it because she did not meet strict Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria that recommended testing only those with symptoms who recently returned from China, or who had close contact with a person confirmed to be infected with covid-19.
'We have just a few hundred testing kits in the state of California,' Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said Thursday at a news conference. 'That's simply inadequate to do justice to the kind of testing that is required to address this issue head on. . . . Testing protocols have been a point of frustration for many of us.'
'You don't know what you don't know unless you're testing,' he added.
The problems underscored by the California case include the limited availability of tests " which were shipped out to labs nationwide with a problematic component that is only now being corrected " and the federal testing criteria, which had become outdated as the outbreak evolved from being centered in China to spreading in more than three dozen countries. On Thursday, the CDC expanded federal guidelines to include testing for people who have unexplained severe respiratory symptoms and people with symptoms who have recently traveled to Iran, Italy, Japan or South Korea.
Newsom said the state was working with the CDC to get more testing kits and the ability to do tests without shipping samples across the country.
'There's a desperate need to do more testing,' said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. 'The point is to find out if, like many other countries, we have undetected chains of transmission that we're just not detecting.'
While Lipsitch said that Guangdong province in China had conducted more than 300,000 tests in fever clinics, the United States has tested 445 people, not including those who were evacuated. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Thursday that 3,600 tests have been run but did not clarify how many people had received them.
In addition, the tests sent out nationwide earlier this month had a faulty component that has required most samples to be sent to the CDC in Atlanta for analysis. There were signs Thursday that federal health officials were correcting those problems. As of 9-a.m. Thursday, Scott Becker, executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said he was aware of only eight public health labs currently able to run tests but that about 40 more labs are expected to come online very shortly. And he said he expected all 100 public health labs across the country to be able to run tests by the end of two weeks.
Infectious-disease experts and others had been calling for the expanding of testing criteria for some time.
'It's long overdue that [testing criteria] be broadened,' said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. He said the reason testing should include people with unexplained symptoms is because 'travel history will become less important as we have community spread in countries around the world, as well as perhaps in the United States.'
He also said that it is important to test people with mild symptoms; right now, the emphasis is on those with lower respiratory symptoms, including coughing or shortness of breath, versus symptoms such as runny noses and sore throats. 'But testing people with milder symptoms will give us an understanding of how widespread this is,' Adalja said.
Hawaii Lt. Gov. Josh Green, who is an emergency physician, gave the example of a person who arrived in his state with flulike symptoms earlier this week from Las Vegas.
'Very likely, he had the flu; he hadn't been in a region of concern for a full month, but it would have been very convenient to test,' Green said. 
Some people who have fallen ill with what they fear may be the coronavirus are also upset they haven't been able to get tested because they haven't met the CDC criteria.
A 57-year-old woman who lives in New York City said that her husband developed a severe sore throat after returning from a business trip to South Korea in mid-February. He got a strep test, which came back negative. Ten days later, she got sick, with many more symptoms, including aches and pains, headache, congestion, and fever. Her doctor wanted her tested for the coronavirus, but she wasn't eligible because she hadn't traveled to a country with widespread transmission or been in contact with someone known to be infected.
'The testing needs to be broadened,' said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing privacy concerns. 'If you don't test, you don't find. This is irresponsible.'
The woman said she has decided to self-quarantine for several days but worries that other people might not suspect they are infected and will pass on the virus.
Jeff Engel, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, said that the tests not working has been the biggest impediment, in part because public health officials need to gain experience using them as they ramp up.
'I think the biggest disappointment was not getting field experience on laboratory testing,' Engel said. 'We've already lost two weeks on that, and I think that was the biggest blow to progress.'
Officials are taking steps to try to fix the test. One of the three reagents, or components of the test, was giving inconclusive results when many laboratories were trying to verify that it was working. Public health labs received guidance late Wednesday afternoon that would allow them to go ahead with tests using two of the three components, if they were able to get those working. New test kits are expected to be sent out to labs next week.

Agency orders 25 percent more cleaning supplies, gloves and face masks
Metro has activated a pandemic task force, which has ordered stepped-up cleaning and disinfecting of stations, buses and rail cars in response to the anticipated spread of the coronavirus in the United States.
The transit agency has ordered 25-percent more hospital-grade cleaning solution, disposable gloves and face masks as it enters its 'phase 1' emergency preparedness for the possible spread of the illness here.
Metro Chief Safety Officer Theresa M. Impastato said the task force is meeting weekly to increase monitoring for the illness. Members include representatives of several Metro departments including emergency management, police, and occupational health and wellness.
On buses, which are typically wiped down weekly, areas such as fare boxes, steering wheels and the semi-closed bus operator compartments are being wiped down daily, Metro said. Rail cars are going through what the agency called a hospital-level disinfectant process weekly.
California officials announced Thursday that the state is monitoring 8,400 people who may have been exposed to coronavirus after traveling to Asia. Thousands more people across the United States have been asked for self-isolation or for checks for coronavirus symptoms this month. A Northern California woman has contracted the coronavirus without traveling to regions hit by the outbreak or coming into contact with anyone known to have the infection " a first, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.
No cases have been reported in the Washington region, and Metro has been told by health officials that the risk of infection is low. 
'That being said, good hygiene practices are the most effective method of prevention of any respiratory illness including covid-19,' Impastato said. (The novel coronavirus causes the disease named covid-19.)
Metro is coordinating with regional agencies and taking its cue from the CDC and World Health Organization before taking preventive measures, the agency said.
'We have consulted with CDC on cleaning frequency and they 'took no exceptions' with our current game plan,' Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said. 'We will continue to follow expert guidance as this process moves along and more is learned about covid-19.'
Metro officials are also emphasizing to passengers that they should follow rules for good transit hygiene, which mirrors what health officials have been stressing: wash your hands frequently, keep your hands out of your face, cough into your elbow, use hand sanitizer and stay home if you're sick.
'We can disinfect surfaces in Metro, and we can step that up 10 times and it still won't be as effective as just good personal hygiene on the part of the million people who ride our buses and trains,' Stessel said. 'Because if we happen to clean that [rail car] pole at 9 a.m., and then at 9:05 someone contaminates it, lets say, and at 9:06, that's you on the pole " then it doesn't do any good.'
Budget feedback 
In other news, Metro board members responded Thursday to comments heard from public hearings this week on the proposed budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1. The overwhelming sentiment from citizens was that no Metrobus routes be cut.
The proposed spending plan would extend late-night Metro service to six days a week for the first time in four years, while also offering a new weekend flat fare of $2. It would eliminate the bus-rail transfer fee, increase frequency of weekend bus and rail service and incentivize SmarTrip card use. But to cover the cost of those changes, the budget would raise rail fares, impose a surcharge for using cash on buses and eliminate or reduce service on dozens of Metrobus routes.
About 8,500 people have turned in surveys on the proposed budget compared with 5,800 last year, Metro said; more than 200 have spoken at the public hearings, including a packed house on Wednesday.
Metro board Chairman Paul C. Smedberg said it has surprised him that he has heard no complaints about the fare hike " the first in three years. Riders have been very vocal, however, in opposition to the bus route cuts. On Thursday, the majority of the board meeting's public comment portion was focused on the route changes.
'You should not cut any bus system, you should not cut any buses, you need to make it stronger,' said Denise Rush, a member of Metro's Accessibility Advisory Committee. 'In Washington, D.C., you're putting up million-dollar condos, and people can't ride the bus to get where they need to be, and they're being cut off because they live far out. There's something wrong with that picture.'
The plan is also opposed by the Montgomery County Council, which sent Metro a letter strongly objecting to cuts in its jurisdiction. The council has scheduled its own public hearing on the budget for Monday and plans to send the feedback to the transit agency just before serious budget deliberations begin, Metro board member Michael Goldman said. 
'The budget is very controversial, and since the only site for a [Metro budget public] hearing was in Prince George's County this year, the county council has decided on their own initiative to hold a town hall meeting,' said Goldman, who represents Maryland.
Smedberg said board members are paying close attention.
'A lot of focus has primarily been on the bus issue and some of the bus routes that are up for potential cuts,' he said. 'But you know that's the purpose of this " to get that input and take it all in " and we'll evaluate those comments with staff to see if there's any changes we need to make.'
The board also attempted to respond to complaints it has fielded for a planned summer shutdown of the Vienna and Dunn Loring Metro stations. The two Orange Line stations are closing temporarily beginning in mid-May while the stations and platforms undergo repairs and improvements. 
Metro plans to provide buses from the stations to other Metro stations. The board Thursday also agreed to waive parking fees during the station closures to alleviate some of the inconvenience and to encourage people to use the 'bus bridges.' 
Metro anticipates that it will lose about $2.5-million by offering free parking at the stations, which have a combined 7,000 parking spaces.

Woman had no known exposure
CDC to widen coronavirus test criteria amid criticism
VACAVILLE, Calif. " California has launched a far-reaching effort to find anyone who might have come in contact with a new coronavirus patient infected despite having no known link to others with the illness, as federal officials tried Thursday to fix the faulty testing process that has hamstrung their ability to track how widely the disease is spreading.
U.S. officials raced to meet the daunting new challenge of a virus that could be spreading through a Northern California community, even as the covid-19 virus continued its relentless march around the globe. Stock markets continued to plunge, Japan initiated a weeks-long school closure and an Iranian lawmaker contracted the infection. From the Middle East to South Korea to parts of Europe, the number of deaths and infections continued to grow.
In Washington, Vice President Pence convened his first meeting as the new head of the task force battling the virus. On the other side of the country, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and state health officials sought to reassure jittery residents that public health officials would be able to handle the first U.S. case of community transmission.
Projecting an air of calm during a moment of rising anxiety over the outbreak, Newsom repeatedly told reporters that methods of tracing a Solano County woman's contacts have been honed in response to other public health crises, from tuberculosis to the swine flu.
'This is not our first great challenge as it relates to public health,' Newsom said. 'Quite the contrary. These protocols have been perfected.'
Federal officials have faced fierce criticism for overly narrow criteria about who should be tested and for shipping coronavirus test kits to public health labs that included a component that in most cases did not work correctly. 
But on Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded the federal guidelines for testing to include people who have unexplained severe respiratory symptoms and people with symptoms who have recently traveled to Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea as well as China.
Federal health officials also are moving to try to correct the problems with the test kits. Scott Becker, executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said that although only eight public health labs are able to run the tests, federal officials have approved a procedural change that may allow about 40-more labs to come online very shortly. 
New tests are expected to be sent out to labs next week. That should result in all 100-public health labs across the country being able to run tests by the end of two weeks.
Newsom and state health officials acknowledged the Solano County woman was in the community and showing symptoms of the disease before she was admitted to a hospital here Feb.-15. That is a worrisome prospect because the virus is highly transmissible, especially when someone with the disease has its flulike symptoms. 
Bela Matyas, Solano County's health officer, said members of the woman's family who came into contact with her have been identified and are being kept in isolation while awaiting their test results. They will be kept there for 14-days since their last contact with her, Matyas said. 
Officials did not share other details of the woman's family, work or social contacts, citing patient privacy, and declined to say how many people she came in contact with, except at work.
Steve Huddleston, vice president of public affairs for NorthBay Healthcare, which runs the hospital where the woman was first admitted, said the system is still identifying people who have come in contact with the patient. He said it is 'dozens . . . but it still remains less than a hundred.'
Experts reminded the public that, in other parts of the world at least, most cases of the virus are mild. To date, the coronavirus has killed more than 2,800 people and sickened more than 82,000, the vast majority of them in China. The United States has seen 60-cases, none fatal, and most of them among people who caught the virus while quarantined on a cruise ship off Japan.
Nevertheless, the CDC warned Americans on Tuesday that community spread is almost certain and that they should prepare for the possibility of significant disruption in their daily lives.
'This virus has adapted extremely well to the human species,' said Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key member of the coronavirus task force. 'This one has the capability of spreading readily from human to human.'
Solano County, where the new case emerged, is home to Travis Air Force Base, where hundreds of Americans repatriated from China and from the Diamond Princess cruise ship have been quarantined. Officials have said the woman had no known contacts with people quarantined on the base.
Newsom said the CDC was sending 10-staffers to aid state and local personnel in tracing the woman's contacts. 
Mark Ghaly, secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency, described a 'robust and first-class reaching out to . . . many, many individuals in all walks of this person's life.' That includes the people who cared for her at NorthBay VacaValley Hospital here, according to Aimee Brewer, president of NorthBay Healthcare.
The Solano County woman wasn't tested for the disease for four days, despite an immediate request to the CDC, because she did not meet the strict criteria for the test, according UC-Davis Medical Center, where she is being treated after spending four days at the community hospital in Vacaville. 
The CDC disagreed in a statement Thursday, saying it asked for samples to test the patient for covid-19 on Sunday, the same day the agency was informed about her case. The statement also said clinicians always have discretion to order the test for people who do not meet the criteria.
The patient brought herself to NorthBay VacaValley Hospital, a 50-bed community hospital in Vacaville, Calif., with flulike symptoms on Feb.-15.
Staff members at that hospital questioned the woman about travel and contacts under CDC guidelines, but she did not meet the criteria for someone who should be tested for the virus, because she had not recently traveled to China or had contact with someone who is a confirmed case, according to Brewer.
The hospital is 'meticulously tracing' anyone who may have come into contact with the woman there, and monitoring scores of staff members who may have been exposed,' Brewer said in a statement. She added that staffers who had direct contact with the patient have been tested for the virus and are on paid leave, tracking their health at home. So far, there have been no positive tests, she said. 
Brewer said in an interview that the woman had a private room, and 'we believe strongly that our patients are protected.'
The hospital was going through 'records and security footage to make sure we know every person who has been in contact with the patient to determine if they are a low, medium or high risk,' she said. 'We did that last night and are finishing it up today.'
Staff at NorthBay inserted a tube in the woman's lungs to help her breathe, a procedure experts say increases risk of exposure to the virus because it can aerosolize respiratory droplets, according to a person briefed on the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the patient's care.
When the woman's health continued to decline, Brewer said, she was transferred to UC-Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, which has more capacity and expertise with pulmonary patients. UC-Davis officials said she arrived there on Feb.-19.
'Contact tracing,' or finding people the woman has come in contact with, 'sounds simple,' but 'is really a resource-intensive effort, even with a single case' said Thomas Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 
'They are going to be working to identify everyone who spent substantial time in close contact " within six feet " during the time the person could have been incubating the virus. Family is fairly straightforward, then close co-workers, but there may have been contacts' that are more difficult for public health workers to track down.
'Standing in line quite briefly next to a person would probably be considered low risk, but sitting next to someone in church for a half-hour might be high risk,' he said.
A pair of colleges in nearby Sacramento said they have sent home two students " one from each school " who came into contact with the infected woman. The students at American River College and Cosumnes River College were exposed during their work as health-care providers. 
Like other health-care workers who have had contact with the patient, the students have been asked by county health officials to isolate themselves for 14-days and monitor for symptoms. 
Neither school is asking other students to stay home, and classes are continuing as scheduled.
On Thursday afternoon, UC-Davis announced that three students who lived in its Kearney Hall dormitory were in insolation and being monitored for symptoms of coronavirus. One of the three was getting a covid-19 test from the CDC, while the other two had shown no symptoms and would not be tested, per current CDC guidelines. The dorm is located on the main UC-Davis campus in Davis, Calif., about 19-miles west of the UC-Davis Medical Center.
The university did not say how or where the students were exposed to the virus or where they were staying while in isolation, because they were no longer in their campus housing. The university said it plans to increase daily sanitation procedures in Kearney Hall. No UC-Davis classes are being canceled at this time.
UC-Davis Medical Center officials sent an email to employees Wednesday that said the woman arrived at the medical center Feb.-19 but was not tested until Sunday because she did not meet the criteria. 
'When the patient arrived, the patient had already been intubated, was on a ventilator, and given droplet protection orders because of an undiagnosed and suspected viral condition,' according to an email sent by David Lubarsky, vice chancellor of human health sciences, and Brad Simmons, interim chief executive of UC-Davis Health. 'Since the patient arrived with a suspected viral infection, our care teams have been taking the proper infection prevention (contact droplet) precautions during the patient's stay.' 
UC-Davis asked the CDC to conduct a test for the virus because local and state labs were not doing so. 'Since the patient did not fit the existing CDC criteria for covid-19, a test was not immediately administered. UC Davis Health does not control the testing process,' they wrote.
The CDC ordered a test Sunday and additional precautions were taken, they wrote. The agency confirmed the positive test Wednesday.

Virus hurts the movies' bottom line

Along with other entertainment sectors such as fashion, sports and travel, the increasingly global film market is already seeing effects from the coronavirus as it continues spreading throughout various countries. The latest fallout came earlier this week when a three-week shoot set in Venice for the seventh Mission: Impossible film was put on hold after the number of confirmed cases in Italy reached into triple digits.
'Out of an abundance of caution for the safety and well-being of our cast and crew, and efforts of the local Venetian government to halt public gatherings in response to the threat of coronavirus, we are altering the production plan,' a representative from Paramount Pictures said in a statement. 'We will continue to monitor this situation, and work alongside health and government officials as it evolves.' 
The coronavirus has already shut down much of China and its film industry, and officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and other U.S. agencies said this week it is 'inevitable' that the virus would spread here.
China is the largest movie market outside the United States, and the domestic film industry could be severely affected if the virus spreads domestically.
Some film executives are already reacting. In addition to halting production on 'Mission: Impossible VII,' Paramount has indefinitely suspended the Chinese release of 'Sonic the Hedgehog,' which has been dominating the domestic box office. The releases of 'Dolittle,' '1917,' 'Jojo Rabbit' and 'Little Women' there have also been suspended. A promotional tour and premiere scheduled to take place in April for the latest James Bond film, 'No Time to Die,' has already been canceled.
On a recent earnings call, Imax chief executive Richard Gelfond said the company 'faced head winds in China early this year due to the coronavirus,' which made for a 'tough start' to 2020. 'While the coronavirus is a serious short-term challenge, we see it as a rare, out-of-the-ordinary event that will ultimately pass,' he added.
An analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid called the situation a 'big mess' and told The Washington Post that there is consternation in the film industry, partially because of how unprecedented the situation is. 'We haven't seen anything like this before, and we don't know long it will last,' he said. 'China now is a much bigger part of the overall box office than when SARS occurred.' 
Before the outbreak, China was expected to surpass the United States as the largest movie market in the world this year, according to B. Riley FBR analyst Eric Wold.
Compounding the problem is that China began shuttering movie theaters just before the Lunar New Year, a time when they historically see the most foot traffic. As noted in the Hollywood Reporter, 'Ticket revenue in China in the three weeks following the shutdown totaled just $3.9 million, compared with $1.52 billion during the same stretch last year.' 
Studios are presented with a few difficult choices. They can release a film into a country that isn't going to movie theaters (and, for the most part, isn't able to). They can delay a film in hopes that they'll be able to later release it in China, making it subject to the country's restrictive policies on imported films. (As Peter Schloss, CEO at CastleHill Partners, a Beijing-based bank focused on the entertainment industry, told the Hollywood Reporter, 'Imported films are likely to suffer in the rescheduling as we have to expect Chinese films to get priority.' Plus, as Wold noted, even if every film is eventually released in China, moviegoers may not immediately feel comfortable rushing back to reopened theaters.) Or they can send a film straight to video or streaming services, meaning they would probably never recoup production costs " much less turn a profit. (This is unlikely, Wold said, as it 'would set a bad precedent.')
Analysts seem confident that the current situation is a weatherable storm for these studios. What could prove devastating for domestic studios is a widespread outbreak in the United States, one that keeps people sequestered in their homes.
'The real risk with the domestic market is, if we see theater closures like we've seen in international markets, do we get to the point where theaters are actually closing or where consumers don't feel comfortable going into places where people are congregating?' Wold asked, pointing out that 'where stock prices are hit the most in the past couple of days, it's theater stocks, theme park stocks and places where people congregate.' 
Still, he emphasized, 'At this point, it's perceived risk more so than actual risk.'

Whistleblower alleges retaliation after concerns about evacuee contact
Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services sent more than a dozen workers to receive the first Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, without proper training for infection control or appropriate protective gear, according to a whistleblower complaint.
The workers did not show symptoms of infection and were not tested for the virus, according to lawyers for the whistleblower, a senior HHS official based in Washington who oversees workers at the Administration for Children and Families.
The whistleblower is seeking federal protection because she alleges she was unfairly and improperly reassigned after raising concerns about the safety of these workers to HHS officials, including those within the office of HHS Secretary Alex Azar. She was told Feb. 19 that if she does not accept the new position in 15 days, she would be terminated.
The whistleblower has decades of experience in the field, received two HHS department awards from Azar last year and has received the highest performance evaluations, her lawyers said.
The complaint was filed Wednesday with the Office of the Special Counsel, a federal watchdog agency. The whistleblower's lawyers provided a copy of a redacted 24-page complaint to The Washington Post. A spokesman for the Office of the Special Counsel confirmed that it has received the complaint and has assigned the case.
The complaint alleges HHS staff were 'improperly deployed' and were 'not properly trained or equipped to operate in a public health emergency situation.' The complaint also alleges the workers were potentially exposed to the coronavirus because appropriate steps were not taken to protect them and staff were not trained in wearing personal protective equipment, even though they had face-to-face contact with returning passengers. The workers were in contact with passengers in an airplane hangar where evacuees were received and on two other occasions: when they helped distribute keys for room assignments and hand out colored ribbons for identification purposes.
'We take all whistleblower complaints very seriously and are providing the complainant all appropriate protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act. We are evaluating the complaint and have nothing further to add at this time,' HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said.
The whistleblower, in her complaint, states that 'appropriate steps were not taken to quarantine, monitor, or test [the workers] during their deployment and upon their return home.' 
The repatriated Americans were among those evacuated from Wuhan and quarantined on military bases in California and Texas because they were considered at high risk for contracting the flulike illness.
About 14 personnel from the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) were sent to March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, Calif., and another team of about 13 ACF personnel was sent to Travis Air Force in Fairfield, Calif., according to the complaint and one of the whistleblower's lawyers, Ari Wilkenfeld. Several people within HHS voiced objections to sending the ACF personnel to receive passengers, according to a person familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
A second person familiar with the situation said the workers were not tested for the coronavirus because none of them met the criteria, which was restricted at that time to people with symptoms and either a recent trip to China or close contact with a person confirmed to be infected with covid-19. If the workers had exhibited symptoms, appropriate protocol would have been followed.
The deployments took place Jan. 28 to Jan. 31, around the time when the first planeload of evacuees arrived at March, and Feb. 2 to Feb. 7, when additional flights were arriving at Travis. The planes each carried about 200 Americans.
After their deployments, the workers returned to their normal duties, some taking commercial airline flights to return to their offices across the country, the lawyers said.
'Our client was concerned that ACF staff " who were potentially exposed to the coronavirus " were allowed to leave quarantined areas and return to their communities, where they may have spread the coronavirus to others,' said Lauren Naylor, one of the whistleblower's lawyers.
The whistleblower is also seeking assistance from the office of Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), a member of the House Ways and Means Committee and vice chair of the House Oversight Committee, according to a Gomez spokesman.
During a hearing Thursday, Gomez asked Azar whether any employees from ACF could have been sent to help with the repatriation of Americans from Wuhan without any training in emergency response. Azar replied that some ACF employees were involved.
Asked what sort of health and safety training the personnel received and whether any of them were exposed to high-risk evacuees from China, Azar said: 'They never should have been without P.P.E,' referring to personal protective equipment.
Asked whether any protocols may have been broken, Azar replied, 'I don't believe that has taken place,' adding that health and safety protocols 'should always be followed.' 
Pressed by Gomez about what the department would do if untrained employees were exposed to the virus, Azar said: 'I'd want to know the full facts, and we'd take appropriate remedial efforts.'
The whistleblower said she received an email Jan. 25 about a potential deployment within ACF to support repatriation of the evacuated Americans, according to one of her lawyers. She initially supported the efforts because they had the 'appearance that this was within ACF's scope,' Naylor said. But later, she discovered the teams were dispatched without her knowledge by other senior officials at HHS. It was part of the agency's 'all-hands-on-deck' mission, Naylor said, but it broke agency protocol about what kinds of employees should respond to health emergencies. 
Some workers expressed concern about the lack of protective gear to the ACF team leader on the ground. That person joined ACF in September and had 'no training or experience in any federal emergency management, public health emergency response, or safety or operational protocols to run the mission,' the complaint states.
ACF personnel typically deal with supporting people recovering from natural disasters, such as floods and fires, the whistleblower's lawyers said. HHS officials broke established protocols for emergency support by sending ACF workers to a health emergency, for which they have no training, Naylor said. ACF, which has about 1,300 employees, has been criticized in recent years because of its role in sheltering and taking custody of migrant children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border and who were separated from family members by the Department of Homeland Security.
The workers' concerns about potential exposure to the coronavirus were not addressed, the whistleblower's lawyers said.
'She was involuntarily assigned to a position in a subject matter where she has no expertise,' Wilkenfeld said Thursday. The agency said the reason for the reassignment was 'necessary to meet the needs of the department,' according to a memo she received. 
'If I did not accept involuntary reassignment, I would be terminated from federal service through adverse personnel action,' her complaint stated.

Global markets have been on a roller-coaster ride the past week. The coronavirus epidemic is spreading rapidly, and analysts say there's no telling how big of a hit the economy will take as a result of the disease. PHOTO: Photo Illustration by Emil Lendof/The Wall Street Journal; Photos: iStock
Global markets have been on a roller-coaster ride the past week. The coronavirus epidemic is spreading rapidly, and analysts say there is no telling how big of a hit the economy will take as a result.
Investors quickly singled out stocks that could lose big if the virus proves especially disruptive, but many also tried to spot winning bets—stocks that might actually benefit from consumers pulling back on their regular activities.
While the S&P 500 suffered its worst two-day stretch in more than four years to start the week, investors found havens in a peanut-butter manufacturer, bleach producer and financial exchanges. They rebuffed going out: Restaurants took a hit, as did concert venues.
Here's our look at what bets have worked this week—and what investors shied away from.
WINNERS
GROCERY SHOPPING:
In times of market duress, investors often turn to shares of bland but essential businesses where households are unlikely to stop spending money. The past week has been no exception. Investors punished shares of peanut-butter giant J.M. Smucker Co. much less than the market as a whole (down 4.2% since the S&P 500 peaked Feb. 19, versus a drop of 12% for the broad stock index) while boosting Clorox Co. (up 2.3%). Viruses aren't about to stop Americans from stocking up their pantries. And they might make disinfectant wipes more popular—especially if the coronavirus spreads further in the U.S.
HEALING:
Pharmaceutical companies have raced to develop treatments effective against Covid-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus. Investors have placed their bets accordingly, wagering any company that wins approval to roll out a vaccine for the masses stands to profit handsomely. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., which has partnered with the Department of Health and Human Services to develop antibody treatments, has risen 7.7% since Feb. 19.
TRADING:
Exchanges and high-speed trading firms tend to make more money when markets are volatile. That means the market's gyrations over the past couple of days have been a boon to companies like CME Group Inc. (up 1.4% since Feb. 19), which experienced record volumes Tuesday as traders used its futures to place bets or hedge against market moves. Another beneficiary: rival exchange operator Cboe Global Markets Inc. (up 0.7%), which makes much of its money from products tied to its Cboe Volatility Index. Then there is electronic-trading giant Virtu Financial Inc. (up 5.4%). Volatility tends to benefit speedy traders like Virtu by allowing them to make more money from dislocations in stock prices. CME, Cboe and Virtu "perversely benefit from the market woes," Piper Sandler analysts said in a research note Wednesday.
PIZZA NIGHT:
Most restaurant stocks have fallen lately. Not Domino's Pizza Inc. The pizza chain has soared 17%, with much of the gains coming after the company fended off competition from rivals like UberEats and DoorDash to post better-than-expected earnings and revenue on Feb. 20. Will the spread of the virus stop the rally? Executives aren't concerned yet. "I don't see this as a long-term impact on the business," Richard Allison, chief executive of Domino's, said on the company's earnings call. In fact, food-delivery services have become lifelines for millions of people quarantined in China. It is possible U.S. companies with dominant positions in the delivery business will benefit as well.
LOSERS
GOING OUT:
With the possibility that more people will be staying home, shares of companies that offer a fun time out have dropped more than the broader market. Among entertainment shares, Cinemark Holdings Inc. has fallen 22%, Dave &Buster's Entertainment Inc. has shed 28%, and Madison Square Garden Co. has lost 16%. Restaurant shares have also declined: Shake Shack Inc. has dropped 19%, and BJ's Restaurants Inc. has swooned 26%.
TRAVELING:
Canceled your travel plans lately? So have many others. Investors have used the disruption as an opportunity to bet against shares of airlines, cruise companies and resorts—all of which have lagged behind the broader market since reports of the epidemic first began surfacing. American Airlines Group Inc. shares have sunk 27%, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. is down 31%, and MGM Resorts International is down 21%.
ENERGY:
If travel is restricted, there will be less demand for gasoline to drive cars and for fuel to fly airplanes. Factories that are closed and offices that have sent their workers home also won't be using as much energy as usual—meaning oil-fired power plants will be less busy. All of that bodes poorly for the energy sector. U.S. crude-oil futures are down 12% since Feb. 19. Shares of oil-field services companies Halliburton Co. and Schlumberger Ltd. have declined 22% over the same period.

Bets on Interest Rate Cuts Escalate; Investors have dramatically reassessed the chances that the Fed will lower interest rates soon

Investors have dramatically reassessed the chances that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates as soon as next month, betting the coronavirus will force the central bank's hand despite recent statements from officials indicating they aren't yet convinced that action is needed.
Federal-funds futures, which traders use to bet on the path of central-bank policy, showed Thursday afternoon that investors thought there was a 72% chance the Fed will lower its key policy rate by a quarter-percentage point at its March 17-18 meeting, according to CME Group data. That was up from just 9% a week ago,
Investors also saw an 83% chance the Fed will cut rates by at least 0.50 percentage point by the end of its July meeting and a 46% chance it will cut rates 0.75 percentage point by that time.
In a speech Tuesday, Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said disruptions from the viral outbreak in China "could spill over to the rest of the global economy" but that it is too soon to "even speculate about either the size or the persistence of these effects, or whether they will lead to a material change in the outlook."
Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said this week that he didn't "see any urgent need to move until we have more information." Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said officials are "weeks away from being able to make the judgment" about whether a rate change is needed.
Some analysts have said that interest-rate cuts could have limited power to repair economic damage caused by the coronavirus because lower rates—which are meant to encourage investment—can do little to open closed factories or encourage people to leave their homes.
Others argue that rate cuts could have a significant impact in part by preventing panic on Wall Street.
Investors' confidence that the Fed will cut rates is evident in the low yields on U.S. government bonds . Investors are willing to buy two-year Treasury notes, for example, even though they yield significantly less than short-term rates set by the Fed—a circumstance that can lead to losses for many traders.
As it stands, the Fed's key policy rate is set between 1.5% and 1.75%, while the two-year Treasury note is yielding around 1.1%, according to Tradeweb.

WPP Shares Plunge on Ad Giant's Gloomy Outlook; World's largest advertising company is battling client losses and stepped-up competition

Shares of WPP PLC plunged to their lowest level in almost a decade after the world's largest advertising company said sales would be flat for 2020, adding more pressure on Chief Executive Mark Read.
WPP said organic revenue—a closely watched measurement of its underlying operating performance—declined 1.9% in the fourth quarter, compared with the 0.8% decline analysts forecast.
WPP shares were down about 16% Thursday, hitting their lowest level since 2012.
Like much of the advertising sector, WPP is grappling with a raft of challenges including increased competition from tech giants such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc., and consulting firms such as Accenture.
The British company, which owns agencies such as Wunderman Thompson and GroupM, is in the midst of a three-year turnaround plan after it was stung by losing business from clients such American Express Co. and Ford Motor Co.
WPP said it is too early to predict the effects of the coronavirus epidemic but many in the ad sector are bracing for fallout, since ad companies have operations across the globe.
"The market is worried about their revenue outlook of flat before the impact of the coronavirus and the lack of any margin improvement in 2020," said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Moffett Nathanson. "In addition, after showing improving revenue trends, the fourth quarter performance was a step back."
The downbeat outlook adds more pressure on Mr. Read, who took the reins of WPP in September 2018, after the departure of longtime CEO and founder Martin Sorrell.
Mr. Read has sought to slim down the company to make its operations, which span the globe, less unwieldy for marketers to navigate.
"We are pleased with the progress that we've made, but we're not in any way complacent," said Mr. Read during a conference call with analysts. "We know that we've got work to do." He added that the company has "made significant progress simplifying WPP," pointing out that it has gone from having nine networks of creative ad agencies to five.
For 2019 as a whole, the company said organic sales fell 1.6%. The company's 2020 guidance of flat sales excludes any hit from the coronavirus epidemic. Its projection fell short of analysts' expectations and is well below recent forecasts from rivals such as Omnicom Group Inc. and Interpublic Group of Cos. Earlier this month, Omnicom said it expects organic revenue growth of 2% to 3% for 2020.
In response to the coronavirus , WPP began restricting travel at the end of January, and its current policy is for no travel to China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea or Japan. Only essential business travel is allowed within the Asia-Pacific region or to Italy. Earlier this week, Omnicom closed the London office of one of its subsidiaries until Monday as a precautionary measure after a staff member developed flulike symptoms after returning from Australia via Singapore.
WPP's pretax profit fell to £928.1 million ($1.20 billion) from £1.26 billion with revenue of £13.05 billion. Net profit fell to £62.7 million.
"The second half of 2019 was stronger than the first, with performance improving globally and in the United States, our largest market," Mr. Read said. However, WPP's North American operations were hit by a 5.7% fall in net sales for last year, dragging the group's performance.
Under its turnaround program, launched in December 2018, WPP aims to return the company to sustainable growth in line with its peers in 2021 and operating profit margin of at least 15%.
Russ Mould, investment director at investment platform AJ Bell, said 2020 was supposed to be the year when WPP started to deliver the benefits of its restructuring, but guidance for zero growth this year and the fourth quarter slump in sales seemed "uninspiring" for investors.
"The targets for 2021 have been maintained but the market's patience appears to have snapped," Mr. Mould said in a note to clients.

WASHINGTON--Demand for long-lasting factory goods declined in January, a sign manufacturing began the year on tepid footing.
Orders for durable goods-products designed to last at least three years-fell 0.2% in January from the previous month. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 1.5% decrease.
New orders for transportation equipment were down 2.2%. Orders for civilian aircraft rose, but shipments fell last month. Excluding transportation, a category that can be volatile, orders were up 0.9%.
Orders in December were up a revised 2.9%.
New orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft-or so-called core capital goods orders, a closely watched proxy for business investment-increased 1.1% in January from the previous month.
Another reading on U.S. business investment came out Thursday when the Commerce Department released its estimate of fourth quarter gross domestic product. That measure showed business investment declined in the final three months of 2019.
The durable goods data cover January, a month in which Chinese President Xi Jinping made his first public statement about the coronavirus outbreak. The coronavirus threatens to disrupt global supply chains and further roil travel and output as it spreads to other countries, including South Korea, Japan and Italy.
Federal health authorities said Tuesday they now expect a wider spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. and are preparing for a potential pandemic, though they remain unsure about how severe the health threat could be.

Best Buy Posts Strong Holiday Sales; Retailer said sales rose 3.2% in the latest quarter due to strong demand for phones, appliances and tablets

Best Buy said sales rose over the holiday season, citing strong demand for phones and appliances during a period when many traditional retailers reported lackluster results.
The company said comparable sales increased 3.2% during the fourth quarter ended Feb. 1, marking 12 consecutive quarters of sales growth. In the U.S., online sales grew nearly 19% to $3.52 billion compared with the same quarter last year due to high average order values and more shoppers buying online, the company said.
Categories that helped boost sales included headphones, computing, appliances, mobile phones and tablets, the company said, offset by declines in the gaming category.
"We offered compelling holiday deals that resonated with customers and provided a seamless shopping experience," Chief Executive Corie Barry in a statement.
The retailer's shares fell about 3.5% Thursday morning amid a broader market selloff.
Overall revenue rose 2.7% to $15.2 billion during the most recent quarter. In the U.S., which accounts for the bulk of Best Buy's sales, around a quarter or sales originated online, the company said.
Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas said Best Buy was closely monitoring developments related to the coronavirus outbreak and that it expects most of the impact to be felt in the first half of the year. "We view this as a relatively short-term disruption that does not impact our long-term strategy and initiatives," Mr. Bilunas said in a statement.
Best Buy's results are a positive note amid a holiday sales reporting season marked by lackluster results from many retailers, with some pointing to the shorter holiday buying period and weak toy and electronics sales. The period between Thanksgiving and Christmas was shorter by six days compared with the year before.
Target Corp. fell short of its own expectations, citing weak sales in toys and electronics. Macy's Inc. recently said it would close another 125 of its department stores. Walmart Inc. said fourth-quarter sales came in weaker than the company hoped, due to lackluster demand for toys, apparel and videogames in the last weeks before Christmas.
Best Buy said it expects to report comparable sales of flat to 2% for the current fiscal year and diluted earnings per share of $6.10 to $6.30, which includes the company's estimated impact from coronavirus, the company said.
Best Buy has undergone a significant turnaround in the past six years, avoiding the fate of Circuit City, Sports Authority, Toys 'R' Us and other category killers, retailers that tend to stock goods focused on a single category such as electronics or sports gear. In 2012, the electronics retailer was struggling with falling sales and dwindling profit as consumers browsed at bricks-and-mortar stores but made purchases on Amazon.com and other websites.
The retailer shifted strategies, matching prices to competitors, adding services to reduce the company's reliance on new product releases and using its stores to fulfill online orders. Two years ago Best Buy struck a deal to join with Amazon to sell smart TVs and later acquired GreatCall Inc., the maker of senior-focused devices.
Last summer the architect of that turnaround, Hubert Joly, stepped aside from the chief executive role and Ms. Barry, a longtime Best Buy executive, became CEO. Earlier this year the company said it hired an outside law firm to investigate allegations brought to the board last December that Ms. Barry had an inappropriate romantic relationship with a fellow former executive before she took over as CEO. This month the company said it had concluded the review, leaving Ms. Barry in her role without providing details of the investigation. Ms. Barry, 44 years old, is one of the youngest CEOs of an S&P 500 company and one of few women.
Best Buy's sales growth has slowed somewhat over the past year amid uncertainty about the impact of tariffs on Chinese goods. In November, the company raised its previously lowered sales and profit expectations for the full year. At the time, Best Buy predicted comparable sales growth of 1% to 2% for the year.
For the full fiscal year, comparable sales rose 2.1%.
Net earnings rose slightly to $1.54 billion for the full year, up from $1.46 billion the previous fiscal year.
Diluted earnings per share hit $5.75 for the year, up from $5.20 in the comparable period.

The Invisible Forces Exacerbating Market Swings; Derivatives positioning added to stock swoon

Investors searching for clues on what drove the back-to-back drops in the stock market are pointing to the options market as a contributor, saying hedging activity by traders may have exacerbated the decline. PHOTO: Emil Lendof/The Wall Street Journal
The rapid spread of the coronavirus outside China spurred turmoil in financial markets this week. Investors say hedging activity by options traders might have made it even worse.
Market volatility has roared back, smashing a streak of tranquility that helped pull major U.S. stock indexes to records just days earlier. Waves of selling dominated the week and the S&P 500 closed down Thursday more than 10% from its recent high, a decline known as a correction . The selloff sent listed options activity to the second-highest level ever earlier this week.
A surge of coronavirus cases outside China stoked worries that the epidemic would weigh on global growth, as businesses remained shut and travel was curtailed around the world.
There were technical factors at play, too. Derivatives activity and heavy selling from funds that tend to make knee-jerk buying and selling decisions based on the level of market volatility created a perfect storm for the Wall Street selloff, analysts said. The S&P 500 fell for the sixth consecutive session Thursday, logging its biggest percentage decline since August 2011.
Marko Kolanovic, global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy at JPMorgan Chase &Co., estimated that more than $100 billion in selling Monday and Tuesday was fueled by options hedging and trading strategies based on market volatility. Meanwhile, liquidity—or the ability to get in and out of positions—also worsened, Mr. Kolanovic said, further stressing the broader market.
To some investors, this highlights the increased influence that options activity and different trading tactics can have on markets, as new strategies to juice returns have surged in popularity in recent years.
"It has been a big contributor to the increase in volatility," said Vincent Cassot, head of equity derivatives strategy at Société Générale SA, of options positioning. "We can switch quickly from a very low volatility world."
Options trading has swelled, particularly as investors have gotten more creative in their search for higher returns during a period of ultralow bond yields. The activity can help suppress market swings , keeping stocks calm for extended periods.
Share Your Thoughts
Do you place blame for market swings on the options market? Join the conversation below.
It can also have the opposite effect, magnifying volatility when it appears. That scenario may have been on display this week because of what is called short gamma positioning, in which traders buy shares when prices are rising and sell when prices are falling.
Gamma measures how much the price of an option accelerates when the price of the underlying security shifts. Tracking this exposure has become more popular on Wall Street, with some strategists saying that it can fuel big moves—higher or lower—in stocks.
"You just had the right place, right time for a shock down" this week, said Charlie McElligott, a cross-asset macro strategist at Nomura. "The conditions were ripe because of gamma."
Mr. McElligott wrote in a note to clients Tuesday that this dynamic added to the stock swoon that day, as traders sold more stocks the lower prices fell.
"Dealers are in the 'short Gamma' zone, and that added to the move to the downside [Monday], as they generically speaking were sellers the lower we traveled," wrote Mr. McElligott.
Data provider SqueezeMetrics estimates that tens of billions of dollars of S&P 500 futures had to be sold for every percentage point the S&P 500 went down earlier week.
Here's how it works: Investors often turn to the options market to buy and sell contracts tied to the S&P 500. They can buy S&P 500 put options from options dealers, who take the other side of the trade. Such contracts tend to profit as the stock gauge falls, and can serve as a portfolio hedge.
As the S&P 500 declines, those put options become more profitable for the investor who purchased them. Meanwhile, the trade sours for the seller. Professional options dealers try to maintain neutral positions in the market and remain constantly hedged. As markets fall, options dealers sell stocks or stock futures to offset those positions. The selling can intensify the more stocks fall.
"You're going to be a seller when the market is down," said Mr. Cassot. "Hence they are going to increase the volatility of the market,"
An accelerating selloff and rising stock volatility can trigger other investors to make similar decisions, creating a ripple effect. A whole camp of funds on Wall Street makes trading decisions based on the level of swings in markets. They tend to sell when volatility rises and buy when volatility falls. One measure of stock swings, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, on Monday jumped to its highest level since January 2019 and continued to rise the next day. It closed Thursday at its highest level since August 2015.
"In addition to broad risk-off sentiment from the virus, significant drivers of price action was selling from systematic strategies and option hedgers," wrote Mr. Kolanovic in a note to clients Wednesday.
As the selloff intensified Monday, some investors looked to bet on volatility itself. Some of the most popular options changing hands were those tied to the VIX, and an exchange-traded product tied to VIX derivatives, the iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Exchange-Traded Note. Options volumes tied to the VIX hit the highest level since May this week.

The dynamic could continue if stocks continue to fall. The options activity could similarly spark a big rally in stocks. Just as options dealers may have to sell stocks as markets are falling, they may have to buy stocks as they are rising to stay hedged.
Options activity by trading firms could "noticeably and meaningfully add to the extremity of market moves," said Mark Sebastian, a trader and founder of Option Pit, which gives courses on options.

Global markets have been on a roller-coaster ride the past week. The coronavirus epidemic is spreading rapidly, and analysts say there is no telling how big of a hit the economy will take as a result.
Investors quickly singled out stocks that could lose big if the virus proves especially disruptive, but many also tried to spot winning bets—stocks that might actually benefit from consumers pulling back on their regular activities.
While the S&P 500 suffered its worst two-day stretch in more than four years to start the week, investors found havens in a peanut-butter manufacturer, bleach producer and financial exchanges. They rebuffed going out: Restaurants took a hit, as did concert venues.
Here's our look at what bets have worked this week—and what investors shied away from.
WINNERS
GROCERY SHOPPING:
In times of market duress, investors often turn to shares of bland but essential businesses where households are unlikely to stop spending money. The past week has been no exception. Investors punished shares of peanut-butter giant J.M. Smucker Co. much less than the market as a whole (down 4.2% since the S&P 500 peaked Feb. 19, versus a drop of 12% for the broad stock index) while boosting Clorox Co. (up 2.4%). Viruses aren't about to stop Americans from stocking up their pantries. And they might make disinfectant wipes more popular—especially if the coronavirus spreads further in the U.S.
HEALING:
Pharmaceutical companies have raced to develop treatments effective against Covid-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus. Investors have placed their bets accordingly, wagering any company that wins approval to roll out a vaccine for the masses stands to profit handsomely. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., which has partnered with the Department of Health and Human Services to develop antibody treatments, has risen 7.7% since Feb. 19.
TRADING:
Exchanges and high-speed trading firms tend to make more money when markets are volatile. That means the market's gyrations over the past couple of days have been a boon to companies like CME Group Inc. (up 1.4% since Feb. 19), which experienced record volumes Tuesday as traders used its futures to place bets or hedge against market moves. Another beneficiary: rival exchange operator Cboe Global Markets Inc. (up 2.8%), which makes much of its money from products tied to its Cboe Volatility Index. Then there is electronic-trading giant Virtu Financial Inc. (up 5.4%). Volatility tends to benefit speedy traders like Virtu by allowing them to make more money from dislocations in stock prices. CME, Cboe and Virtu "perversely benefit from the market woes," Piper Sandler analysts said in a research note Wednesday.
PIZZA NIGHT:
Most restaurant stocks have fallen lately. Not Domino's Pizza Inc. The pizza chain has soared 17%, with much of the gains coming after the company fended off competition from rivals like UberEats and DoorDash to post better-than-expected earnings and revenue on Feb. 20. Will the spread of the virus stop the rally? Executives aren't concerned yet. "I don't see this as a long-term impact on the business," Richard Allison, chief executive of Domino's, said on the company's earnings call. In fact, food-delivery services have become lifelines for millions of people quarantined in China. It is possible U.S. companies with dominant positions in the delivery business will benefit as well.
LOSERS
GOING OUT:
With the possibility that more people will be staying home, shares of companies that offer a fun time out have dropped more than the broader market. Among entertainment shares, Cinemark Holdings Inc. has fallen 22%, Dave &Buster's Entertainment Inc. has shed 28%, and Madison Square Garden Co. has lost 16%. Restaurant shares have also declined: Shake Shack Inc. has dropped 19%, and BJ's Restaurants Inc. has swooned 26%.
TRAVELING:
Canceled your travel plans lately? So have many others. Investors have used the disruption as an opportunity to bet against shares of airlines, cruise companies and resorts—all of which have lagged behind the broader market since reports of the epidemic first began surfacing. American Airlines Group Inc. shares have sunk 27%, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. is down 31%, and MGM Resorts International is down 21%.
ENERGY:
If travel is restricted, there will be less demand for gasoline to drive cars and for fuel to fly airplanes. Factories that are closed and offices that have sent their workers home also won't be using as much energy as usual—meaning oil-fired power plants will be less busy. All of that bodes poorly for the energy sector. U.S. crude-oil futures are down 12% since Feb. 19. Shares of oil-field services companies Halliburton Co. and Schlumberger Ltd. have declined 22% over the same period.

Classrooms Closed, an Entire City Home Schools --- Hong Kong students learn online as parents work alongside

In Hong Kong, the home of schools that are the envy of high-achieving and aspirational parents everywhere, education is making a huge shift.
To the dining room.
Concerns about coronavirus have led to a two-month school closure for the city's 800,000 students, prompting a crash course in digital learning.
Instead of calling off lessons, many schools expect students to keep up their work online, sending them assignments to complete and submit for grading. Six-year-olds are writing nonfiction books and toddlers are having live video interactions with nursery-school teachers.
The academic experiment has children and their parents, many of whom also have to work at home because their offices are closed, crammed into the same space. It's a potential harbinger of what might face the U.S. if the virus continues to spread.
Karen Taylor, whose three children attend an English-language international school, used to send them off in the morning and return to their 1,100-square-foot apartment to work remotely as a manager at a software company. Since early February, her 5-year-old and her 10-year-old twins have been mostly cooped up at home, attending virtual lessons that include video meetings with classmates and teachers.
"I can't watch every single one of them all of the time," said Ms. Taylor, who has put up the children's schedules on the dining-room wall.
Her husband, Paul Crowe, who still goes to the office, helps with homework after he gets home and sometimes works on the apartment's balcony. Ms. Taylor has struggled to help her kids with fractions and long-division problems -- "I only vaguely remember doing that at school" -- and has caught them watching videos on YouTube during lesson time. Recently, the twins' teachers stopped classroom-wide Google Hangouts and moved to smaller online class groups.
Teresa Liu's 3-year-old son Zachary started online classes this month. In video meetings, his preschool teachers told stories in English, Mandarin and Cantonese and talked about the importance of wearing masks and washing their hands.
Zachary paid attention for the first few minutes, but when teachers asked questions to other children, he lost interest and left his seat to climb on chairs and the table.
"He's pretty active," said Ms. Liu, adding that her family's domestic helper had to chase him around to try to sit him in front of the teacher on the computer screen. Ms. Liu said they intend to stick with the online lessons so he stays connected with his school and teachers.
Hong Kong, a densely populated city with 7.5 million people, has so far reported 91 confirmed coronavirus cases. Following a week-long Lunar New Year holiday, the government closed all schools starting Feb. 3 and said they won't reopen until it is safe for students to congregate again. The earliest date schools could reopen is April 20. City education officials have advised schools to embrace online learning. In a press briefing, they demonstrated virtual learning platforms to help convince the public that they could be effective alternatives to school.
Principals and teachers are using different modes, including online learning, to help students continue studies at home and have achieved the goal of "suspending classes without suspending learning," said Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung.
On Facebook, a Hong Kong parents group has posts from people worrying about children falling behind on important exam prep, complaining about balancing full-time jobs with supervising schoolwork or just missing having their kids out of the house for most of the day.
In mainland China, schools were on holiday until mid-February but now those closures have been extended and some are experimenting with online learning. South Korea has also closed some schools.
International schools in Hong Kong, where fees generally range between $10,000 and $22,000 a year, have been especially active online.
At the Harbour School, an American international school, students are required to keep up with virtual lessons that follow regular class timetables. Second-graders have to write multipage lab reports after watching their teachers perform live demonstrations of science experiments shown on camera, while kindergartners have to make recordings of themselves reading words. "It's as compulsory as a given regular school day is," said Christine Greenberg, its prep and primary school principal.
Tarana Shah, who works full time at a French investment bank, said she has been spending a large part of her nonworking hours helping her 6-year-old daughter Isha finish assigned school work. One weekend, they assembled a 12-page book titled "How To Take Care Of A Cocker Spaniel."
"It's so exhausting because that is all we were doing through the day," said Ms. Shah, who spends part of her lunch breaks printing out worksheets for her daughter.
She uses a spreadsheet to keep track of assignments and submissions to teachers, but she's trying not to worry if a few things fall through the cracks. "I realized that she's six, it's OK if she learns five things less than the other kids in her class," she said.
Ms. Taylor, who has been trying to juggle working at home and online schooling, decided to send her 10-year-old twins to Chicago to stay with her in-laws, to break the boredom of being stuck at home. She worries the children could have fallen behind when school eventually reopens. "There will be all these other kids who have that two or three months of incredibly intensive home schooling," she said.

Intelligent Investor: Pros Must Sell Stocks Now. You Don't Have To

When markets crumple, the culprits usually aren't the smallest investors, but the biggest.
So far, most individual investors have remained steadfast as stocks have been pummeled by fears that the coronavirus could turn into a pandemic. If they continue to keep their cool, small investors might even get to buy bargains as the big money bails out.
Professional investors tend to move the fastest when a market suddenly turns. That's largely out of self-preservation, because the biggest risk they face is being so out of step with the market that their clients fire them. That can lead the pros to chase the market trend too far and too long.
"Institutions sell more than individuals when there is a large stock-market drop," finance professors Patrick Dennis and Deon Strickland found in a 2002 study. They also showed that the more widely a stock is held by big investors, the greater its trading volume during sharp market drops.
And the stocks dumped by the biggest investors on down days tend to outperform the market over the ensuing six months. Selling by institutions when the market falls at least 2% "drives prices below their true values," the researchers concluded.
Patience is a luxury that individual investors can afford. Money managers must focus not only on analyzing what assets are worth, but also on "anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be," as John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1936.
That's because the pros are in a never-ending struggle to attract new funds. For professionals seeking to maximize their fees, it is rational -- at least in the short run -- to buy even more of the most-overvalued stocks when their prices are rising.
Once performance falters, portfolio managers who owned -- and then sold -- the most popular stocks won't be punished as badly as those who made unorthodox picks. "Worldly wisdom," wrote Keynes, "teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally."
When institutions sell, they often get rid of their most liquid holdings first, because those are the easiest to sell at the best price.
A survey of more than 16,000 individual investors by Vanguard Group shows how drastically their attitudes differ from those of big institutions.
Vanguard has been repeating this survey every two months since early 2017. The results suggest that individual investors have become a major force for moderation in the financial markets.
Individuals consistently expect U.S. stocks to return about 5% over the coming year, the Vanguard survey shows. That's only half the historical average of 10% annually, counting dividends.
Among those individuals, nearly 60% forecast one-year returns between 0% and 6%, and just under 70% predict 10-year average annual returns in that same range. Professional investors often project returns in excess of 7.5% annually.
After stocks stumble, the survey shows, individual investors do predict lower future returns -- but not by much. And when stocks are doing well, these investors make rosier forecasts -- by a small margin.
From September through December 2018, as stocks fell almost 20%, the Vanguard investors' forecasts of returns over the coming year fell to 2.7% from 4.8%.
By February 2019, however, as the market bounced back, investors projected that stocks would earn 4.9% over the next 12 months.
But, the Vanguard survey finds, these investors don't tend to buy more stocks when they become a little more optimistic or to sell when they turn a bit pessimistic. Unlike professionals, they often change their opinions without feeling obligated to act on them.
Of course, Vanguard's clients might be less interested than the general investing public in chasing hot returns, trading frequently or trying to time the market.
According to Vanguard researchers Stephen Utkus and Jean Young, the typical investor in the survey is 61 years old and has been a client for 17 years. The median account value is about $221,000, with about 72% in stocks. The typical annual turnover -- a measure of how often an investor moves money around -- is only 10%. (Mutual-fund managers trade at more than six times that rate, according to Morningstar.)
So the people in Vanguard's survey might be unusually placid. And individual investors, overall, have been rewarded for their patience so long that there is some risk they have turned complacent.
This is the longest bull market on record, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices -- running more than 131 months without a 20% decline from its latest high closing price.
Over that period, stocks have returned more than 490%, including dividends. Last year alone, the S&P 500 rose 32%.
A big tumble would shake that confidence.
Let's remember, though, that panic is rare -- in markets and in life. During the Nazi bombardment of Britain in World War II, most people remained so levelheaded that the "neurosis centres" opened by the government to counteract the expected effects of mass panic were seldom used.
No one knows how far the fear over coronavirus will extend or how much stocks will fall in response. What we can be fairly sure of is that individual investors are likely to be among the last -- not the first -- to sell.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell Wednesday for the fifth consecutive session as investors continued to assess the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic.
Both indexes opened sharply higher, and the Dow climbed as much as 461 points before turning negative in afternoon trading. The blue-chip index closed with a drop of 123.77 points, or 0.5%, to 26957.59 -- down more than 8% from a week ago.
The S&P 500 slid 11.82 points, or 0.4%, to 3116.39. The Nasdaq Composite added 15.16 points, or 0.2%, to 8980.77, pushing back into positive territory for the year.
The Dow and S&P 500 are off 5.5% and 3.5%, respectively, in 2020.
Investors were hoping for markets to stabilize after the Dow fell more than 1,900 points Monday and Tuesday in its largest two-day point decline on record. Markets were spooked this week by a growing number of coronavirus cases outside China and fears that the epidemic would dent corporate earnings and global growth.
"This is a time of peak uncertainty for coronavirus," said Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald. "We don't yet know the size of how much it's spread or the mortality rate. That's what markets are reacting to, peak uncertainty, rather than facts."
Brazil and Pakistan reported their first cases of the virus on Wednesday, with Brazil's being the first confirmed case in Latin America. Officials in Nassau County, outside of New York City, said they were monitoring 83 people for possible exposure.
Switzerland-based Nestle suspended overseas business travel for its employees, one of the strictest such measures taken by a multinational in response to the epidemic.
Investors continued to seek safety in government bonds, pushing Treasury yields lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell to 1.310%, a record, from 1.328% Tuesday.
Yields have been under pressure in recent days in part because of a growing expectation among investors that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates at least two times later this year.
Volatility in U.S. equity markets remained high. The Cboe Volatility Index, a closely watched measure of market turbulence known as VIX, fell 1% to 27.56, a day after hitting its highest levels in more than a year.
In Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 was flat for the day after wavering between gains and losses.
Asian markets closed lower. Japan's Nikkei 225 index shed 0.8% to reach its lowest level since October. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dropped 2.3% and South Korea's Kospi fell 1.3%. Early Thursday, the Nikkei was down 1.8%, the S&P/ASX was down 1.1% and the Kospi was off 0.9%.
Crude-oil prices fell for the fourth consecutive session. U.S. oil futures dropped 2.3% to settle at $48.73 a barrel. Oil futures had picked up earlier Wednesday, after data showed U.S. crude inventories rising less than expected, but then gave up their gains.
Many European and Asian benchmarks, including those in Germany, Japan, and South Korea, are solidly in negative territory for the year.

Supply Chains Are at Risk --- If China's shutdown lengthens, the damage to overseas customers will grow

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
[This is the second column in a five part Heard on the Street series about the market and economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic.]
Investors are used to the cliche about butterfly wings in Brazil and tornadoes in Texas. It turns out that the butterfly -- or bat, to be strictly accurate -- was actually in China. Where the tornado will end is the big unknown.
The spread of new pneumonia-causing coronavirus probably originating in bats has shut down much of China. Companies as diverse as Apple, Hyundai Motor and Indian drugmakers are suddenly finding that parts from the world's factories are unavailable, and the epidemic continues to spread rapidly in South Korea, Japan and even Italy. The first crisis test of the complex global supply chains favored by multinationals since the 1990s could be here.
Disasters have disrupted Asian supply chains before, but there is no real analog for the virus now spreading world-wide. When severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, emerged from China in 2003, it infected just 10% as many people, and China's weight in global exports is twice what it was then. Today's intricate global supply chains are also a relatively recent development and certainly didn't exist in 1918, when the "Spanish flu" pandemic devastated many countries around the world.
Amid all the unknowns for manufacturing, one certainty is that timing will matter a lot. If China can't contain the epidemic within the next few weeks and get back to work, the risk of serious damage to local suppliers -- and worse, shortages of Chinese parts abroad -- will rise sharply. A recent survey found that about two-thirds of Chinese small and medium-size businesses had less than three months' cash on hand.
The ripple effect in industries like autos has so far been worst in nearby countries including South Korea and Japan, where manufacturers are used to short delivery times and lower inventories rather than a monthlong trip across the Pacific for parts. But if China's shutdown stretches from one month into two, the damage to overseas customers will be more widespread.
Under any scenario, the worst-hit industries will be those like automobiles and electronics with specialized components whose supply chain is clustered in one country or a small group of countries. China is the world's largest exporter but in 2014 still only accounted for about 8% of such "risky" hard-to-replace products, according to researchers at the International Monetary Fund. The U.S. and Germany both clocked in at 13%. What happens in those countries may end up being the real acid test for global supply chains.
Worryingly, some pharmaceutical products and medical devices are in the risky category, raising the possibility that drug production gums up just as global demand for pharmaceuticals to combat the virus leaps.
Multinationals in China are taking a wait-and-see approach. An early February survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai found that half of respondents weren't considering a change to their China strategy, while 40% said it was too early to tell. Investors who only weeks ago were salivating over the prospect of a global rebound now find themselves in the same boat.

U.S. government-bond yields, reversing Wednesday's early rise, were dragged down to fresh all-time lows amid new signs that the coronavirus is spreading.
Investors initially paused in buying Treasurys mostly because yields, which fall as bond prices rise, dropped to record lows Tuesday, traders and analysts said. Demand rose again following reports of new coronavirus cases in places including South America.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury closed Wednesday at 1.310%, down from Tuesday's then-record-low close of 1.328%. The 30-year bond's yield fell to 1.796% from 1.803% Tuesday.
The record-low yields in Treasurys suggest investors see a relatively high chance that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates soon, but so far economic indicators don't bear that up, said Thomas Simmons, an economist at Jefferies LLC.
Economic fallout from the virus isn't likely to have a material impact on the U.S. economy until the second quarter of the year, and it will take more time for that data to be disseminated, Mr. Simmons said. Fed officials next meet to consider changing interest rates in mid-March.
"The 10-year broke through a record-low yield yesterday, and it's hard to see the market going much further absent more bad news," he said.
Bonds of energy companies weakened Wednesday as investors braced for more bad news from oil and gas producers.
Chesapeake Energy Corp.'s bond due 2025 fell to 66.75 cents Wednesday after the company reported a decline in revenue, down from 72.25 Tuesday, according to data from BondTicker.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called on the federal government Wednesday to expand the testing for coronavirus to travelers beyond China, saying an increased vigilance is needed to stop the spread of the disease.
There haven't been any confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York, but health officials have been on "high alert" since January.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that it expects a wider spread of the virus throughout the U.S. and is preparing for a potential pandemic.
During a news conference on the city's preparedness, Mr. de Blasio said the federal government should expand the protocol to test travelers from any country that has seen a surge in cases, including Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.
Roughly 19,000 passengers who have traveled in China within 14 days have been screened at John F. Kennedy International Airport since Jan. 17, according to John Bilich, chief security officer for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport.
Both New York City and state officials asked the federal government to allow their labs to join with the CDC in testing for the virus.
"We don't have the authorization to do the test here, we have to rely on the CDC," said Oxiris Barbot, the city's health commissioner.
The city initially received permission to run the test, but there are issues concerning the final step of the process, Dr. Barbot said. The testing process has been in a "silo," the mayor said.
At a separate news conference, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he is seeking an emergency appropriation of an additional $40 million for the state's Department of Health to use for equipment and personnel. He deferred to the federal government as to whether more travelers should be tested.
Across New York, 27 people have been tested for coronavirus, state officials said Wednesday. Almost all of those patients were deemed not to be infected, with one test pending.
Still, Messrs. Cuomo and de Blasio have said that a patient with coronavirus likely could appear in New York given the large number of international arrivals.
"We're preparing, but this situation is not a situation that should cause undue fear among people," Mr. Cuomo said. "Yes, it is a serious illness, has a higher mortality rate than the flu, etcetera, but not like Ebola."
The city has distributed 1.5 million protective face masks, mostly to health-care professions. Officials have requested 300,000 additional masks, and have asked the federal government to step in to expedite the production of masks.
"We have the greatest public-health capacity anywhere in this country, and we're using it," Mr. de Blasio said.

Virus could sicken global economy; As the ripple effects of the disease become clearer, a recession is increasingly likely, economists say.

As the coronavirus outbreak enters a potentially dangerous new phase, with cases widening in Europe and expected to spread in the United States, economists have begun to raise their estimates for the risk of a global recession and fallout to the American economy.
Economists say the stock market sell-off in recent days reflects a reassessment of the likely magnitude of the hit to corporate earnings in the virus' wake, suggesting the economic pain could last longer and the recovery may not be as swift as initially thought.
"Businesses of all kinds, in a lot of places, being impaired really [made] me skeptical that this is something that would fade quickly and from which we would recover quickly," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago. "And that realization is now cascading through, both to investors and to policymakers, that this is a situation that is more serious than initially thought."
Many American companies rely on overseas sales and production in China for a significant share of their revenue and profits. And a growing number of firms, including Apple, Starbucks and chipmaker Qualcomm, have lowered their earnings guidance in recent days.
Tannenbaum now sees the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by a quarter of a point in April. Just a few weeks ago, he and many other analysts expected the central bank would stand pat on rates for the rest of the year.
Fed officials aren't sounding alarm bells yet, but say they're closely monitoring the situation. And while they don't want to react to volatile swings in financial markets, deepening losses in stocks could undercut consumer confidence, which in turn could cause a retrenchment in spending and push the economy into recession.
Oil prices, Treasury yields and stock indexes all have sunk this week. The Dow lost ground for a fifth straight session Wednesday and is now down more than 8% from a week ago.
"The equity market is central to the U.S. economy," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, noting that the large baby boom population is particularly susceptible to a market downturn because they have much of their nest egg in it.
Zandi considered the rapid spread of the virus in Italy a major turning point, and after Tuesday's warning from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that infections were bound to increase in the United States, he raised the odds of a global recession to 50%, up from just 20% last week.
"If it goes to a pandemic, then I think the economy is in recession," he said.
The World Health Organization hasn't yet classified the outbreak as a pandemic. As of late Wednesday, its daily tracking reported more than 81,000 confirmed cases in more than 36 countries, with the death toll exceeding 2,750, the vast majority in China. The rate of increase in cases is now fastest outside of China.
In fact, China, where the COVID-19 virus was first detected in December, has seen a steady decline in reports of new infections in recent days. And key parts of the Chinese economy, which had been in virtual lockdown, have picked up notably as many operations have resumed.
But even as things look better in China, a surge of new cases in South Korea, Italy and Iran has sparked fears that the economic impact will only widen as other countries, and the companies that operate there, adopt similarly stringent responses to keep the virus in check, such as travel restrictions and temporary closures of factories and businesses.
In the face of heightened uncertainties, some companies are taking more extreme measures. Nestle this week told all of its 291,000 employees worldwide to hold off on business travel until the middle of next month.
Even before the virus outbreak, the global economy was smarting from President Trump's trade wars, uncertainties about Brexit and rising tensions in South America and the Middle East.
Now it looks like several major economies -- Japan, Germany, Italy, South Korea -- could slide into a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
Fed officials seemed unruffled by the stock market declines, or that the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to an all-time low Tuesday as investors fled riskier assets for the safety of U.S. government bonds.
Fed Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida, speaking at an economic conference in Washington on Tuesday afternoon, said that "it is still too soon to even speculate about either the size or the persistence of these effects, or whether they will lead to a material change in the outlook."
Clarida added that the U.S. economy and the central bank's current monetary policy were both in a "good place," essentially repeating public comments made by Fed Chairman Jerome H. Powell two weeks ago.
Trump's chief economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, has insisted that even if the rest of the world tumbled into recession, the U.S. could remain an island of prosperity.
"Right here we're doing awfully well now," he said on CNBC on Tuesday as stocks were rapidly falling.
"We have contained this," he said. "I won't say airtight, but it's pretty close to airtight." As of Wednesday there were at least 60 confirmed cases in the U.S., with no deaths.
Trump, who returned Wednesday from a trip to India, appeared frustrated by the increased concern at home and sought to reassure Americans in an evening news conference.
In a tweet earlier Wednesday, he praised his administration's response to the virus, and lashed out at the news media for making the coronavirus "look as bad as possible, including panicking markets."
Trump has frequently touted the stock market gains under his watch, something that he sees as a validation of his stewardship of the economy ahead of the November election.
U.S. job growth, in particular, has held up very well. And the Fed's low interest rates have given a boost to the housing market and are helping household balance sheets.
At the same time, corporate debts are high, manufacturing remains in recession and business investment is sluggish. Analysts say it's possible the U.S. could skirt a recession in a global downturn, but it'll be close.
Research firm Oxford Economics this week also revised its outlook, writing that "the economic impact to the U.S. and global economy was believed to be mostly contained last week, but rising volatility, plunging stock prices, and a strengthening dollar will likely exacerbate the economic shock on the U.S. economy."
Even if the world avoids a coronavirus pandemic, Oxford Economics said the U.S. economy will barely be able to stay above water in the first quarter and that growth for the year as a whole was likely to come in at a subpar rate of 1.5%.
One of the biggest threats is interruptions in global supply chains, the network of manufacturers, vendors, distributors and transporters needed to get goods from factories to customers.
Despite Kudlow's assertion that "there's no supply disruptions out there yet," many companies and analysts in various industries can attest otherwise.
IPC, an electronics industry trade group, said this week that manufacturers were already hurting, and surveys indicate they are expecting, on average, product shipment delays of at least five weeks.
Said John Mitchell, IPC's president and chief executive: "The delays will likely have ripple effects for the rest of the year."

In the weeks before she was diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, South Korea's Patient No. 31 busily went about her daily life.
The 61-year-old resident of Daegu traveled to Seoul's bustling Gangnam district to visit her company headquarters. She commuted to her work selling mobile gift certificates, ate her fill at a hotel buffet and went to a traditional medicine clinic after getting into a minor car accident.
Twice, she attended Sunday services at the Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, where she prayed shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of other followers.
Within hours of her positive COVID-19 test on Feb. 18, South Korean authorities released a detailed accounting of her whereabouts and addresses of each location she'd visited. "Patient No. 31 movements" shot up as a trending search topic on South Korean web portals. Authorities then set out identifying, locating and testing the hundreds of people who'd crossed paths with her -- and when they found those she'd infected, the thousands more who'd crossed paths with them.
Patient No. 31 is not alone in having her comings and goings mapped. Through smartphone push alerts, blog posts and regular briefings streamed live on YouTube, authorities here are publicizing the whereabouts and movements of the more than 1,000 confirmed COVID-19 patients. It's a contrast to governments elsewhere that have been wary of disclosing too much identifying information out of privacy concerns and for fear of stoking panic.
Governments around the world are scrambling to slow down, if not stop, the spread of the virus that's ravaged China and has sprung up in 40 countries and counting. With scientists and public health officials still learning about how and when the virus spreads and just how dangerous it is, South Korea is proving an early -- if invasive -- experiment in how to deal with a fast-evolving epidemic.
Largely informed by public criticism of how it withheld information during a local outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2015, South Korea is erring on the side of radical transparency: aggressively and almost instantaneously pushing information out to the public about each active case.
The efficacy of South Korea's approach remains to be seen. Containment still appeared far off as South Korea's Centers for Disease Control said Wednesday that it had confirmed 12 fatalities and 1,261 cases, nearly 600 of which were associated with the cluster relating to the Shincheonji church. A U.S. soldier stationed at a base near Daegu has also tested positive for the virus, becoming the first service member to be infected, the U.S. military said Wednesday.
South Korea accounts for the largest number of patients outside China, yet may not be alone -- public health experts suspect other countries may have hundreds or thousands of undetected infections because they've been less aggressive than South Korea in contact tracing and publicizing instances of potential exposure. Other nations may also lack the testing capacity. South Korea has run about 30,000 tests, many of them over the last week.
The zealous effort to identify all potential cases has meant a granular level of detail. Based on interviews, credit card statements and CCTV footage, officials are retracing the steps of each infected patient and asking members of the public to get tested if they may have been exposed and were experiencing symptoms.
Emergency push alerts accompanied by screeching alarms asked: Were you at the hot springs in the city of Yeongju at 5:30 p.m. on Feb. 17, or at a particular yoga class in Andong after 2 p.m. on Feb. 18? Were you at a singing class in Busan on Feb. 22, or in Gimhae on Bus 128-1 between 8:36 a.m. and 8:52 a.m. on Feb. 17?
"It's very good from a public health perspective, having that kind of contact tracing," said Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard's T. H. Chan School of Public Health, who said the detailed data will be crucial to experts around the world studying how quickly and through what routes the virus transmits.
At the same time, he said authorities should be sensitive to the varying degrees of public tolerance in releasing potentially identifying details.
"That can be very cultural. The U.S. has a really strict culture of wanting very, very limited information shared," he said. "Whether to make the information truly public or to people who need to know, that balance needs to be struck."
Dale Fisher, a Singapore-based physician and chair of the World Health Organization's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, said the best way to curb the spread of the epidemic might be different in each country.
"It's all contextual. In Korea it might be acceptable, in California that might cause an outrage," he said. "Community engagement is so critical in this response, the community needs to be part of the solution when you've got a community-spread epidemic like this."
In South Korea, the woman known as Patient No. 31, suspected of being a super-spreader behind a massive surge in cases in the country's southeast, has become a point of intense public interest, scrutiny and criticism. She was vilified online after reports that she had refused to be tested despite showing symptoms. Many questioned whether she could be criminally prosecuted. Fake photos, identifying details and rumors about the woman rapidly circulated on social media.
"No. 31 on her own wiped out Daegu," one exasperated user wrote on Twitter. "Daegu is going down because of that No. 31 patient," another said.
The woman has given interviews to several local news outlets saying that although she wasn't given detailed instructions, she sought out testing for the virus.
"We don't want to put a stigma on these people," said Ian Mackay, a virologist and associate professor at Australia's University of Queensland. "People won't come forward if they think they're going to be held to blame for an infection they didn't intend to get or want to get."
Much of the public outrage over the sharp increase in cases has been centered on the Shincheonji church that Patient No. 31 attended. A religious sect with 12 branches around the country, the church has been described as a "cult" for its messianic leader. It has been criticized for reportedly infiltrating other churches and its domineering hold on its members.
Even a public health official in charge of infection prevention in Seo-gu in Daegu was revealed to be a member of the church after he was diagnosed with the virus. Many members hide their affiliation with the controversial church.
More than 750,000 signed a petition to the South Korean president urging that the church be disbanded. Authorities in Gyeonggi province raided the group's headquarters in the city of Gwacheon, alleging that the church had been slow to turn over its list of members. South Korean officials said they would track down and test all 245,000 members of the church.
Katherine Gibney, an infectious diseases specialist and epidemiologist at Austin Hospital near Melbourne, Australia, said as the virus continues to spread globally, each government will determine how best to prepare its citizens for a potential outbreak without infringing on individual rights or heightening panic.
"It's really important to get risk communication right. That's a challenge with every outbreak, especially with a novel virus," she said. "It's important to balance when it's potentially useful for someone to know, versus when it might just cause panic and without much actual risk of contracting it."

Desperate to stanch anxieties on Wall Street and public fears that the White House is unprepared for a major coronavirus outbreak, President Trump on Wednesday named Vice President Mike Pence to coordinate the administration's response while asserting that "the risk to the American people remains very low."
Public health officials who flanked Trump at a rare news conference in the White House briefing room were noticeably less upbeat, repeatedly warning of the risk that the deadly COVID-19 virus -- which has infected 60 Americans, including a newly confirmed case Wednesday in California -- could still spread quickly in the United States.
"The trajectory we're looking at in coming weeks and months is very uncertain," said Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"We can expect to see more cases in the United States," said Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services.
Minutes after Trump spoke, the CDC confirmed a new case of the virus in California in a person who reported no travel to an affected country or exposure to another known patient. The CDC did not say where the person lived, but said the case could be the first so-called community transmission of the disease in the United States.
Officials urged Americans to take basic precautions, such as washing hands and staying home if sick. And Trump acknowledged that the administration has plans for "large scale" quarantines should they be needed.
"Whatever happens, we're totally prepared," he said, but later suggested schools, hospitals and other facilities needed to take their own precautions.
"I think schools should be preparing just in case" of a major outbreak, he said. "Every aspect of our society should be prepared," he added. "I don't think it's going to come to that."
Trump, who has downplayed the coronavirus threat for weeks, sought to reassure Americans and to calm stock markets, which have plunged more than 6.5% in the last three days on fears of the disease.
"I think the stock market will recover," Trump said, although he later conceded that the disease "will have an impact" on the nation's gross domestic product.
Trump did not rule out possibly barring visitors from South Korea, Italy and other countries with confirmed outbreaks. The U.S. already has stopped accepting visitors from China, where the epidemic has spread widely.
All told, more than 80,000 people in some three dozen countries are known to be infected. More than 2,700 have died.
Trump blamed Democrats and the media for stoking public fear, accusing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of "trying to create a panic," even as his administration faces bipartisan concern over its disjointed response.
The fast-spreading COVID-19 virus appears on track to test the competency of an administration that has proposed large budget cuts to the CDC, shut down an office assigned to track deadly diseases around the world and is rocked by constant turnover in top positions responsible for handling emergencies and potential emergencies.
Trump, who has claimed credit for the rising stock market of the last three years, has been preoccupied with its abrupt drop, complaining to business leaders during his trip to India this week that the stomach-churning fall-off was beyond his control.
CDC officials warned Tuesday that it's virtually certain the coronavirus outbreak will spread to pockets in the U.S. and that Americans should brace for major disruptions to everyday life, possibly including restricted travel, closed schools and work slowdowns.
Allies counseled Trump to put his political and economic frustrations aside to focus on the public health threat, arguing that ancillary problems will fix themselves once the public is convinced the administration is prepared for what may prove a significant crisis.
"This is not a garden-variety routine event," said Ari Fleischer, former press secretary for President George W. Bush, who saw his popularity plummet after a botched response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. "This can grow into people being legitimately scared into wondering what to do to protect their health, to protect their family's health."
Fleischer was among many experts and former officials jarred by the administration's sluggish reaction so far and conflicting messages from the White House, which says the situation is under control, and federal health officials, who have issued increasingly dire warnings.
"A situation like this is extremely volatile and dynamic," said Dr. Irwin Redlener, who heads the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. "And to have all these mixed messages from the administration is mind-boggling. It seems they are so muddled at the White House about the political and economic consequences of this that they've resorted to just making stuff up."
He warned that until the government issues clear guidance, state and local health officials are unable to make plans for a potential public health emergency.
Tom Ridge, who served as the nation's first Homeland Security secretary under Bush and co-chairs a bipartisan commission on biodefense, faulted Trump for his breezy response to the threat and Democrats for what he called their "sky is falling" complaints.
"I just don't recall when public health issues have ever been politicized like they are now," Ridge said. "It is a real crisis" worldwide.
Underscoring the political risks for the president, new polling shows substantial public anxiety about the risk of an epidemic.
More than half of Americans expressed concern that there will be a widespread U.S. outbreak of coronavirus, according to a survey by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, which was conducted Feb. 13-18, before the recent stock market declines.
More than 4 in 10 said they were concerned they or someone in their family will get sick from the virus.
"People don't do well with the unknown," said Craig Fugate, who led emergency response efforts for President Obama. "Tell them what you know. Tell them what you don't know," he advised.
In November, a task force at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies, which included five current and former GOP senators and House members, warned of gaping holes in the country's defenses against a major health crisis. "The American people are far from safe," the report concluded. "To the contrary, the United States remains woefully ill-prepared to respond to global health security threats."
It recommended the reinstatement of a National Security Council official to coordinate pandemic response, and renewed funding and attention to global health problems
Earlier Wednesday, Azar testified on Capitol Hill for the second day and defended the administration's response so far, saying he was overseeing "the smoothest interagency process I've experienced in my 20 years of dealing with public health emergencies."
But other officials told Congress that they lack basic supplies such as respiratory masks and functioning testing kits. Only about a dozen state and local laboratories can run tests outside of the CDC in Atlanta because the kits it sent out nationwide this month included a faulty component.
Democrats warned that the administration's response is insufficient -- citing prior cuts to the CDC -- and that its request to Congress for $2.5 billion in special funding doesn't address the scope of the problem.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said Trump has "not done nearly enough" and said California communities are responding to the virus "despite poor coordination and vague guidance from the federal government."
Republicans suggested that Democrats were too eager to criticize the administration. No sooner did the White House release the funding request "than some politicians were on the air criticizing you for not asking for enough," said Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.).

BUSINESS BEAT; Hong Kong plans $1,284 handout amid unrest, virus

Hong Kong's government unveiled a budget packed with giveaways including a one-time cash handout that economists said isn't likely to spur growth, as the city struggles to stabilize an economy battered by political unrest and the coronavirus.
The main feature of the annual budget announced Wednesday is a payment of the U.S. equivalent of $1,284 to each permanent resident of the city age 18 or older, aiding a population "overwhelmed by a heavy atmosphere," Financial Secretary Paul Chan said. Chan estimated the deficit will reach a record $17.9 billion in the coming fiscal year.
The administration of Chief Executive Carrie Lam is seeking to stop the slide of the collapsing economy, rolling out the boldest budget in recent years amid blame for government inertia.
Months of political unrest over China's role in the city pushed Hong Kong last year into its first annual recession in a decade, with economists forecasting a second annual contraction in 2020 as disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak further depress output.
"In these unprecedented times, I am confident that the 2020-21 budget proposals will provide effective and targeted support to help the Hong Kong community withstand the current difficulties and gear up for a brighter tomorrow," Lam said in a statement welcoming the spending plans.
However, the handout immediately faced criticism from economists.
"This is obviously untargeted and regressive and will not solve the problem of those most severely hit," said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis. "It is like throwing a drop in the ocean for many while you could have used that amount to cure the injuries of only a few."
Ahead of the budget, accounting firm KPMG pushed for handouts in the form of electronic vouchers to encourage direct spending, rather than saving or moving the cash abroad.
Kevin Lai, chief economist for Asia excluding Japan at Daiwa Capital Markets, is skeptical as to whether Hong Kong residents will rush to spend a cash windfall.
"That sounds like a lot, but would you go out and spend it? The answer is no," he said. "The economic benefits will only be marginal. Shops and restaurants are screaming for business. It's not going to help."
The handout is not the first in Hong Kong. The government distributed the current equivalent of $770 to all permanent residents in 2011. In 2018, the government introduced a program to hand out as much as $513 to some low-income residents.
Singapore also announced cash handouts in its budget last week, pledging a one-time payout of between $71.52 and $215 for Singaporeans ages 21 and older, as part of a $1.2-billion package to help households.

BUSINESS BEAT; Virus a 'challenge' for Apple; CEO Cook acknowledges issues posed by closures due to the outbreak

Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook called the coronavirus outbreak a "challenge" for the iPhone maker during a pep talk for shareholders at the company's annual meeting.
The effects of the virus, which have closed factories and stores throughout China, pose significant issues for the technology giant. Apple produces hundreds of millions of devices each year in China. This month, the company said it wouldn't meet its revenue forecast of more than $63 billion for the current quarter, citing iPhone supply constraints and lost retail sales in China.
Apple has since reopened about 30 of its 42 stores in China. Suppliers and mass assembly partners are also slowly coming back up to speed, but some analysts have said the fallout could spill into the quarter that ends in June.
In prepared remarks Wednesday at Apple's shareholder meeting in Cupertino, Calif., Cook said annual revenue from wearables such as AirPods and Apple Watches compares with that of Marriott International Inc. plus Visa Inc. -- more than $40 billion. Apple reported $10 billion in fiscal first-quarter revenue for its wearables, home and accessories unit.
Answering questions from the audience, Cook said that for the first time Apple would open its online store in India this year, with the first retail stores opening in the country in 2021.
He also made his first public comments about the company's rejection of the U.S. government's request to unlock iPhones belonging to the shooter behind the December 2019 attack that killed three people in Pensacola, Fla.
"Don't think we have something that we're not giving," he said, adding that Apple wouldn't create a back door to break into its devices.
A proposal that would have held Apple more accountable for the information it gives to the Chinese government narrowly failed.
The shareholder proposal would have required Apple to disclose its policies on freedom of expression and access to information, as well as provide details on the actions Apple has taken in the last year to respond to government requests that limit free expression. The measure garnered significant support, with 59.4% of shareholders voting against it and 40.6% voting for it.
On a much lighter note, Cook was asked why the company didn't acquire the rights to the show "Friends" for its Apple TV+ streaming service. The CEO said the company is focused on developing original shows rather than buying old offerings.
Cook's comments at shareholder meetings sometimes hint at future products. At the 2019 meeting, Cook said there was a "long, great road map of fantastic" AirPods ahead. New AirPods launched just weeks later, followed by the AirPods Pro in October.
The top Apple executive didn't specify any future products, but the company is working on new iPhones with 5G for later this year, Bloomberg News has reported. It's also planning to launch a virtual reality headset as early as 2021. It's unclear whether those plans may be affected by the coronavirus outbreak.
Shareholders reelected Apple's board, which includes Cook and former Vice President Al Gore.

Colleges tell students in Italy, S. Korea to return

Some U.S. universities are ordering students to leave Italy, one of the most popular study-abroad destinations, and discouraging travel to South Korea as the novel coronavirus spreads.
With a rapidly evolving outbreak, university officials accustomed to planning months ahead have had to move quickly to protect students, faculty and staff on campuses that have become increasingly global.
The uncertainty affects thousands of students: More than 340,000 students from the United States studied overseas in the 2017-2018 academic year, according to the Institute of International Education's Open Doors survey.
Many programs in China were suspended last month amid the outbreak. But the arrival of coronavirus in Italy and elsewhere in Europe took the disruption to another level.
American students overwhelmingly choose Western Europe for study abroad, said Brad Farnsworth, vice president for global engagement at the American Council on Education, a higher education group. 'When you talk about the cancellation of programs in Europe, the scale is so much greater,' he said.
Italy is a leading destination, with nearly 37,000 students from U.S. schools enrolled in programs there in the 2017-2018 academic year. Only the United Kingdom drew more students from the United States.
Florida International University canceled spring study-abroad programs in Italy, Singapore, Japan and South Korea on Tuesday and directed people in those countries on university-related business to return to the United States immediately.
Stanford University suspended its study program in Florence, with in-person instruction ending Wednesday, and plans to begin digital coursework from the United States in March. The university has not made a decision about the spring quarter. The decision to have students come home early was made largely to avoid possible travel restrictions, a university spokesman said.
New York University's president echoed that concern in a message to campus announcing suspension of operations at its Florence campus Thursday. The 300 students taking classes there will return home and take online classes until at least late March.
NYU spokesman John Beckman said a sharp uptick in cases and the speed with which Italian authorities decided to quarantine towns spurred the decision.
University officials are hoping to minimize complications for students upon their return. One student went home to Israel, said Josh Taylor, associate vice chancellor for global programs and mobility services at NYU. That student must remain in isolation for 14 days.
NYU officials will reassess the situation in several weeks and determine if students can return to Italy, Taylor said.
More than 300 Syracuse University students studying in Florence are also receiving help with returning home, the school said.
The considerations for school officials are complex, said Frederick M. Lawrence, secretary and chief executive of the Phi Beta Kappa Society and a member of the Georgetown Law faculty.
'You don't want to overreact, you don't want to panic, but you don't want to be on the back end,' either, Lawrence said, waiting to take action and then finding it's difficult or impossible to get students home because flights have been canceled.
Once students return, another problem emerges, said Lawrence, who is also a former president of Brandeis University: 'What do you do with them?' Many schools have limited housing, he said, so finding places for students to stay may be difficult. Academically, the questions are complicated as well. Halting studies isn't ideal, but neither is quickly forcing classes into a digital format. The experience of living and studying abroad 'cannot remotely be replicated in an online platform,' he said. There will be lost revenue, in many cases.
South Korea and Italy have the most confirmed cases of infection outside China, where the virus was first reported.
On Wednesday, Janet Napolitano, president of the University of California, issued a directive to the UC system to avoid nonessential travel to South Korea, and to return if already there.
The University of Wisconsin at Madison suspended study-abroad programs in South Korea on Wednesday, as did American University.
Most universities responded quickly to the threat in China " even, in the case of Duke Kunshan University and NYU Shanghai, re-creating the curriculum online in just weeks.
But as the situation continues to change and infections spread, school officials have faced continuing uncertainty.
'There's no question that this is significant and it will have various kinds of ripple effects not just over the next week but probably over the next several months,' said Michael Schoenfeld, a spokesman for Duke University, where students who had been studying in Italy were on their way back to the United States on Wednesday.

China's 'choke hold' on drug supply fuels fears of U.S. disruptions, shortages

The Food and Drug Administration is stepping up its monitoring of the drug supply for potential shortages, including 20-products that may be at risk due to the coronavirus outbreak that has shut down much of China and is raising concerns about the nation's convoluted and highly outsourced pharmaceutical supply chain.
The crisis highlights a growing vulnerability: Not only are many medications used in the United States manufactured overseas, but critical ingredients " and the chemicals used to make them " also are overwhelmingly made in China and other countries. The supply chain's roots now run so deep that it is difficult to fully anticipate where critical shortages could emerge.
Rosemary Gibson, co-author of the book 'China Rx: Exposing the Risks of America's Dependence on China for Medicine' and a senior adviser at the Hastings Center, a bioethics think tank, said China has a 'global choke hold' on the chemical components that make up key ingredients.
'In the age of a few clicks in a keyboard and items get delivered, we overlook where products come from and the components to make them,' she said. 'We are dependent on others, and they will keep medicines for their own people.'
Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the energy and commerce subcommittee on health, has similar concerns. 'The red lights are blinking,' she said. 'It's one thing for China to make athletic wear for us, but to depend on them for our drug supply? That's not acceptable.'
The FDA said that no companies are reporting drug shortages linked to the coronavirus. But in a sign of its efforts to get ahead of any problems, an FDA spokeswoman said the agency has contacted 180 China-based prescription-drug manufacturers asking them to evaluate their supply chains and remind them that they are required to notify the FDA of any coming disruptions. Many U.S. drug companies buy Chinese-made active pharmaceutical ingredients, called APIs, in bulk, insulating themselves against a supply disruption for weeks, months or even a year.
The 20 products the agency is watching especially closely use raw materials that all come from China, the FDA said.
With the course of the outbreak unpredictable, and information scarce on when Chinese factories will resume normal operations, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn warned that 'the outbreak will likely impact the medical product supply chain, including potential disruptions to supply or shortages of critical medical products' in the United States.
The drug supply chain is opaque and complex " for the most part, consumers and even hospitals cannot find where their drugs or the ingredients that go into them are made. Even the FDA has acknowledged that it does not know the amount of drug ingredients being shipped from China.
'We cannot determine with any precision the volume of API that China is actually producing, or the volume . . . entering the U.S. market,' Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, told Congress last fall.
The agency does track where factories are and reported last year that about 14 percent of the facilities that make active pharmaceutical ingredients are in China.
The number of factories situated in China has risen sharply in recent years as a result of low-cost labor, less stringent environmental regulations and the need for large factory sites, Woodcock told Congress.
Eshoo and others lament that there isn't enough publicly available information on the complicated supply chain for drugs. Much of the information is proprietary and closely held by drug companies and regulators.
Former FDA chief Scott Gott lieb, at a recent hearing about U.S. preparedness for pandemics, warned not only about U.S. reliance on the active ingredients in drugs, but also on their chemical precursors " 'lower margin, low-technology starting materials and components that " over time " have become sole sourced in China.' Many of these materials are made in China's Hubei province, the epicenter of coronavirus, he said.
'We may not even be aware of the full scope of these vulnerabilities,' he added. 'In many cases, we don't have established systems for tracking down to the level of these components.'
There are 44 pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in Hubei that are approved by the FDA or its European counterpart to make products for the highly regulated U.S. and European Union markets, according to Fiona Barry, an associate editor at PharmSource, a product of the data and analytics company GlobalData.
Of these, 35 produce active pharmaceutical ingredients, five make finished-dose drugs and four manufacture both.
Some lawmakers are focused on getting more information on potential shortages. Legislation introduced by Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Tina Smith (D-Minn.) would require drugmakers to report looming shortages of pharmaceutical ingredients, not just finished products.
'The FDA needs greater visibility into the drug supply chain so that they can better assess risks and potential disruptions,' Collins said in a statement.
If the threat from coronavirus subsides quickly, there may be minimal effects on the pharmaceutical supply chain. But those are likely to vary by company. Some may have up to a year's extra supply on hand and multiple factories in multiple countries, while others may have less robust supply chains.
Novartis spokesperson Eric Althoff said that the company had taken steps to prevent shortages, including keeping a safety stockpile and sourcing ingredients from more than one supplier, and that it doesn't anticipate a supply chain disruption 'for the time being.'
Manjira Ghosh Sharma, a spokesperson for Lupin, an Indian generic-pharmaceutical company, said: 'Currently there are no shipments coming out of China, and the situation on ground is very dynamic. However, we are comfortably placed with eight to 10 weeks of key inventory in place.'
On an earnings call in early February, another Indian company, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, described the complexity of the supply chain.
Some raw materials come almost exclusively from China, said Dilip Shanghvi, the managing director of Sun, including antibiotics such as azithromycin, penicillin and cephalosporin. In a sign of how the supply chain can be hard to unravel, he noted that raw materials that were purchased in India might depend on ingredients sourced in China.
Some say the drug supply chain is too complicated and goes through too many countries. But Ronald Piervincenzi, chief executive of U.S. Pharmacopeia, a nonprofit organization that sets quality standards for drugs, said a diverse supply network is a bulwark against disruptions caused by civil unrest, outbreaks and natural disasters.
'In the event of Hurricane Irene,' he said, which affected much of the Caribbean and the East Coast in 2011, 'you wouldn't want all your drugs to be made in New Jersey.'
But it is a problem, he said, that such a big chunk of active ingredients is made in one country " China " and that it is so difficult for American health-care providers and consumers to know where their drugs, and their drugs' components, are made. If a hospital wants to know whether its supply of antibiotics is vulnerable, it needs to know where the drugs and the component parts are coming from, he said.
Currently, he said, 'there's no way to know where antibiotics come from, or where the ingredients come from.'

Worries of illness amid worship

Ash Wednesday is a chance for clergy to remind Christians of their mortality, often with a swipe of thumb-to-forehead ashes. But this year, the holy day came one day after federal health officials said the country should brace for an 'inevitable' spread of coronavirus.
Pastors and ministers who already were mulling whether to change practices at weekly church services and struggling to reassure nervous worshipers, especially in immigrant-heavy congregations, found themselves asking: Should we tweak our rituals?
'It's a very intimate moment,' said Teer Hardy, an associate pastor at Mount Olivet United Methodist Church in Arlington, which has about 350 people on an average Sunday. 'You're a couple of inches from someone's face.'
Pastors at his church planned to wash their hands and use hand sanitizer before administering ashes in the shape of a cross. The practice symbolizes penance and mortality, the idea that Christians are to 'repent and believe in the Gospel' as they 'remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.'
Hardy is among many pastors who are discussing possible scenarios for how to deal with the coronavirus, including if the church had to close over a potential spread.
The outbreak that began in China has since spread to other countries. In the Philippines, Catholic priests were urged to sprinkle ashes on parishioners instead of marking their foreheads through direct contact. In Italy, several churches closed for Ash Wednesday. In South Korea, a secretive megachurch that has been at the center of the virus's spread was shut down by authorities.
Spokespeople for many of the largest Christian denominations in the United States said this week that they have not issued special directives for their churches but are closely monitoring guidance from government officials. The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey told clergy and lay leaders Tuesday that anyone administering Communion should wash their hands, preferably with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and keep their distance during the greeting ritual known as the 'passing of the peace.'
'Parishioners who are coughing or sneezing should refrain from handshaking during the Peace,' the email from the diocese said. 'Fist bumps, elbow bumps, friendly waves, and peace signs are all acceptable substitutes.'
Houses of worship are one of the few places in American life where people of all ages and backgrounds intermingle on a regular basis. And many churches are on the front lines of assisting people who are sick, hosting clinics to provide flu shots or other health services and posting signs encouraging hand washing.
Mount Olivet, for example, has a nursery and preschool, where staff ask parents not to bring in children who have had fevers within the past 24 hours. On the third Sunday of every month, the church welcomes about 300 people for health screenings and donations of food and clothing.
'What does it mean to sit in the pew with people coming off the streets or folks who need a stopgap?' Hardy said. 'The decision is we'll follow the CDC and other health organizations. We're trained clergy, not health professionals. We don't want to spread unnecessary concern and panic.'
The issue is causing tensions in some places. One pastor at a predominantly white church in the Midwest, who asked that his church not be identified because it could damage relationships, said tensions flared among the Chinese members when a South Korean family did not quarantine themselves after returning from a trip to South Korea.
'Our doors are open, especially for the immigrant community,' the pastor said. 'We're not going to operate by fear.'
Churches offer a range of experiences when it comes to interactions between parishioners. In some, parishioners can experience a touch-free service, receiving individually prepackaged Communion and paying tithes digitally. In others, they exchange kisses during the 'passing of the peace,' place cash in a basket and shake hands during 'coffee hour.'
Many denominations teach that Communion is the real body of Jesus; others say it represents Jesus. Benjamin Hopkins, who attends Redeemer Episcopal Church in Shelby, N. C., said his priest made an announcement about the most sanitary way to take Communion during the service about a month ago, noting the flu season. The priest recommended drinking from a common cup for Communion, which would be wiped down after each person, instead of having each person dip their wafer into the wine.
The dipping practice, known as 'intinction,' puts 'dirty hands into close proximity to the wine and cup and is actually less hygienic than simply sharing a silver cup that is wiped after each person and that is filled with fortified port wine,' said Hopkins, a farmer who has been a lay Eucharistic minister. 'There were skeptics, but most people have gone to drinking rather than intinction since then.'
Some churches already have plans in place for what to do in a flu epidemic, such as putting hymnals and collection baskets out of reach for a period, emptying holy-water fonts and serving just bread during Communion rather than both bread and wine from a common cup. During the 2009 H1N1 'swine flu' spread, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to faith-based organizations, urging them to adjust Communion practices, provide tissues, reduce crowding and remind people to wash their hands and maintain distance during any greeting.
During the H1N1 scare, Jamie Aten was living in southern Mississippi, where local health officials explicitly told religious leaders not to extend Communion.
'As you can imagine, that did not go over well,' said Aten, who is now executive director of the Humanitarian Disaster Institute at Wheaton College in Illinois. 'It created a bit of mistrust between health-care professionals and religious leaders.'
He said he recommends that pastors and ministers have some kind of plan in place, based on guidance from public health officials, without stoking fear among worshipers.
'Anybody can do a live Facebook sermon, should it get to that point,' he said. 'That's a little more panicked than we need at this moment, but we still want to be prepared.'

Outbreak in Iran poses risks elsewhere

ISTANBUL " Iran is emerging as the center of an outbreak of the new coronavirus across the Middle East, where cases in at least five countries have been linked to patients who traveled to Iran in recent weeks, authorities said. 
In Iran, 139 people have contracted the virus, including the deputy health minister and a prominent member of parliament. Nineteen people have died, according to the Health Ministry " the largest death toll from the virus outside China, where it first appeared.
The government has struggled to contain the spread of infections after reporting the first confirmed cases in the holy Shiite city of Qom last week. Since then, the virus has appeared in multiple Iranian cities, and infections in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon and Oman have been traced back to Iran. 
Several countries have halted flights to Iran. On Wednesday, Bahrain said the number of coronavirus infections in the island nation had risen to 26, after three more cases were detected among people who had recently returned from Iran, state media reported. 
In Iraq, which borders Iran, authorities closed crossings along the frontier, and medical teams at the country's airports monitored arriving passengers after five people were confirmed to have been infected. Hundreds of thousands of Iranians visit Iraq's holy city of Najaf each year, and shrines and schools there were shuttered Wednesday and the streets largely empty, residents said. 
But even as regional governments moved to control the outbreak, Iranian authorities came under fire for what critics said is an inadequate response to the threat. Officials have rejected calls to quarantine major cities and have allowed communal prayer services to continue in places such as Qom, where the virus first emerged in Iran. Nurses and other medical personnel have complained in interviews and on social media that authorities were preventing health workers from wearing masks and were forcing staff to buy their own gloves. 
'The equipment we have and the protective measures in place are all very primitive. The situation is critical,' said one nurse at the Shariati teaching hospital in Tehran. She was reached by telephone and spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss her working conditions. 
The hospital, she said, lacks coronavirus testing kits and was attempting to diagnose patients through their symptoms and chest X-rays. 
The virus, officially called SARS-CoV-2, causes fever, cough and mild to severe respiratory illness. But some relatives of patients who died of the disease, named covid-19, as well as nurses in other hospitals, said few people exposed to the virus were being screened or tested, according to posts on social media. One man who spoke to Radio Farda, a U.S.-funded Persian-language broadcast service, said he was forced to bury his 83-year-old mother after she died of covid-19 in Qom. 
Despite the growing concerns, President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday urged fellow Iranians to 'continue work and other activities.' He said 'enemy plots' were to blame for 'spreading fear and closing down the country.' 
Rouhani made the remarks on the same day that his deputy health minister " and head of Iran's task force against the coronavirus " was diagnosed with the virus. On Monday, Iraj Harirchi was shown coughing and sweating profusely as he briefed reporters on the outbreak in a government building in Tehran. 
'With regard to quarantines, we are absolutely against them. . . . [They] belong to the pre-World War era, for the plague, cholera, stuff like that,' Harirchi said, wiping his brow and taking sips of water. 
The next day, Harirchi posted a video online announcing that he has the virus. Another prominent official, reformist lawmaker Mahmoud Sadeghi, also said he tested positive for the virus that causes covid-19. 
'The government appears unable to grasp the scope or severity of the coronavirus outbreak. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and Rouhani are probably unwilling to take decisive steps that could unsettle a population already under extreme pressure from U.S. sanctions,' said Henry Rome, an Iran analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. 
'But this political decision has undermined containment efforts, such as outbreak surveillance, travel restrictions or quarantines,' he said. 'Government inaction could set the stage for a broader outbreak in the country, increasing the risk to other Middle Eastern countries.' 
In Iraq, for example, the Interior Ministry said that more than 8,000 Iraqis have returned from Iran in recent weeks and that it would be adopting measures to test and quarantine them. It was unclear, however, how or when earlier arrivals would be traced or monitored. 
Doctors said Iraq's dilapidated health-care system would be ill-equipped to cope with a significant outbreak. Suspected cases were put under quarantine in Najaf, in the south, and in the northern cities of Mosul and Kirkuk.
'Those who have symptoms are put in isolation. Those who don't are sent home with instructions about how to quarantine themselves,' said Rana Fakhry, a doctor working at the airport in Najaf, where Iraq's first coronavirus case was reported.
'At this airport alone, there are five flights a day from Iran, 200 Iraqis on each,' she said. 'We're checking everyone.'
The Health Ministry said it has established hotlines in each Iraqi province so that residents can report symptoms or concerns. In the capital, Baghdad, the number appeared to be out of service, and in other provinces, the doctors who answered said they were fielding hundreds of calls.
'Our system is not modern. We don't have proper space for quarantine or proper antibacterial measures to keep things clean,' said Yasser Maki, a dentist at a hospital in Najaf. 'We're not ready. We're not ready at all.'

Dow's drop Wednesday pushes five-day decline to more than 8 percent
Wall Street's anxieties about the coronavirus were on full display Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average moving from a three-digit morning surge to a 124-point loss at the end of the day. The outbreak's rapid spread in Italy, Iran and South Korea has investors worried that the worst is still to come.
Wednesday brings the Dow's five-day losing streak to 2,390 points, erasing 8.15 percent off the blue chip gauge. It's the biggest five-day percentage loss in two years.
'This is the pullback that everybody says was long overdue and that will shake out some of the weak hands,' said Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer at Tigress Financial Partners. 'It's all coronavirus. Every time the market starts to rally, another case pops up.'
New cases outside China exceeded those within its borders for the first time Wednesday, the World Health Organization reported. Investors are increasingly waking up to the potential fallout from an outbreak that has claimed nearly 3,000 lives, upended global supply chains, dramatically slowed travel and taken a bite out of corporate earnings. Oxford Economics says the virus could slow global growth to its lowest levels since the financial crisis.
Wall Street's demeanor darkened significantly Tuesday after officials from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that the virus would inevitably take a toll on the United States and asked businesses and local communities to prepare for its impact. The Dow on Tuesday endured its worst two-day slump in four years, with the blue-chip index chalking up back-to-back 3 percent declines.
Wednesday saw an early rebound, with the Dow advancing more than 400 points before turning negative. The reversal came after Germany announced that it was on the brink of an epidemic and Bloomberg News reported that a Food and Drug Administration official said the virus was on the 'cusp of a pandemic.'
'Today's 652-point swing in the Dow shows that there are buyers out there, but more investors are waiting on the sidelines, looking for better bargains,' said Howard Silverblatt of S-P Dow Jones Indices.
'No one knows for sure how much further this decline may have to run, but excesses have quickly been wrung out,' said Sam Stovall of CFRA Research.
The Standard - Poor's 500-stock index on Wednesday dropped 12 points to 3,116. The broad S-P has lost 7.97 percent in the past five sessions. That is also the biggest loss in two years. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite broke a losing streak by finishing up 15 points to close at 8,980.
'The recent market carnage saw the S-P 500 futures fall 9-percent from the record high, and investors are nervous we could see further short-term weakness as history suggests outbreaks could take several months before the longer-term bullish trend reasserts itself,' Ed Moya, an analyst with OANDA, wrote in commentary Wednesday. 'Until the global spreading of the virus appears under control, we could see continued downward revisions to growth forecasts.'
Overseas, investors shared Wall Street's jitters. Europe's benchmark Stoxx 600 index closed nearly flat, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed down 0.7 percent and Japan's Nikkei 225 closed down nearly 0.8-percent.
Oil prices continued to fall, a reflection of the lower demand across the globe brought on in part by the coronavirus's shackling Asian economies. The U.S. oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate sank deeper below the $50 per barrel 'make or break threshold,' trading at $48.71 late in the day. That's the lowest price for WTI in a year. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell to $52.75 per barrel.
Bond yields skirted near all-time lows. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rebounded slightly from Tuesday's all-time low. Yield drops as the price of a bond rises.
White House officials are playing down the threat posed by the outbreak. Larry Kudlow, President Trump's chief economic adviser, said late Monday that investors should consider 'buying these dips.' On CNBC earlier this week, Kudlow said he did not expect the Federal Reserve to react to the coronavirus and cut interest rates to juice the economy. He said there is 'no supply disruption' appearing in the numbers that the White House is studying.
'We have contained this. We have contained this. I won't say airtight, but pretty close to airtight,' Kudlow told CNBC in an interview Tuesday.
The outbreak has hobbled China's powerful manufacturing sector, causing major supply-chain disruptions that have dampened revenue forecasts in a variety of industries. Retailers including Nike and Starbucks have closed stores in China, while the giants Apple and Tesla have warned of the virus's impact on their profitability. As scores of airlines reduce service, air travel demand is slated to decline this year for the first time since the financial crisis, with the virus costing the airline industry $29.3 billion, the International Air Transport Association warned this week. China's idled factories and shut-in consumers have delivered a tough blow to the auto industry, which is expected to experience a 2.5-percent decline in 2020 global auto sales, according to a new report from Moody's.

Empty flights, canceled tours: Italy's pain may spread in Europe

MILAN " On the wall outside Jamaica, a century-old bar-bistro and a Milan institution, a newly hung sign points to the frustration that has accompanied the arrival of coronavirus in northern Italy.
'Jamaica did not close under the bombardments, must it close for collective hysteria?' it reads, referring to the cafe's perseverance through the bombings of World War II. 
Restrictions imposed to control the virus " and public panic " have transformed Italy's commercial and financial capital in a way some Milanese fear will result in a deep and lasting economic blow.
Trams rattle by half-empty. Office buildings are vacant. Top-flight soccer matches are played in empty stadiums behind closed doors.
Walking through areas normally buzzing with nightlife, 'it's like a bomb exploded,' said Carlina Cretella, whose family has run Jamaica since 1911. 
'You can feel it in your body,' she said. 
As more cases of coronavirus are reported across Europe and U.S. health officials warn of an inevitably wider spread, the concern that has gripped northern Italy is extending its hold. And what Italy is seeing as far as the effects on daily life and the economy may play out elsewhere, too.
Italy's containment measures are less drastic than China's " and easier for other democracies to replicate. And so economists say it is likely that other countries will respond much as Italy has, with precautionary measures prompting factories to close, travelers to cancel plans, stores to shutter and people to hunker down. 
It is too early to know how successful such measures will be in limiting the spread. In the city of Milan, which has recorded one confirmed case, some of the precautions are self-imposed. Farther afield in the surrounding region, where the outbreak first broke into view, the Italian government has closed off nearly a dozen small towns, paralyzing economic life with no end in sight.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte this week said the economic blow to Italy could be 'very strong.'
Meanwhile, the rest of the continent " which even before was worried about slowing growth, global trade wars and the continued uncertainty of Brexit " is bracing itself.
'If the virus spreads, and it will spread, I think any local or national politician would have to take very drastic action, and that will virtually halt the economy,' said Roberto Perotti, an economist at Milan's Bocconi University, who was working from home this week. 'For how long, we don't know. Can you imagine a [car] factory if there is one case in the factory? Can you imagine it not shutting down? I doubt it.'
For Italy, the coronavirus could hardly have broken out in a more damaging economic area. The country's two largest northern regions, Lombardy and Veneto, account for 30 percent of the employment and 40 percent of the exports. Milan is the economic hub, and to the east, Venice is a tourism mega-draw for a country that depends on visitors for 13 percent of its gross domestic product. While the country's north is prosperous, it powers an otherwise stagnant country " one with no growth in 20 years, and now all but assured of its fourth recession since 2008.
Italy had Europe's weakest economic growth in 2019. The European Union predicted the same for 2020 " before the coronavirus arrived from China.
While traders have talked about potential supply chain interruptions, for now the economic pain is most visible on the granular level. Flights arrive to Milan with just a smattering of passengers, including one this week from Paris with 30 people spread out over more than 150 seats. Venetian tour guides and resort town hoteliers speak about rafts of cancellations.
Wine producer Marco Calaon lives in the sealed-off town of Vò, in a wine region where activity has come to a 'standstill.' 
'There's about a hundred companies here who cannot keep on bottling as planned,' he said.
Among the few businesses doing brisk trade are pharmacies, which can't keep pace with demand for masks and hand sanitizer and are inundated with calls.
As the number of cases in Italy jumped this week, with 400 cases confirmed and 12 deaths, Italians were coming to terms with feeling shunned.
'It's an unpleasant feeling that we are the ones that nobody wants,' said Salvatore Lamonaca, 60, as he worked at a tobacco counter in a cafe near the Borsa Italiana stock exchange. 'That we are the infected people.' The cafe typically serves at least 50 lunches a day on its six small tables. It served just three lunches Tuesday.
'They are killing us with the closures,' said barista Viola Varchetta, 25. 'The economy was already bad, but now you really feel it. There's no need for me to even be here.' 
Some people she knows had canceled travel plans to other parts of Italy, she said. Health authorities have urged calm.
'The panic is spreading in Italy at a much higher level than the reality of the risk,' said Maria Rita Gismondo, a virologist at Luigi Sacco University Hospital in Milan. She pointed out that those that have died have been elderly and had chronic health conditions.
Milan's mayor, Giuseppe Sala, said it was important that the city does not grind to a halt. 
'We must not spread the virus of mistrust,' he said. 'It's not easy right now to attract visitors from all over the world, but I ask everyone to play his role.' 
But doing that probably will be an uphill battle. The city announced the cancellation of a furniture design fair on Tuesday. The famed Milan Fashion Week came to a panicked end, with Giorgio Armani holding its show in an empty theater, the event streamed online for safety reasons. 
Between 50 and 80 percent of the hotel reservations that were on the books on Friday had been canceled by Wednesday, said Maurizio Naro, the president of Milan's hotel association. 'It's really bad and it's worsening every day,' he said, blaming 'sensationalism' in the media and a lack of clear communication of the risks. 'Maybe we can resist if this lasts a couple of weeks, but if it goes on longer, I see deep black,' he said. 
Panicking tourists were canceling trips as far ahead on the calendar as June and July, he said. He urged people to wait and see whether things clear up. If the virus spreads, it may not be any different traveling to Milan than Paris or anywhere else, he said. 
'This is poisoning our lives.'

Treasury Yields Hit Fresh Record Lows; Energy Bonds Slide; Government-bond rally lifts most investment-grade corporate debt

U.S. government-bond yields, reversing Wednesday's early rise, were dragged down to fresh all-time lows amid new signs that the coronavirus is spreading.
Investors initially paused in buying Treasurys mostly because yields, which fall as bond prices rise, dropped to record lows Tuesday, traders and analysts said. Demand rose again following reports of new coronavirus cases in places including South America.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury closed Wednesday at 1.310%, down from Tuesday's then-record-low close of 1.328%. The 30-year bond's yield fell to 1.796% from 1.803% Tuesday.
The record-low yields in Treasurys suggest investors see a relatively high chance that the U.S. Federal Reserve could cut interest rates soon, but so far economic indicators don't bear that up, said Thomas Simmons, an economist at Jefferies LLC.
Economic fallout from the virus isn't likely to have a material impact on the U.S. economy until the second quarter of the year, and it will take more time for that data to be disseminated, Mr. Simmons said. Fed officials next meet to consider changing interest rates in mid-March.
"The 10-year broke through a record-low yield yesterday, and it's hard to see the market going much further absent more bad news," he said.
Bonds of energy companies weakened Wednesday as investors braced for more bad news from oil and gas producers.
Chesapeake Energy Corp.'s bond due 2025 fell to 66.75 cents Wednesday after the company reported a decline in revenue, down from 72.25 Tuesday, according to data from BondTicker. Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s bond due 2049, one of the most actively traded corporate bonds in the U.S. on Wednesday, fell as low as 102.28 cents on the dollar from 105.60 on Tuesday. The company is slated to report earnings this week.
More broadly, rising prices of Treasurys have boosted investment-grade corporate bonds, which typically move in lockstep with the government debt. Investment-grade corporate bonds returned 3.6% this year through Tuesday, compared with a 4% gain in U.S. government bonds and a roughly 3% loss in U.S. stocks, according to research from CreditSights.
The spread between yields of investment-grade bonds and Treasurys is likely to widen slightly, but investors "shouldn't be fussed about that," said Erin Lyons, a strategist at CreditSights. The yield differential of about 1.13 percentage points is larger than that of many other comparable bonds, giving the corporate debt good relative value, she said.
The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, rebounded Wednesday to 92.21 from 91.97 on Tuesday.

Macy's Inc. chief Jeff Gennette said the retailer was seeing a slight slowdown in sales as a result of the coronavirus due to fewer U.S. visits from Asian tourists, but it was too soon to know how significant an impact the disease would have on consumers or suppliers.
"We have about 70 stores that have a strong Asian customer base," Mr. Gennette said on a conference call Tuesday to discuss quarterly results. "We've seen some slowdown in sales in these stores this month. Nothing to be concerned about yet, but we believe that this is unfolding."
He said the department store operator, which makes less than 50% of its private-label goods in China, has also experienced a slowdown of products coming out of China. "Nothing concerning yet, and we're watching this one very, very carefully," Mr. Gennette said.
Macy's has reopened its Hong Kong offices and is working closely with its partners to manage production levels, finished goods and fabric supplies, Mr. Gennette said. He said planned U.S. tariffs last year on Chinese imports had helped prepare the company for supply chain disruptions. "We're watching this. It's an evolving situation."
Executives said they haven't factored any impact from the coronavirus into the company's targets for the current fiscal year, saying it was too soon to gauge. Some U.S. companies have warned disruptions at Chinese factories will likely hurt their results.
On Tuesday, Macy's said sales and profit declined in its latest quarter, but the retailer's overall financial results were in line with its postholiday estimates.
Earlier this month, the company said it planned to close 125 department stores over three years and cut about 2,000 jobs to combat lackluster growth and profits.
The company on Tuesday reported its profit fell about 55% to $340 million and revenue slipped to $8.34 billion for the quarter ended Feb. 1, compared with $8.46 billion a year earlier.

Federal health officials warned Tuesday that the new coronavirus will spread much more than it has in the U.S., and financial investors continued their repricing down of assets as a result. Equities fell another 3% or so. Politicians, meanwhile, were repricing upward their chances of another burst of new federal spending.
The Trump Administration on Monday sent Congress a request for $2.5 billion in spending to combat the virus that began in China. The government is now spending some $40 million to $50 million a month, so the request builds in the expectation of more U.S. cases than the 57 already diagnosed.
The White House is seeking up to $1.5 billion to develop and purchase a potential vaccine. Another quarter-billion dollars would go toward stockpiling protective gear, from masks to biohazard suits. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would get the rest to cover the costs of testing, repatriating and quarantining Americans who test positive with the disease.
Cue the inevitable gripes from Congress that this isn't nearly enough. Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the request "long overdue and completely inadequate." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the Administration's proposal to tap some of the money from an Ebola preparedness account an example of Mr. Trump's "towering incompetence." Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby, a Republican, worried that the White House was "lowballing" the emergency.
We'd take these complaints seriously if they were based on any expertise or factual understanding of the threat. Instead, they're ritualized gripes intended to set up the politics to make the bill a blowout and dare Mr. Trump to veto virus funds. The Schumer-Pelosi gambit is to load up the supplemental bill with other health spending, whether for state grants, federal research funds, or even aid for Puerto Rico's disaster survivors.
Mr. Schumer tossed out a $3.1 billion demand with little tangible basis, a tacit acknowledgment of the difficulty of spending on a potential pandemic of unknown severity. If the virus proves more serious or longer-lasting, Congress will have many chances to spend more.
This is the same game Congress played in 2014 when it ultimately appropriated $5.4 billion amid the Ebola panic. Most of that money went to fight Ebola abroad and develop a vaccine and drugs for treatment. Yet Democrats are now objecting to the White House plan to shift some $500 million of unused Ebola funds to fight the coronavirus. The Administration deserves credit for trying to reallocate that money to the more urgent threat.
Asking about this criticism while visiting New Delhi, Mr. Trump said that if he had requested more money Democrats would have said it was too much. He has a point, though our guess is that Democrats are preparing the ground to blame the Administration if the coronavirus spreads. The virus may well get worse, which is why the funding request anticipates more cases. Alas, there is no cure for cynicism in the service of pork-barrel politics.

Researchers have begun the first study in the U.S. of an experimental drug aimed at treating the novel coronavirus, the National Institutes of Health said Tuesday.
Researchers at the University of Nebraska have started testing an antiviral drug from Gilead Sciences Inc. The NIH-sponsored study is part of public health officials' race to determine whether remdesivir is effective in treating Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. The study is designed to enroll up to nearly 400 patients globally.
The U.S. remdesivir study is scheduled to be completed in April 2023, but researchers could have preliminary results within a year, said Andre Kalil, a professor at the University of Nebraska who is leading the study for the NIH.
"This is probably the most rapid trial initiation we've seen in American history, because the trial was just designed a few weeks ago at the NIH," he said.

Firms That Rely on Foreign Sales Face Pressure

The U.S. may have so far avoided the worst impacts of coronavirus. But for companies with major operations abroad, the calculus is changing quickly.
The spread of the virus to the industrial heartland of Europe represents the latest shoe to fall as global efforts to contain it ramp up. Disruption to the supply chain for U.S. companies could worsen should countermeasures be needed across Europe, having been introduced in some towns in northern Italy this week, and if parts of Asia remain on lockdown.
For many U.S. companies, there are overseas sales to worry about, too. The S&P 500 companies collectively generate almost 30% of revenue in Asia and Europe, where coronavirus cases have been most prevalent. Many of the companies with more reliance on foreign sales have performed worse than average.
More than 120 companies in the S&P 500 generate less than 50% of revenue from the U.S., according to data from FactSet, which has regional sales breakdowns for nearly 380 companies in the index. These firms saw average share-price declines of 4.7% over the five days to the end of Monday -- worse than the 3.7% average decline among all companies in the index, according to FactSet data.
Performance was even worse among those with greater exposure to non-U.S. markets: The average price decline among 27 companies with less than 25% of revenue from the U.S. was 5.5%.
"I think that the smart money is saying that this will last longer and the economic effects will be deeper than people were thinking," said Mark Stoeckle, chief executive and senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds in Baltimore.
Long-term investors could look to pick up stocks they already liked if values had got relatively cheap, he added, but "we think it's too early to nibble at some more gaming companies, or cruise lines."
Wynn Resorts Ltd., Las Vegas Sands Corp. and Booking Holdings Inc. are among the biggest decliners over the five-day period, each having lost between nearly 9% and nearly 10%. All make less than 25% of their revenue in the U.S.
Cruise-ship operators Carnival Corp., which makes slightly more than half of its revenue outside the U.S., and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., which makes just less than half outside the U.S., also tumbled, down 12% and 18%, respectively, over the five days.
Chip makers and electronics companies have been hit hard because of their direct exposure to Asian markets and their roles in global supply chains. This includes not just well-known names such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Texas Instruments Inc. and Nvidia Corp. but also companies like Lam Research Corp., KLA Corp., Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Synopsys Inc.
There is also evidence that investors have been happier to buy stocks of companies with a more domestic focus: More than 40 companies' shares rose in the five days to the end of Monday, slightly more than half of which have good regional sales data in FactSet. On average, about two-thirds of their sales are in the U.S.

Oil Falls 3% As Traders Reassess Growth View

Oil prices fell again Tuesday, weighed down by investors' concerns about how the spread of the coronavirus outside China will affect oil demand.
U.S. crude prices fell 3% to $49.90 a barrel after losing 3.7% on Monday. Brent, the global gauge of prices, declined 2.4% to $54.95 a barrel after dropping 3.8% the day before.
Investors are still trying to gauge the fallout from the virus. Although China is seeing a drop in new coronavirus cases, outbreaks continue to grow outside the country, spooking investors who had thought the worst had passed.
"Recent developments and signs of worsening outbreaks in countries such as Iran, Italy and South Korea have severely dented this foundational assumption, forcing markets to reassess the severity of the headwinds ahead," analysts at IHS Markit wrote.
Prices were also under pressure from a rift in the partnership between Russia and the Saudi Arabia-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Saudi Arabia is considering a break from its four-year oil-production alliance with Russia after the country rejected a Saudi push to deepen the oil-production curbs.

U.S. Virus Warning Rocks Markets --- CDC Expects Wider Spread As Washington Defends Response

Federal health authorities said they now expect a wider spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. and are preparing for a potential pandemic, though they remain unsure about how severe the health threat could be.
Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Tuesday the agency expects a sustained transmission of the virus and called for businesses, schools and communities to brace themselves and plan for potential outbreaks.
"We expect we will see community spread in this country," meaning the virus circulating within local communities, said Dr. Messonnier. She added the question isn't if the virus will expand in the U.S., but when.
In the U.S., 14 locally diagnosed cases have been confirmed, with an additional 40 from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Asia and three among Americans who returned from China aboard U.S.-chartered flights.
So far, American public-health systems have sought to contain the virus by isolating confirmed cases while monitoring close contacts of these patients for signs of infection. This strategy is most effective when the case count is relatively low and each case can be epidemiologically linked to each other and traced to an original source, health authorities say. That is the current situation with the confirmed U.S. cases.
But if the virus spreads more widely, it might become difficult or impossible to contain it with the current methods, experts say. Instead, the efforts would shift to strategies such as closing schools, canceling mass gatherings and requiring employees to work from home.
"The disruption to everyday life might be severe," Dr. Messonnier said.
Meantime, the Trump administration's response to the virus was challenged Tuesday in Congress. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who heads the U.S. coronavirus task force, was questioned about whether his agency is doing enough, especially in light of its request for $2.5 billion in emergency funding -- less than what was granted to fight earlier threats of pandemics.
"It seems to me at the outset that this request for the money . . . is lowballing it," said Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), the committee's chairman. "You can't afford to do that."
Democrats at the hearing pushed back on recent upbeat assurances about the virus by President Trump on Twitter. "We are disregarding scientific evidence and relying on tweets," said Sen. Patty Murray (D., Wash.). "I'm deeply concerned we are way behind the eight ball on this."
Mr. Trump this month said the coronavirus could go away with warm weather. But the CDC's Dr. Messonnier said in a Feb. 12 media call that she would caution against "overinterpreting that hypothesis."
Mr. Azar, who praised the president's approach, said his agency is requesting the amount of funding that is needed, adding that the administration will work with traditional public-health tools to mitigate a sustained spread if it occurs.
Financial markets fell for the second day on concern about the virus's economic impact, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down nearly 900 points. As the markets slid, several administration officials appeared to temper the CDC's comments about the virus.
Speaking at a media briefing, Mr. Azar said cases in the U.S. are contained and that "people shouldn't panic when we see new cases." He said Dr. Messonnier's comments were aimed at educating the public about possible future actions. White House economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow, speaking on CNBC, said: "We have contained this. I won't say airtight, but pretty close to airtight."
Authorities have tested 426 people in the U.S. for the virus, not including those who have been repatriated. But many state and local health departments lack the test kits they need to diagnose the infections because federal health authorities are still working out kinks in the kits. The limited availability of the kits could hamstring local efforts to handle the anticipated rise in cases and identify cases that now exist, public-health and hospital officials said.
Testing for the virus has been relatively slow because most local health officials must ship patient samples to the CDC in Atlanta and isolate these patients while waiting for the results. That can take days. To speed up diagnoses, the CDC wants to send test kits to state and local health departments.
But the rollout stalled earlier this month after the kits produced inconclusive results during verification testing at state and local health departments.
"We still do not know when the CDC kit replacements will come out, and our members are pretty anxious about it," said Scott Becker, chief executive officer of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. "It doesn't feel like a good place to be."
The CDC said it is working to remanufacture the reagent, the substance used in a chemical reaction in the tests, that is suspected to be at fault for the inconclusive results.
Twelve states and localities are now testing for the virus themselves using kits determined to be effective. The CDC said it hopes commercial tests might be available soon to augment the CDC kit used by health departments and hospitals.

World News: Olympic Official Says Tokyo Games Are in Question

Tokyo is on the way to spending more than $20 billion hosting this summer's Olympic Games. NBC has a multibillion-dollar agreement to broadcast them. Athletes who have been training for years are months away from the pinnacle of their sporting lives.
But there is increasing concern that the Summer Games won't go on at all.
As outbreaks of the novel coronavirus spread through Asia and Europe, organizers made it clear Tuesday that they have begun worrying about the public health implications of holding the Games, where hundreds of thousands of people gather in one place, spend two weeks in close quarters and fly back to some 200 countries.
The Tokyo Games are scheduled to begin on July 24, but a senior member of the International Olympic Committee raised the possibility of cancelation or postponement if the outbreak isn't contained in the next three months, setting an unofficial deadline around the end of May. The last time the Olympics were canceled was during World War II.
"This is the new war and you have to face it," Dick Pound, an IOC member since 1978, told the Associated Press. "In and around that time, I'd say folks are going to have to ask: 'Is this under sufficient control that we can be confident about going to Tokyo, or not?'"
In a subsequent interview with The Wall Street Journal, Pound said that it was impossible to make predictions about the fate of an event five months away.
"If you're dealing with athletes, you say, 'As far as we know, it's still on in Tokyo,'" Mr. Pound said.
A spokesperson for the governing body of the Games said that Mr. Pound "explains very well that the IOC continues to work toward successful Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 beginning at the end of July."
Tokyo 2020 officials have said that they hope to deliver the Games as planned, despite the country reporting hundreds of cases of coronavirus. But fears are already sweeping through sports in Japan.
Japanese soccer authorities on Tuesday announced they would suspend all 94 professional matches scheduled between now and mid-March. Nippon Professional Baseball, too, is expected to announce postponements on Wednesday ahead of Opening Day on March 20. Earlier this month organizers cut more than 30,000 runners from this Sunday's Tokyo Marathon, saying only about 200 elite runners would be allowed in the race.
Mr. Pound said it was unclear who would make the final decision to cancel, postpone or move the Olympics if the virus continues spreading.
The Olympics are a major enterprise for the media companies that broadcast the games, including Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal and Discovery Inc. NBCUniversal agreed to pay $1.1 billion for the Tokyo Games, as part of a long-term deal covering U.S. rights for multiple Olympics. Discovery agreed to pay $1.45 billion for European rights to the games from 2018 to 2024.
Discovery would not have to pay rights fees if the games were canceled, a person familiar with the matter said. An NBC Sports spokesman had no comment on the rights deal.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. officials said Chinese leaders have taken the first steps toward implementing the first phase of a trade deal between the world's two largest economies, a statement that comes amid concerns that the coronavirus could delay the pace of China's promise to purchase more U.S. crops and other goods.
U.S. officials on Tuesday noted that Chinese leaders have lifted import restrictions on U.S. poultry and poultry products and pet food, along with other actions, since the deal took effect on Feb. 14. Those provisions were part of a 90-page written agreement signed in January.
The agreement calls for China to increase its purchases of U.S. agricultural products by $32 billion over a two-year period.
The officials didn't say how much China has agreed to purchase of its roughly $200 billion goal so far.
"President Trump and this Administration negotiated a strong trade agreement with China that promises significant benefits for American agriculture," U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said.
Meanwhile, China has begun announcing tariff exclusions for U.S. imports that were hit with retaliatory measures.
Before the deal, both countries put tariffs on imported goods. U.S. officials later agreed to lift a portion of those tariffs, but the deal left in place U.S. tariffs on about $370 billion in Chinese goods, or about three-quarters of Chinese imports to the U.S.
Since the deal was announced, trade experts have questioned whether China will follow through with its purchase pledges and say the deal's potential failure has the power to sway rural voters in an election year.
They have also questioned whether the spreading coronavirus could derail the deal, which calls for China to purchase more goods over the two-year period.

U.S. Virus Warning Rocks Markets --- Treasury Yields Hit Record Low; Stocks Fall on Disruption Fears

The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to an all-time low Tuesday as stocks swooned for a second straight day, driven by worries the coronavirus could seriously disrupt an already sluggish global economy.
The fall in yields marked the latest milestone in a decadeslong bond rally driven by persistently low inflation. After hovering between 1.5% and 2% for months, the 10-year yield was pushed sharply lower by reports the coronavirus was spreading outside China. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Tuesday of an increased threat to U.S. residents.
As investors fled riskier assets for bonds, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 3%, and notched a two-day decline of more than 1,900 points, or 6.6%, to close at its lowest level since October. The two-session rout has cut an estimated $1.7 trillion from the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Shares of companies as varied as banks, consumer-goods companies and restaurants retreated, underscoring investors' broad fear of a pullback in consumer spending hurting profits. Citigroup slid 4.3%, while Apple fell 3.4%. Stocks briefly opened higher in U.S. trading but quickly gave up those gains, and declines accelerated after the CDC warning.
With Tuesday's declines, eight of the S&P 500's 11 sectors are in negative territory for the year. The worst among them, energy, has shed 19% so far in 2020 -- reflecting investors' fears that a slowdown in global economic activity will drag oil prices lower.
"The size of this economic shock is looking increasingly large on a global scale," said James Athey, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. "What we're just seeing here is the crack in that sentiment-driven equity rally."
The yield on the 10-year note fell as low as 1.310% on an intraday basis and settled at 1.328%, according to Tradeweb, compared with 1.377% Monday. Both of those marks beat lows set in July 2016 after the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union. Yields fall when bond prices rise.
Treasury yields are a key economic gauge, typically rising when growth and inflation are accelerating and sliding when the economy is losing steam. They help determine borrowing costs for consumers, businesses, and state and local governments.
Most analysts agree yields have been depressed in recent years by long-term structural factors, such as slow global growth, even more muted inflation and ultralow interest rates set by the world's major central banks. New coronavirus infections have threatened to exacerbate those conditions by disrupting supply chains, suppressing global travel and potentially leading to a new round of monetary stimulus.
How far Treasury yields fall "depends on how much the virus spreads," said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of fixed-income trading at D.A. Davidson &Co.
One factor that influences Treasury yields is the level of short-term interest rates set by the Federal Reserve. Another is inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of bonds' fixed payments.
As it stands, the Fed's benchmark federal-funds rate is set between 1.5% and 1.75%. An increasing number of investors expect at least two more interest-rate cuts later this year. Meanwhile, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge remains below its 2% annual target.
Until recently, investors have been comforted by forecasts that the economic damage from the coronavirus would be relatively short-lived, both around the world and in the U.S. On Friday, some of that confidence was dented when IHS Markit's measure of manufacturing and service-sector activity fell to its lowest level in more than six years. On Sunday, officials from the Group of 20 major economies warned the virus posed a serious risk to global growth. Stocks fell Monday after largely shrugging off virus concerns in previous weeks.
Looking beyond the record-low yields, analysts said the bond market has been sending mixed signals about the economy. One concern is that the 10-year yield has fallen well below that of the three-month Treasury bill, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve that often occurs before economic contractions.
Still, the 10-year yield remains above the yield of other short-term Treasurys such as the two-year note. Because short-term Treasurys are particularly sensitive to the outlook for monetary policy, that is a sign investors are confident that the Fed will lower rates relatively soon and possibly help the economy -- though Fed officials have largely said they want to see more signs of economic disruption before acting.
Treasury yields have flirted with record lows for years, but stock indexes have continued to climb to records. One reason is that low yields can be helpful to businesses by lowering their borrowing costs. Treasurys are also heavily influenced by economic conditions outside of the U.S., with yields pulled lower by the trillions of dollars worth of bonds elsewhere in the world that carry negative yields.
Yields have generally trended lower since shortly after the Fed raised its key policy rate above 19% in June 1981 in an attempt to tame soaring inflation. These days, many economists are concerned about the lack of inflation. But its absence has provided a base of support for government bonds that has persisted even when investors have grown more optimistic about the economy.
Not all investors think Treasurys will continue rallying. After more than a decade of growth, investors keep worrying that the U.S. economy is going to falter, but "every time this has happened, things have snapped back in the other direction," said Scott Kimball, a portfolio manager at Taplin, Canida &Habacht LLC.

World News: New China Cases Drop as Virus Spreads Globally --- Outbreaks in Italy and Iran continue to grow; South Korea sees a 'clear inflection point'

BEIJING -- The number of new coronavirus cases in China dropped dramatically in recent days outside the province at the center of the epidemic, but health authorities raised alarms about sharp increases in infections elsewhere in the world.
The number of new cases outside Hubei dropped to just nine on Monday, Chinese authorities said, a marked decrease from the peak of nearly 900 new cases that were recorded Feb. 3.
But outside China, outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran continued to grow, spooking global financial markets on concerns that diminished economic activity and increased travel restrictions around the world could sharply hurt global growth.
Federal health authorities in the U.S. also warned on Tuesday that they now expect a wider spread of the virus and are preparing for a potential pandemic.
The sharp increase in numbers in countries outside China showed the power with which a few cases can rapidly multiply, said Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and health economist at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health. "Sometimes all you need is one super spreading event and it can get out of hand," he said.
He said while the improving trend in China is a positive development, it was important to see how the numbers adjust as more people go back to work and travel restrictions are lifted. "I'm not sure if China is out of the woods just yet," Dr. Feigl-Ding said.
In Italy, new cases appeared as far south as Sicily, showing the limits of efforts to quarantine towns and contain the virus mostly to two rural areas near Milan and Venice.
At least 322 people had been confirmed to have contracted the virus in Italy as of late Tuesday, Italian authorities said. The death toll was 10.
In Iran, at least 15 people have been killed by the coronavirus, the country's health ministry said. And there are nearly 100 cases of the infection confirmed, including the man in charge of containing the pathogen's spread in the country.
South Korea, the hardest-hit country apart from China, reported 1,146 cases of coronavirus Wednesday morning -- up from 893 a full day before and just 46 a week ago. The country also reported 11 deaths linked to the virus. South Korea President Moon Jae-in called the next several days a "clear inflection point" as the surge in cases presents challenges for South Korean businesses and the country's trading partners, such as the U.S.
The fall in new infection cases in China comes roughly a month after Jan. 23, when the Chinese government announced an extraordinary lockdown of Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic and the capital of Hubei province. In subsequent days, authorities extended the lockdown to much of the rest of Hubei, a province of nearly 60 million people.
Officials also said the new infections in Hubei province were confined mainly to Wuhan, where the number of new infections Monday dropped to 464 cases, a quarter of the number from a week earlier.
"The risk of virus spreading widely in China has passed," Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the Communist Party publication the Global Times wrote on Twitter late Monday. "Wuhan is still in lockdown while new infection cases are steadily decreasing, even disappearing, in other areas."
The number of new cases in China has declined faster than it would naturally in an outbreak of this type of disease, reflecting the aggressive measures the Chinese government took to stop its spread, said Bruce Aylward, head of an international team of scientists led by the World Health Organization that has just returned from a trip to China.
"They have changed the course of this outbreak," Dr. Aylward said at a press conference in Geneva on Tuesday, pointing to a chart that he said showed an unusual epidemic curve. "Hundreds of thousands of people in China did not get Covid-19 because of this aggressive response."
The nine new infection cases outside of Hubei reflect the lowest daily number since the five reported Jan. 20, the day President Xi Jinping made his first public statement about the outbreak.

Traveler is quarantined at base; Point Mugu naval facility could house more arrivals from LAX, officials say

An international traveler who arrived before dawn Monday at Naval Base Ventura County at Point Mugu has been put under a federal 14-day quarantine for coronavirus, officials said.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said Sunday in a statement that the base could house passengers arriving at Los Angeles International Airport. The department was not immediately available to comment on how many travelers could be sent to the Point Mugu location.
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper assigned the base the task of housing Americans suspected of exposure to coronavirus or possible infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is monitoring anyone who has traveled through Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.
No one being quarantined at the base has displayed any symptoms of coronavirus, Capt. Jeff Chism said in a letter to sailors, families and employees of the naval facility. Anyone showing signs of the illness would be transported off the base.
While under quarantine, doctors will assess whether anyone has contracted COVID-19, which has killed more than 2,600 people -- mostly in China.
Although the base provides a space for the quarantine, officials said it isn't involved in execution and planning. Anyone under quarantine would not have any contact with Department of Defense personnel.
"I am asking for your support as we host a group of people undergoing an uncomfortable transition. First, your safety is a primary concern, as is the dignity and privacy of repatriating personnel," Chism said.
Those at the base have been instructed not to take photos of anyone quarantined during arrival and were warned that "minor changes" to daily life may occur while the quarantine is underway.
Earlier this month, nearly 200 Americans were quarantined at a Riverside County base for two weeks. The group arrived at March Air Reserve Base from China and was released Feb. 11 after all tested negative.
It was the CDC's first mandated quarantine in more than 50 years. It sent health officials scrambling and stirred panic but was viewed as one of the few tools to protect against the spread of the virus, which currently has no vaccine and a two-week incubation period.
According to the CDC, 1,336 of the department's staff have been involved in the COVID-19 response. Of those, 497 have been deployed to 39 locations in the United States and internationally, including CDC quarantine stations at U.S. ports of entry, state and local health departments, hospitals and military bases that are housing quarantined patients.

A real test of global stability

Viruses are known to be almost diabolically opportunistic -- lethal but not too lethal, for example, to keep from killing their hosts so fast as to compromise their ability to be spread.
One might almost think that the coronavirus now making its way around the globe, known formally as COVID-19, deliberately chose its moment of outbreak to wreak maximum human disruption.
It has exploited the interconnectedness of global commerce to threaten havoc on the world economy, as well as skepticism about government competence in America, Europe and China to raise doubts about whether it can be contained.
With some 2,700 deaths among roughly 81,000 reported cases, it has so far wrought disorder in the global supply chain that will interfere with manufacturing worldwide and raised the prospect of lower earnings for consumer and travel and hospitality companies as vulnerable populations or those in high-risk regions are prompted to stay indoors or at home. In China, factories in regions in and around the hard-hit Hubei province closed, though the government has encouraged many to reopen in recent weeks.
Then there's the U.S. stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &Poor's 500 index have each shed about 7.3% of their value in the last three trading days, including Tuesday.
A few major corporations have signaled that the virus is likely to affect their earnings. Apple started the trend last week with a warning that the outbreak would prevent it from meeting its projected financial guidance for the second quarter, ending March 31. The company had projected revenue of between $63 billion and $67 billion for that period. Companies as diverse as Boston Scientific, Expedia, Carnival and General Mills followed with their own warnings.
Apple pointed to both the disruption in its manufacturing, which is centered in China, and to sales of iPhones in China. Boston Scientific, which sells more than $500 million in heart devices and medical scopes in China, warned that the country's focus on diagnosing and treating COVID-19 infections would put many other elective procedures on hold, costing as much as $40 million in revenue.
Yet the earnings impact remains mostly conjectural. The businesses most certain to face revenue declines are airlines. That industry is also the most vulnerable to business slowdowns, as pilot and airline writer Patrick Smith observed Tuesday.
"The world's airlines are terrified, and rightly so," Smith wrote. "Thousands of flights have been canceled, airplanes have been parked, bookings have crashed.... If containment efforts are successful and the contagion rate slows ... air travel will be back to normal within a matter of weeks. If they're not, it's going to be catastrophic, especially for those airlines whose networks rely heavily on international transfers."
Smith also noted that much of the concern among travelers, customers and businesses is divorced from reality, though that doesn't make the concern something to ignore: "The panic, warranted or not, is here and it's irreversible."
At this moment, so little is yet known about the course of the virus' spread or its lethality that the doors are wide open for baseless speculation.
Whether President Trump understands the implications is hard to gauge. In a tweet Monday he seemed to be more interested in the stock market's slide than the public health consequences of the spread of the virus. "Stock market starting to look very good to me," he tweeted. He asserted that "the Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA."
That was contradicted by Nancy Messonnier, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"Ultimately, we expect we will see coronavirus spread in this country," she said Tuesday. "It's not so much a question of if, but a question of when." The prospects were for some disruption of daily life, the CDC advised.
What's clear, however, is that Trump's policies have deprived the U.S. of some of the tools that will be needed to contain an outbreak. Trump's "public charge" rules, which penalize immigrants who have used public services such as Medicaid, have discouraged the targeted population from seeking out public healthcare.
At a time when it's crucial that people who have been exposed to the virus come forward for screening or treatment, driving them underground could have a devastating impact on public health.
Trump's three-year war on the government's scientific infrastructure also looks like sheer folly, now that sound medical and healthcare judgments are desperately needed. As I reported in 2017, he has filled the Department of Health and Human Services with members of the anti-science right wing.
In 2018, as public health writer Laurie Garrett has reported, Trump fired the government's entire pandemic response team. Last year, Trump shut down a program known as Predict, which was charged with tracking and monitoring potential pandemics originating in animals and jumping to human hosts -- like COVID-19.
In his latest budget proposal, Trump has asked Congress to cut the budget for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases more than 7%, a $430-million cut to $5.446 billion for fiscal 2021.
Congress has blocked such budget-cutting proposals from Trump in the past, and is likely to increase those agencies' budgets again. But it's not comforting for those agencies to face such hostility from the White House.
The administration's overall approach to public health is exemplified by its treatment of Medicaid, in which it has encouraged states to impose regulations aimed at throwing low-income residents off the program by subjecting them to complicated reporting requirements. If there are any doubts that a sensible government policy would aim to sign more people up for health coverage, not reduce the rolls, the COVID-19 crisis should dispel them.
Skepticism about government management of the crisis isn't limited to the U.S. Most of the skepticism, in fact, is directed at China, where doubts about the reliability of government statistics have fed fears that the virus spreads faster and is more dangerous than the regime has let on. China has been blamed for downplaying the outbreak during its earlier stages, though its subsequent efforts to combat the infection through community-wide quarantines have been ruthless in their rigor, as only an autocracy can do.
It's easy to read too much into the sketchy information available today about the virus and anti-contagion tactics. That's true of the stock market, which is so well primed to react to events with potential economic impacts that it typically overreacts. An apparent stabilizing trend in the market early Tuesday fell apart after CDC officials issued an advisory that the virus was likely to spread further within the U.S. as infected persons communicated it to others.
The Dow Jones average closed down 879.44 points, or 3.15%, on the day.
Yet a pullback of stock prices was inevitable too. The stock market has been on a nearly unbroken tear to the upside for just over a year. The last "correction," defined as a drop of 10%, occurred from December 2018 to January 2019. Bull runs like those eventually need to blow off steam; often all that's needed is a trigger, and the coronavirus may have been it.
Panic and fear over this disease outbreak aren't going to be washed away quickly, even if a vaccine is soon developed or the virus runs its course. Reluctance to travel will persist, and officials may well continue canceling big public events -- as Italian authorities cut short the annual Venice Carnival and tightened restrictions on Milan's fashion week in recent days.
Businesses will have to learn that as their supply chains become more attenuated and reach into parts of the country where they have little control over events, they'll have to develop Plans B, C and D to cope with the unexpected. The public may learn the dangers of placing people in charge of government who don't project skill at what they're doing or a commitment to the task at hand.
COVID-19 may teach us that although we can muddle through good times without sound planning and competent leadership, in bad times nothing is more important.

Wrapping up a two-day trip, President Trump declined Tuesday to condemn India's new citizenship law, which discriminates against Muslims, and downplayed the threat from the coronavirus, which has spread to more than three dozen countries, claiming it's "very well under control in our country."
At a news conference in New Delhi, the normally opinionated president appeared visibly uncomfortable and tentative at times as he tried to deflect thorny questions about India's religious violence and the guilty verdict for former Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein on rape charges.
When asked about the verdict and whether justice was served, Trump, who has faced numerous sexual misconduct allegations, instead discussed Weinstein in personal and political terms, claiming that Michelle Obama "loved him" and that Weinstein wanted Hillary Clinton to win in 2016.
"I was never a fan of Harvey Weinstein," Trump said. "He said he was going to work hard to defeat me in the election. How did that work out?"
Asked by a reporter to deliver a message to "women in America who are still afraid to come forward and share their stories of sexual harassment and assault," Trump, an avid watcher of TV news, claimed he had not paid close attention to the trial while he was in India. Weinstein was convicted of rape and a felony sex crime Monday in New York.
"I don't know the actual results," Trump said. "From the standpoint of women, I think it was a great thing and it sends a very strong message."
The president was also asked numerous times about the swift spread of the coronavirus, which has panicked the world and roiled financial markets. Medical authorities have confirmed more than 80,000 cases around the world and more than 2,700 deaths.
Trump tried to downplay the threat, claiming that it's "very well under control in our country" and that people infected in the United States "are getting better. They're all getting better."
His comments appeared at odds with a warning Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the coronavirus will hit the U.S. and could cause major disruptions in travel, schools and commerce.
"We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare for the expectation that this is going to be bad," Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on a conference call.
"It's not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country any more but a question of when this will happen," she said.
The CDC has confirmed 53 coronavirus patients in the United States. There is no known cure or vaccine.
Saying he didn't want to say anything to overshadow his "fantastic" trip to India, Trump declined to criticize Prime Minister Narendra Modi's new citizenship law, which excludes Muslims and has helped fuel a new wave of communal violence.
Ten people have been reported killed, and dozens injured, in Muslim-majority neighborhoods north of the capital since Sunday. The clashes between protesters in favor of the law and those against it quickly took on religious overtones, with Hindu and Muslim mobs fighting each other.
The law passed by India's Parliament last year prioritizes citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians while excluding Muslims.
Trump, asked several times about Modi's support for the new law, praised the Indian leader.
"He wants people to have religious freedom," Trump insisted. "They have really worked hard on religious freedom."
Trump appeared to back Modi's concern that the majority-Hindu country is being overrun by Muslims.
"He told me, I guess they have 200-plus, 200 million Muslims in India, and a fairly short while ago, they had 14 million," Trump said.
India had about 35 million Muslims in 1951, according to the first census after independence, or about 10% of the population. The 201 million Muslims today make up about 14% of the population.
Later, Trump was asked again about the citizenship law. "I don't want to discuss that, and hopefully they're going to make the right decision for the people," he said.
The question was awkward for Trump, who has drawn criticism for his own anti-immigrant policies, including his travel ban.
During the 2016 campaign, Trump suggested barring all Muslims from entering the country. After he took office, he issued an executive order banning visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, but that was overturned by federal courts. A later version was upheld and was expanded this month to impose varying visa restrictions on nationals from 13 countries, including several that are not Muslim-majority.
Trump defended the restrictions again Tuesday while insisting they aren't intended to single out Muslims.
The 45-minute news conference, at the ITC Maurya Hotel, followed a day of meetings and statements intended to show the close ties between Washington and New Delhi. Trump then attended a state banquet before boarding Air Force One for his flight home.
Though the sides failed to reach a comprehensive trade deal, Trump claimed victory on smaller agreements to increase trade and expand cooperation in other areas, including efforts to control opioid abuse.
For Trump, a massive public rally Monday at a new cricket stadium in Ahmedabad -- complete with elaborate dancing, Bollywood stars and deafening applause -- clearly was the highlight of his visit.
"When I look at 125,000 seats and that was an incredible scene," he said Tuesday. "It was an incredible thing. Nobody's ever seen anything like it."

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised communities to take precautions in the event that the coronavirus spreads -- something that officials believe to be inevitable.
"Ultimately, we expect we will see coronavirus spread in this country," said Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. "It's not so much a question of if, but a question of when."
Messonnier advised parents to talk to schools about the possibility of internet-based learning in the event that COVID-19 spreads and students would need to refrain from attending classes in a school building, and for businesses to think about how to use teleconferencing meetings in the event that employees would need to work from home. Messonnier said officials would also need to consider whether large community-based events would need to be canceled in such an event.
There is still no vaccine for the virus, which has killed more than 2,700 people -- mostly in mainland China. Though the CDC's mandatory quarantine prompted health officials to scramble and has stirred growing fears within communities, it is one of the few tools officials believe can mitigate the spread of the disease.
Messonnier reminded people to take proactive steps in washing their hands and cleaning exposed surfaces. She also reiterated that despite fears over coronavirus, the flu still poses a greater risk to the public.
There are 53 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States -- 40 of those are repatriated individuals from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
Stock prices plummeted for the second consecutive day as investors grew increasingly skeptical that the virus would soon be contained, thus raising prospects that the outbreak could do further damage to the global economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which had skidded 1,032 points Monday, dropped an additional 879.44 points Tuesday to 27,081.36 for a decline of 3.2%. The blue-chip average now has dived 8.4% since setting a record high Feb. 12.
The S&P 500 fell 3% on Tuesday and the Nasdaq composite index lost 2.8% in the worst selling on Wall Street since the fall of 2018. Stocks of companies involved in travel, energy and consumer goods continued to take the worst hit amid fears of a slowdown in consumer spending and demand for crude oil and gasoline.
American Airlines Group fell 9.2%, Marriott International lost 8%, American Express Co. fell 5.7% and Exxon Mobil Corp. dropped 3.8%. As they fled stocks, many investors continued buying U.S. government bonds.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to a record low 1.34%. There's also speculation that the Federal Reserve might have to cut interest rates in response to any virus-sparked slowdown in economic growth. Richard Clarida, vice chair of the central bank, said in a speech Tuesday that while the U.S. economy "is in a good place" and that "U.S. inflation remains muted," the Fed is "closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus."
He said it was "still too soon to even speculate about either the size or the persistence" of a virus- related economic disruption, but "if developments emerge that, in the future, trigger a material reassessment of our outlook, we will respond accordingly."

Shortages, poor communication beset U.S. preparations

Major U.S. hospital systems are burning through their supplies of specialized masks needed for a widespread epidemic of coronavirus, in part because federal protocols call for them to be thrown out after a single use in practice sessions, federal officials have told health-care leaders.
Some hospitals have just a week's inventory of the N95 face masks, which filter out 95 percent of all airborne particles, even as a top official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Tuesday that spread of the virus in the United States now appears inevitable. 
At a tense invitation-only briefing held last week, the Department of Health and Human Services offered few answers to health-system leaders trying to prepare for wider spread of the coronavirus, according to participants. Parts of the presentation were obtained by The Washington Post. 
The possible mask shortage is one of many critical issues that federal, state and local officials and health-care providers are confronting as the U.S. posture on the covid-19 crisis shifts from keeping the virus that causes the disease out of the country to mitigating its impact here. Already, coordination and communication problems among the various parts of the public health apparatus are beginning to cause difficulties, according to providers on the front lines.
HHS also said 60 percent of large-chain pharmacies are already unable to meet demand at stores for the masks, technically known as respirators.
'Personal protective equipment is not what you think about day-to-day' at most hospitals, said Lauren Sauer, who oversees preparedness and response for Johns Hopkins Medicine and the Johns Hopkins University system. 'What is the plan for allocation of scarce resources? Is it going to be who has the most face time' [with HHS officials] who gets the most supplies?'
CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said the agency's guidance has to be flexible. 'We can't be too specific, because it might not be something a health department or hospital can do, or it might not fit their needs at the moment.'
Many of those involved in the response have been preparing for weeks. But if there was any doubt among them, the CDC eliminated it Tuesday by openly asking Americans to prepare for the disruption that widespread transmission of the virus would cause in their communities.
'Ultimately we expect we will see community spread in the United States,' said Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, who described a breakfast-table conversation she had with her own children. 'It's not a question of if this will happen but when this will happen, and how many people in this country will have severe illnesses.'
Messonnier outlined scenarios she said Americans now must contemplate, including school and day-care closings, increased teleworking and limiting, postponing or canceling mass gatherings. She did not mention lockdowns like the one that has paralyzed central China, the epicenter of the outbreak that has killed more than 2,400 people and sickened more than 80,000. The United States so far has 57 known cases and no deaths.
Hospitals and public health officials on the leading edge of the U.S. mitigation strategy have been getting ready for weeks.
In San Antonio, for example, Metro Health Director Dawn Emerick said she is rounding up 30 recreational vehicles that might be used to house infected people and looking for a place to put them. The city already has 11 people who were evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship and Wuhan, China, in isolation rooms in a special facility, but Emerick anticipates greater need as tests of more people come in.
At one point, Emerick halted the RV plan when federal officials told her that sick people evacuated from Asia to nearby Lackland Air Force Base would be sent to a facility on a former Army base in Anniston, Ala. But when officials in that state objected, the RV plan was resurrected, she said.
'What we've been trying to do at the local level is look at alternatives that are safe, that are away from the community,' Emerick said.
At the sprawling NYU Langone Health system in New York, which has nearly 1,700 inpatient beds at six facilities, doctors are working to prevent patients from swamping hospitals with minor respiratory complaints and crowding out patients who may need more intensive care.
They are ramping up messaging that tells people how to arrange online appointments with providers and other alternatives, said Michael S. Phillips, chief hospital epidemiologist for the system.
Similarly, hospitals in Washington state are discussing triaging patients in parking lots 'and if it's really bad, people can get a drive-through screening in their car,' said state Health Secretary John Wiesman.
The Hopkins health system also has contingency plans to use nonmedical spaces, such as cafeterias, a children's play area and ambulance ramps to treat respiratory patients. The ambulance ramp is set up to accommodate a tent and has heated water, gas lines and electricity.
Health systems need more specific guidance, Sauer said. 
'We've maxed out on our capacity to prepare without additional pieces of information,' she said. 'People would really like to see something concrete from the federal government, like say, 'It's a pandemic, it's time to shift strategies to mitigation.' '
Guidance from the CDC on the use of face masks has too many caveats, said Russell Faust, medical director of the health department in Oakland County, Mich. Under current federal guidelines, after a mask is adjusted to form a seal over an individual's mouth and nose during a test run, it should be thrown away. 
The CDC recommended that providers 'consider' extended use or repeat use of the respirator, he said. 
'They're waffling big time,' Faust said. 'That is a little concerning. We hope that at some point, someone will say, 'Here's what you do when you run out of N95 respirators.' '
Faust already has developed a workaround. If coronavirus arrives, Oakland County personnel will put surgical masks over N95s, protecting the underlying mask somewhat so it can be used again.
NYU is already working to conserve 'personal protective equipment' " full-body 'moon suits,' masks, face shields and other gear " for a shortage that Phillips considers inevitable. Many masks used in U.S. hospitals come from Hubei province in China, where the outbreak began. And when production in China resumes, equipment surely will be reserved for use in that country, he said. About 65 percent of N95 respirators are manufactured outside the continental United States, in China and Mexico, according to HHS data.
NYU is urging health care personnel to re-use moon suits now to help preserve inventory for later. That is appropriate, for example, in treating patients with tuberculosis, he said. Face masks can be used again by the same person, especially after practice sessions, he said.
'We are really looking carefully at how we're utilizing [protective equipment], and I think every hospital in the United States is girding for these kind of shortages,' Phillips said.
While some hospitals have as many as 14 weeks worth of masks on hand, the overall situation is grim. India, Taiwan and Thailand also have halted or limited exports as they brace for spikes in demand in their own countries.
Anticipating a surge in need, California's state officials have ordered 300,000 masks to distribute to hospitals and clinics on an emergency basis, hoping to add to the 20,000 currently in state stockpiles. Officials would not say where they hope to find that many masks.
Health care systems nationally have about two weeks of supply left on hand, said Soumi Saha, senior director of advocacy at Premier Inc., a large group purchasing organization that serves 4,000 hospitals.
Normally, an average of 2 million masks per month are used in the United States, Premier said. That rises to 4 million per month during a typical flu season. 
Two domestic manufacturers that use raw material from the United States " 3M and Prestige Ameritech " are ramping up production but are not expected to be able to satisfy demand of 4 -million masks a month until April, Saha said. 
'I don't think hospitals can sort of buy their way out of this problem. It is not a bidding war for N95s,' said Amy Ray, director of infection prevention for the MetroHealth System in Cleveland. 'The supply is the supply, and prudence is necessary to preserve the stock that we have.''

Don't panic about stocks during virus outbreak

The spread of the coronavirus is spooking investors, and the result has been some significant drops this week.
By the time the markets closed on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 1,900 points, 6.59-percent, over two days, after news reports that the health scare was widening around the world " the worst two-day percentage loss in two years.
Other benchmarks " the S-P 500 and Nasdaq " also plunged amid the coronavirus-fueled volatility. 
But the dives are more about people's fears than the facts, according to certified financial planners (CFPs) and certified public accountants (CPAs) I polled. The one thing they all recommended: Don't panic and jump completely out of the stock market " even if you're retired. 
Steven Podnos is a fee-only investment adviser based in Florida who also happens to be a critical-care doctor in the Air Force Reserve. 
'As a physician, the coronavirus looks no more virulent than influenza, so the impact is likely to be temporary and of little long-term concern,' he told me. 
Clearly the burgeoning number of cases of coronavirus worldwide is worrisome. South Korea, Italy and Iran reported sharp increases in cases this past week. There have been more than 2,600 deaths in China, where the virus originated. 
However, contrast this with the number of Americans who die each year from the flu, Podnos said. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there were 34,200 deaths in the United States from influenza during the 2018-2019 flu season. As of Tuesday, more than 50-people in the United States have tested positive for the coronavirus. 
'If you look at infections outside of China, the mortality looks very, very low,' Podnos said. 'And the people who are dying tend to be the old and immuno-suppressed or otherwise sick.'
As an investor, it's not that you shouldn't be concerned about how the spread of the virus will impact businesses " especially those with manufacturing partners in China, considering that the country is a major player in the global economy. But resist your instinct to flee equities, echoed Lynn Ballou, a CFP in California. 
'Right now is the time to be thoughtful and not to be driven by fear,' Ballou said. She added that it's like when her father was teaching her to drive and cautioned that if she started to lose control of her car in bad weather, she should steer into the-skid. 
'I looked at him and said, 'That sounds like the opposite thing I should be doing,' ' she said. 'But in fact, that's exactly right.' 
This advice may not work for newer front-wheel or all-wheel drive vehicles, but the general instruction about keeping calm and steering in the direction you want to go still applies when it comes to investing. 
Keep in mind what happened during the Great Recession, when many people panicked and sold all of their stock holdings, Ballou said. Those who realized later that they needed growth to keep pace with inflation had to get back into the market. 
'So when did they buy back in? Did they wait until the market had already completely recovered? Basically what they did was sold low and bought high,' Ballou said. 
If you've got decades before you plan to retire, you can afford to keep steering into stocks. 
'Increase your investing amounts,' said David Holland, a Florida-based CFP. 'No one should let one event or one day's market activity dictate their overall financial, investing and retirement plans.'
Okay, if you're five to 10 years from retirement, you may be wondering: What about me? 
'Remember that just because retirement is on the horizon doesn't mean you should sell out of your entire portfolio during the first signs of a market downturn, as many retirees will need their portfolios to last for 20-plus years,' said Betterment CFP Corbin Blackwell of New York. 
For the vast majority of clients who are less than a few decades out from retirement, California CPA Doug Radtke recommends a more conservative portfolio allocation: a 60/40 investment mix of equities and fixed-income products.
'Consider looking for recession-proof fund mixes that include stocks for businesses that succeed even in slower times " such as water utilities or certain consumer products,' Radtke said.
Retired already? 
All the financial planners and CPAs suggest that you should have money set aside " three to five years' worth of your income needs " that isn't impacted by roller-coaster swings in the stock market. 
'Fortunes are made and lost during volatile times,' said Daniel Morris, a CPA in California. 'A diversified portfolio limits the gains and limits the losses to maintain some equitable smoothness.' 
So, what's the takeaway if you're saving for retirement? 
The stock market will do what it does " rise and fall. If you've got a plan based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon, don't let fear make you swerve in the wrong direction and lose traction.

Global markets extended a two-day rout Tuesday as coronavirus fears deepened in Europe and the United States, and as companies around the world continued to grapple with a weeks-long factory shutdown in China.
A warning from health officials about the virus's 'inevitable' spread in the United States pushed the Dow Jones industrial average down another 879 points Tuesday, marking a 6.59 percent loss so far this week, its worst two-day performance in two years. The broad Standard - Poor's 500 closed at 3,128, down 6.28 percent over the past two days. The Nasdaq composite finished the day down 2.77 percent at 8,965.
An expanding outbreak in Italy, and new infections in Spain, Austria, Croatia and Switzerland, helped batter markets in Europe and Asia as well, and pushed oil prices below $50 a barrel. 
U.S. and Western companies awaiting products from stalled Chinese factories say the next few weeks will be critical for the global economy. If their suppliers spring back to life soon, many companies say they should be able to manage without disastrous disruption. But the uncertainty is keeping managers up at night.
The variables go beyond the number of employees allowed to return to work after weeks of quarantine. Factories will need enough raw materials to restore production, and enough protective masks to keep workers safely in place for the foreseeable future. They'll also need Chinese truckers and functioning ports to ensure that goods make it to market.
'We're about a month to six weeks delayed in receiving product,' said James Mault, the founder of a medical device company in Denver, calling that a bearable situation. 'But it certainly will impact us dramatically if it goes beyond that.'
Mault is hanging his hopes on March 1 " this Sunday. That's the day his Chinese manufacturing partner is supposed to reopen after shutting down due to the coronavirus. The engineers are already back to work at the facility in southern China, which makes medical equipment for several Western companies. Other factories are expected to remain closed until mid-March.
For many U.S. companies, the coronavirus has exacerbated troubles they were already having manufacturing in China, after the Trump administration last year levied large import tariffs on Chinese-made goods.
The virus is also hitting multinational companies that sell their goods inside China, where mass quarantines have stalled one of the world's biggest markets. John Deere last week said its sales of road-building equipment, which usually makes up 10 to 15 percent of sales, have softened over the past month as construction has halted in China.
Fast-food chains and other retailers, including Starbucks, Domino's Pizza and Lululemon, have closed stores in China or postponed new-store openings. American Axle - Manufacturing, an auto parts maker based in Detroit, said it expects about $25 million in lost sales during February and early March as car manufacturing slumps in China. Tesla, which recently opened a Shanghai factory to build its Model 3 for Chinese customers, said in January that it expected the virus to 'slightly impact' profitability.
Even businesses operating far from China expect some distress, though the magnitude is still unclear. 
'You can't shut the factories that produce the goods that go on the ships that come to the trains that feed North American appetite for goods down and not have some kind of impact,' Keith Creel, chief executive of Canadian Pacific Railway, told a gathering of investors last week, according to a transcript.
Some nimble U.S. companies have shifted manufacturing out of China to escape the coronavirus shutdown. Azazie, an online bridal retailer headquartered in San Jose, normally makes its dresses at 50 factories across China but recently moved some of its production to Cambodia and Vietnam.
Many multinational companies are deeply entrenched in Chinese manufacturing. Apple warned last week that it expects to fall short of revenue goals in the current quarter due to stalled iPhone production in China and lower demand from Chinese consumers.
Mault said his start-up BioIntelliSense considered moving production of its medical devices to another location in Asia, Mexico or the United States. 'But the time it would take us to relocate the tools and get a manufacturing line stood up right now, we're still looking at a much more reliable scenario' to stay put in China, he said.
The company had been planning to start shipping its new product " a battery-powered sensor that monitors patients' vital signs " to hospitals by the end of March but is now aiming for April or May.
MGA Entertainment, the company behind Bratz and L.O.L. Surprise! dolls, said some of its factories in China are beginning to open, but they're having trouble getting raw materials, from resin and cardboard to steel and doll hair.
MGA's factory in Hudson, Ohio, is running overtime to churn out Little Tikes toys, but chief executive Isaac Larian said the facility only has enough Chinese-supplied raw materials " including wheel axles for toy cars and electronics for play kitchens " to last another month.
'Every day is crucial and, really, the next two weeks are going to show whether we can turn things around or not this year,' Larian said. 'The timing couldn't be worse. In 41 years in the toy business, this is the worst disaster I've seen.'
The hardest-hit manufacturers are in the heart of the coronavirus outbreak, in Hubei province. Cummins, a diesel engine manufacturer headquartered in Indiana, said its Chinese manufacturing sites outside Hubei province have reopened, but some of its sites in Hubei won't open until at least March 11.
Cummins and other companies are scrambling to ensure that they have enough masks to protect returning workers. Different provinces have different rules about how many masks factories must provide each worker per day before they can reopen, said Steve Lamar, chief executive of the American Apparel - Footwear Association.

The coronavirus crisis has killed more than 2,200 people, virtually all of them in China. Fears that the virus will metastasize to countries incapable of containing it, and knock the wind out of a bustling world economy in the process, have gone far in ensuring that the crisis remains the world’s Big Story this February.
While Chinese social media shows widespread fear, grief, and anger at the Communist Party in Beijing for its inept handling of the crisis, and for punishing journalists and ordinary citizens for “spreading rumors,” i.e., the truth, party leader Xi Jinping has called on officials within the nation’s powerful propaganda apparatus to “strengthen the guidance of public opinion.”
The Chinese Communist Party’s firm determination to shape the narrative of important events for its own people, and for the world, is at the heart of another story with the potential to make the coronavirus crisis seem like small potatoes: the simmering rivalry between China and the United States for geopolitical dominance of Asia and the Pacific. Defense and foreign policy analysts are increasingly concerned that that a misstep by one party or the other in the seas off Taiwan, or on the South China Sea, might trigger a shooting war.
They worry that the Chinese party leadership’s abidingly negative views of the United States, and its emerging strategy for dealing with the China’s rise, could lead to a military clash that neither side wants. If mutual understanding plays a role in preventing great power competition from sliding into war—and of course it does—then understanding China’s views of its strategic rival is crucially important.
To say that Chinese policymakers, military officers, and academics take a dim view of America is a colossal understatement. A close examination of recent speeches and writing about the United States by such authorities reveals a clear consensus: America is not merely a strategic rival. America is an adversary. America is not to be trusted.
And it’s a dangerous adversary, because it’s bent on preventing China from taking its rightful place in world affairs and preserving America’s “provocative” military dominance of Asia.
Cynicism about the United States runs very deep among China’s elite, and a massive domestic propaganda campaign concerning American intentions has greatly eaten away at the generally favorable opinions most ordinary Chinese once held about the United States.
As Beijing sees it, American foreign policy since World War II has been invariably self-serving and exploitative, not only toward China, but toward the entire developing world. Even America’s post-Cold War policy of engagement and openness toward Beijing, which has contributed significantly to China’s astonishing economic rise, is interpreted by Chinese political leaders and scholars as having served first and foremost the interests of Washington.
America’s international support for human rights in Hong Kong and within the PRC, claims leading Chinese Communist Party member Li Quiu, is little more than a “pretext to influence and limit China’s healthy economic grown and prevent China’s wealth and power from threatening American hegemony.”
Official statements intended for the outside world call attention again and again to China’s peaceful intentions and respect for order in pursuing a more assertive foreign policy. In fact, though, Chinese military and political leaders have been flagrantly violating the rules-based international order on a regular basis since 2012, intimidating and coercing neighboring powers with economic blackmail and military intimidation.
In July 2016, an independent arbitration tribunal established under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) published a clear and binding ruling against China’s claims vis-à-vis the Philippines in the South China Sea. China’s response at the time was to dismiss the ruling as “nothing more than a piece of waste paper.”
The current international system, according to the senior leadership of the Communist Party, is rigged in favor of the United States and her closest allies. “One of the things that fascinated me about the Chinese,” writes the former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army General Martin Dempsey, “is that whenever I would have a conversation about international standards or international rules of behavior, they would inevitably point out that those rules were made when they were absent from the world stage.”
Now that China is indisputably back on that stage, President Xi Jinping and his senior colleagues have allocated trillions of dollars to create alternative international institutions and rules to those of the current system. The China Development Bank, not the World Bank, is now the leading financier of international development projects. China’s Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious effort to link the economies and cultures of more than 60 countries in Asia, Europe, and North Africa with fast trains, state of the art airports, fiber optics, and favorable trading terms, is already roughly 12 times the size of America’s post-World War II Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Europe. It’s sure to continue to grow for quite some time.
Taken together, said Xi Jinping in a recent speech, these initiatives offer “a new option for other countries who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence.”
Yuan Peng, a leading PRC expert on international relations, believes China must now seize the opportunity to “modify unreasonable international mechanisms… including international or regional organizations, regimes, and laws” to reflect Beijing’s increasingly influential place in world affairs.
Writing in Debating China, a fascinating anthology of short essays on various aspects of the U.S.-China relationship by American and Chinese experts, Wu Xinbo asserts that the great threat to stability and prosperity in Asia is not China’s refusal to play by the rules, but America’s current effort to strengthen its alliances in the region and sell sophisticated weaponry to Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, among others. If the United States truly wants peace, writes Wu, it should stop “fanning the flames of dispute in the South China Sea.”
Ironically, China’s seizure and subsequent militarization of seven small islands in that Sea has greatly alarmed many of its neighbors, causing them to seek reassurances and closer ties to the Washington.
“China doesn’t like the U.S. self-proclaimed leadership [in Asia],” opines Wu Xinbo, “which compromises the aspirations of other regional members …Beijing also suspects that Washington’s intended role of balancer serves only to check a rising China, undermining its legitimate interests in the region.” America, he says, should strive to be a partner rather than the dominant military power.
In July 2019, Beijing issued its first major statement on military strategy since 2015. China’s National Defense in the New Era is clearly a rejoinder to Washington’s 2017 National Security Strategy, which identifies China’s new, aggressive foreign policy and rapid military buildup as the foremost threat to American national interests and stability in Asia. The new Beijing white paper turns that critique on its head, identifying the United States as the rogue nation:
The US has… provoked and intensified competition among major countries, significantly increased its defense expenditure, pushed for additional capacity in Nuclear, outer space, cyber and missile defense, and undermined global strategic stability …The US is strengthening its Asia-Pacific military alliances and reinforcing military deployment and intervention, adding complexity to regional security. The deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in the Republic of Korea by the US has severely undermined the regional strategic balance and the strategic security interests of regional countries. 
In a recent speech clearly meant to be heard loud and clear in Washington, Xi Jinping seemed to suggest that the United States, which has guaranteed the freedom of the seas in Asia for more than 70 years and played a key role in China’s rise, ought to pull up stakes and get out of Asian affairs all together: “In the final analysis, it is for the people of Asia to run the affairs of Asia, solve the problems of Asia, and uphold the security of Asia.”
When Graham Allison, a Harvard professor who recently penned a bestselling book on the U.S.-China relationship called Destined for War, asked a Chinese colleague what China’s “essential message” for the United States was, he proffered this reply: “butt out!”
What seems to gall Beijing more than any other single issue between the two great powers is the Trump administration’s refusal to “butt out” of Taiwan. The depth of the PRC’s desire to unite Taiwan with the mainland is hard to overstate. Beijing blames the United States for preserving the island’s political independence by selling large quantities of sophisticated weapons systems, and committing itself, albeit ambiguously, to defending the island in the event of any attempt by China to take it by force.
Indeed, President Donald Trump has gone out of his way to express solidarity with Taiwan’s democracy of 23 million people, the vast majority of whom would rather be dead than come under Beijing’s control. George W. Bush and Barack Obama refused to sell F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan for fear of upsetting Beijing. Trump approved the sale of 66 aircraft to Taiwan’s air force.
In March 2018, Trump signed into law the Taiwan Travel Act, a bill that gives the administration the legal right to shift U.S. policy toward Taiwan in a way that was guaranteed to stick in Xi Jinping’s craw. The legislation permits U.S. government officials at all levels to travel to Taiwan and to meet with their Taiwanese counterparts, while high-level Taiwanese officials are permitted to enter the United States “to meet with U.S. officials, including officials from the Departments of State and Defense.”
Beijing is infuriated by American “interference” in what it sees as an entirely internal matter. The island’s continued independence, writes Jia Qingguo of Peking University in Debating China, “is an enduring symbol of China’s weakness and humiliation… Unifying the country has become a most cherished aspiration of the Chinese people.”
The July 2019 defense white paper delves deeply into the Taiwan problem, expressing great impatience with Washington about the issue, and goes on to confirm that Beijing stands ready to use force if necessary and hints that it may do so in the not-too-distant future.
Which brings us back to Allison’s book, Destined for War. The professor examined no less than 14 cases in history when a rising power challenged a dominant state or states. Alarmingly, in 10 of the 14 cases, major wars resulted, including the two most costly wars in human history, when a rising Germany was defeated by great powers twice in the 20th century, and a rising Japan was crushed by the United States in the Pacific in 1945.
Historically speaking, then, strategic rivals have had a difficult time escaping “Thucydides’ Trap”—the phenomenon first identified by the Greek fifth century BC historian who wrote, “It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made war inevitable.”
The good news is that Allison joins many other leading scholars in believing the United States and China can escape the Trap. But doing so is going to take a tremendous effort on both sides. Multiple channels of communication must be opened and nurtured in order to manage what is sure to be an intense political, economic, and military competition. Particularly on the military front, the two powers must develop a wide-ranging set of procedures and protocols for operating in the same seas and managing and containing emerging crises. And they must continue to work together, as they have long done, on global problems of mutual interest like climate change, piracy, terrorism, and international commerce.
Just as U.S. policymakers need to accept that China’s rise entitles it to greater influence in international affairs, so the Chinese must develop a less cynical, more realistic picture of American intentions and motivations. Preserving peace is next to impossible to maintain when you demonize your rival, and that is precisely what the current party line from Beijing has been doing for a number of years now. Each power has to accept the existence of the other, and work in good faith to avoid a potentially catastrophic war.
Odd Arne Westad, a professor of Global Affairs at Yale, made an interesting suggestion in a recent article in Foreign Affairs. Perhaps the enormous challenges posed by the rise of China to the United States will unite a polarized and frustrated American body politic and give the country a badly needed sense of mission and purpose. But worse things could happen—and they will—if China doesn’t also take a more measured and realistic view of America’s intentions in the global arena.

China Lifts Import Restrictions on U.S. Farm Goods; Chinese leaders have removed barriers on U.S. poultry, poultry products and pet food, along with other actions, U.S. officials say

WASHINGTON—U.S. officials said Chinese leaders have taken the first steps toward implementing the first phase of a trade deal between the world's two largest economies, an announcement that comes amid concerns that the coronavirus could delay the pace of China's promise to purchase more U.S. crops and other goods.
U.S. officials on Tuesday noted that Chinese leaders have lifted import restrictions on U.S. poultry and poultry products and pet food, along with other actions, since the deal took effect on Feb. 14. Those provisions were part of a 90-page written agreement signed in January.
The deal calls for China to increase its purchases of U.S. agricultural products by $32 billion over a two-year period. The officials didn't say how much China has agreed to purchase of its roughly $200 billion goal so far.
"President Trump and this Administration negotiated a strong trade agreement with China that promises significant benefits for American agriculture," U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said.
Meanwhile, China has begun announcing tariff exclusions for U.S. imports that were hit with retaliatory measures. Before the deal, both countries put tariffs on imported goods. U.S. officials later agreed to lift a portion of those tariffs, but the deal left in place U.S. tariffs on about $370 billion in Chinese goods, or about three-quarters of Chinese imports to the U.S.
Since the deal was announced, trade experts have questioned whether China will follow through with its purchase pledges and say the deal's potential failure has the power to sway rural voters in an election year. They have also questioned whether the spreading coronavirus could derail the deal, which calls for China to purchase more goods over the two-year period.
This month, White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said he expected the fallout from the deadly coronavirus to delay—but not derail—the economic boost the U.S. anticipated from the deal. Any purchase delays by China, however, could be made up with a surge of buying later.
The phase-one deal also calls for China to step up purchases of manufactured goods by $77.7 billion. The category of tech services, which includes charges for cloud computing-related services and the use of intellectual property, is projected to grow by $37.9 billion. Energy purchases will increase by $52.4 billion under the deal.
"We will ensure the agreement is strictly enforced for the benefit of our workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses," said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who led the China trade negotiations.

Making Sense of Stocks' Rude Awakening to Virus Scare; Look below the surface of the S&amp;P 500 and the market mostly reflected investors' concerns

Did stocks tank on Monday because they were finally noticing danger signs that the bond market has been screaming about for weeks? Or did equities just react in a reasonable way to the rapid spread of Covid-19 in South Korea and Italy over the weekend?
The answer matters because overexuberant shares tend to fall further and faster than they otherwise would. That means the virus-induced stock selloff could turn into a nasty recoupling if there was an irrational divergence between bonds and the stock market.
Bears have been arguing for weeks that stock markets have diverged from bonds. Stocks also seemed to separate from other assets as the U.S. and European markets hit new highs up to last Wednesday. The havens of gold, bond prices—which move inversely to yields—and the dollar were up while economically sensitive industrial metals and crude oil prices tumbled. Stocks are risky assets, and usually fall when there is a search for safety, so this performance was odd.
Yet, look below the surface of the S&P 500 and the market mostly reflected investors' concerns: Defensive stocks able to ride out a weak economy did well. Economy-exposed cyclical stocks did badly. The strong performance of technology stocks messes up many assessments, but even that has some justification.
Consider three pieces of evidence. First, many sectors of the market did precisely what one would expect. Even before Monday's plunge, the energy sector was down 8.7% including dividends from Jan. 20, the day human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus was confirmed. The commodity-sensitive materials sector was the next-worst performer, although down only 1.2%. Meanwhile, utilities and real estate were both up more than 5%, benefiting from lower bond yields and their status as bond alternatives. Stocks with reliable dividends also did well, aside from the horrible performance of major oil companies Exxon Mobil and Chevron.
Underperforming the market, and falling a little, were the industrial and financial sectors, sensitive to the global economy and interest rates. The dull consumer-staples sector beat the market, as it usually does in bad times.
Out of place was the better performance of cyclical consumer-discretionary stocks, up 2.6%, which seems odd until you realize that Amazon.com is almost a third of the sector. Strip it out, and the rest fell on average almost 4%, exactly what should be expected as concerns about the new virus grew. Amazon is treated by investors as a technology growth stock, and tech is the sector that doesn't neatly fit the normal cyclical-defensive split. Tech was still up 2.2% by Friday's close, ahead of the market, before falling hard on Monday.
This brings us to the second piece of evidence: duration. The longer in the future that profits are likely, the more sensitive a stock should be to bond yields, as a proxy for the rate at which future profits should be discounted back into today's valuation. The lower the rate, the higher the current value of future profits.
Of course, this is true only all-else being equal. Rates will be lower because the economy is expected to be hit by the virus, which also means lower profits.
But for the fast-growing companies where much or all of their value lies in their hoped-for dividends far in the future—Amazon and Netflix are leading examples—worry about a temporary, contained outbreak was more than offset by lower bond yields. These sort of "growth" companies soared above cheap "value" stocks as bond yields fell, and the tech sector has a lot of them. Meanwhile, mature tech stocks paying higher dividends than the S&P on average fell almost 3% from Jan. 20 through Friday, because they don't have the long-duration growth to offset the Covid-19 damage.
Finally, the credit markets have been telling the same story as the equity markets: an expectation of a contained outbreak, not something that will cause a recession or crush the weakest junk bonds.
Yields of the lowest grade of junk, CCC, rose from 9.6 percentage points above Treasurys to a peak of 10.6 points in the late-January panic, but came back into just 9.8 points by Friday. This rise in the spread was smaller than the drop in Treasury yields, so the CCC yield on Friday was slightly below where it was on Jan. 20, according to the ICE BofA index. These are the companies most likely to fail in a recession, so their resilience suggests little investor fear.
Put it all together and it looks like investors shifted over the weekend from a belief in an economy weakened a bit by coronavirus problems in China to growing concern about a much more serious global problem . This really matters, both for human health and stock prices. But it is a reasonable response to the news about a hard-to-predict viral outbreak.

News of a rapidly worsening coronavirus epidemic sent stocks from London to Hong Kong tumbling and government bond yields skidding to record lows.
But for some individual investors like Robbie Daymond, it was a buying opportunity.
As soon as the 37-year-old voice actor in Los Angeles saw U.S. stock futures sliding early Monday, he tried to log into his brokerage account with Charles Schwab Corp. to put in some buy orders for shares of chip makers that were falling. (His bet: that the stocks would soon rebound.)
He might have had too much company. He was stymied by technical difficulties that took down Schwab and Fidelity Investments' brokerage accounts for some time Monday morning—with the former firm attributing the outage in part to unusually high activity.
"I would have made money this morning, but there's no point now," Mr. Daymond said.
For many individuals, market dips like the one that deepened Monday into Tuesday have become events to wince at, but not panic over. Over the course of the more than decadelong bull market, stocks have so reliably recovered from shocks ranging from elections to terrorist attacks that many investors have grown to believe it is rarely worth pushing the sell button at the first sign of trouble.
"I know it can go down and it can go back up," said Barbara North, a 76-year-old semiretired consultant in Oak Ridge, N.C.
Ms. North said she doesn't fixate on the market's day-to-day performance, in part because she has a financial adviser looking after her investments.
"I don't really get concerned and pay that much attention unless it's going on a downward trend and stays down for a long period of time," she said.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Are you making changes to your portfolio because of the coronavirus epidemic? If so, what are you doing? Join the conversation below.
Jeffrey Zwerdling, by contrast, watches the market very closely. But the 75-year-old partially retired attorney of Glen Allen, Va., said Monday he was planning to hold steady with his investments.
"I'm concerned, but I believe in the companies that I own," he said. "They continue to make good money, they continue to pay a good dividend, regardless of the price of the stock."
Institutions have long characterized individual investors—known in the industry as retail investors—as being quick to panic, sending sell orders at the first sign of a market downturn and missing out on subsequent rebounds. But interviews with individual investors, financial advisers and other investment professionals around the country suggest that many retail investors have been sanguine in the face of the epidemic.
"It's been calm," Mitchell Goldberg, president of wealth-management firm ClientFirst Strategy in Melville, N.Y., wrote in an email as the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid more than 900 points in the first few hours of trading Monday.
At Omnia Family Wealth in Aventura, Fla., it was business as usual on Monday.
"We haven't had a single email or phone call about it," said Steven Wagner, chief executive and co-founder of the wealth management firm.
Not all individual investors were at ease, though. For many, the turning point appeared to occur over the weekend, when reports showed the coronavirus epidemic spreading well beyond China to countries as far away as Italy and Iran, and instances of sickness occurring in people who hadn't traveled to China.
TD Ameritrade Inc. said it observed clients buying assets like bonds, gold and products that track the Cboe Volatility Index—Wall Street's "fear gauge," which tends to rise when stock prices fall. Some clients also appeared to be selling stocks "to lock in profits after an incredible run in the market," said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.
At Bel Air Investment Advisors, which counsels wealthy individuals and families, Chairman Todd Morgan began getting inquiries from clients when stock futures resumed trading late Sunday. He arrived at his Los Angeles office at 6 a.m. Pacific time Monday to the sound of phone calls.
"You hear phones ringing from people wondering what they should do," he said. "It's impacting people's comfort level."
But like many other investment advisers, Mr. Morgan said he has been advising his clients to stay the course.
"I think this too will blow over, but it isn't going to be today," he said.

Dow Industrials Close Nearly 900 Points Lower; Treasury yields hit new bottom, Nasdaq's 2020 gains vanish as markets signal growing virus concern

A rout in global financial markets deepened Tuesday, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average down nearly 900 points and heightening the anxiety of investors around the world.
The latest wave of selling marked the blue-chip benchmark's worst two-day percentage decline in two years. Fear rippled across financial markets, sending the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note to a record low and crude-oil prices tumbling below $50 a barrel.
For much of the past several weeks, money managers have been fixated on one issue: the potential for a growing coronavirus epidemic to hit global economic activity.
Hope that health officials would be able to contain the epidemic, resulting in only a short-term disruption to growth, had helped keep stocks near all-time highs up until just last week. But in the past two days, that optimism has increasingly turned into skepticism —wiping out what S&P Dow Jones Indices estimated amounted to $1.7 trillion from the U.S. stock market.

Shares of companies as varied as banks, consumer-goods companies and restaurants retreated, underscoring investors' broad fear of a pullback in consumer spending hurting profits. Citigroup slid 4.3%, while Apple fell 3.4% and IHOP parent Dine Brands Global dropped 8.1%.
"The size of this economic shock is looking increasingly large on a global scale," said James Athey, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. "What we're just seeing here is the crack in that sentiment-driven equity rally."
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 879.44 points, or 3.1%, to 27081.36, ending at its lowest level since October. The S&P 500 fell 97.68 points, or 3%, to 3128.21 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 255.67 points, or 2.8%, to 8965.61, erasing its gain for the year.
Major indexes opened modestly higher Tuesday but erased their gains within the first hour of the trading day. Markets hit new lows after reports showed the disease had spread even further and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned it was preparing for a potential pandemic.
The market had showed signs of fragility well before stock exchanges even opened for trading in New York. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Dow had rallied overnight, seeming to point to a potential rebound for the stock market in the hours ahead. But the gains proved fickle—with much of them fading by sunrise.
"Every effort at a snapback rally has been just as quickly pushed back down," said Frank Cappelleri, executive director of brokerage Instinet. "The fact that [futures' gains] didn't even get through the night—it probably put a lot of traders on edge."
With Tuesday's declines, eight of the S&P 500's 11 sectors are in negative territory for the year. The worst among them, energy, has shed 19% so far in 2020—reflecting investors' fears that a slowdown in global economic activity will drag oil prices lower.
"I just don't think we can accept the numbers coming out of China at face value," said Mark Grant, managing director and chief global strategist at B. Riley FBR.
With little clarity on the severity of the epidemic, as well as uncertainty about if officials will be able to effectively contain it, Mr. Grant said he wouldn't be surprised if there was further volatility across markets.
Investors had largely begun the year with hopes that the global economy would stabilize given a cooling of trade tensions between the U.S. and China and central banks' willingness to hold interest rates at low levels.
But the coronavirus epidemic is throwing into question many firms' projections for growth, raising the possibility of a longer-term disruption to economic activity.
The head of the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday that the fund was downgrading its global-growth projections , as well as trying to figure out if the economic fallout stemming from the epidemic would primarily occur in the first quarter of the year.
Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 ended down 1.8%, closing out its worst four-day stretch since 2016, after having fallen more than 3% Monday.
China's Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.6%, while Japan's Nikkei Stock Average, which was closed Monday, fell 3.3%.
"This virus doesn't respect borders. There's no real reason to expect it's going to be easy to contain," said Jan Lambregts, global head of financial markets research at Rabobank. "The real economic impact of this is going to be felt."

The World Health Organization said Monday it isn't yet clear whether the coronavirus can be stopped from spreading further globally, as growing outbreaks in Italy, South Korea and Iran heightened concerns.
Italy reported a seventh death from the virus, with authorities imposing quarantines and other restrictions in the country's economic heartland to fight what is now the world's third-biggest national outbreak after those in China and Korea.
The 229 cases in Italy show how even the most proactive countries are at risk. Italy declared a state of emergency on Jan. 31 and banned all flights to and from China -- the only European Union country to do so.
South Korea reported 893 confirmed cases and eight deaths as of Tuesday morning. That was up from 763 cases a day earlier and a roughly 30-fold increase from a week ago. Tens of thousands of other people have been quarantined.
In the hard-hit city of Daegu, South Korea, hospitals warned that they don't have enough doctors, nurses and medical investigators to keep up with the constant stream of infected and at-risk patients. Government measures aimed at reducing infection, like discarding bedsheets and blankets after a single use, have depleted critical supplies. Employees are quitting as their families beg them to resign.
"We can't last long like this. All medical staff will burn out," said Nam Sung-il, a doctor treating patients at two Daegu hospitals. Space is so scarce at one of them, Dr. Nam said, that nurses have nowhere to rest but on the floor.
U.S. and South Korean military officials are considering curtailing a joint training exercise because of coronavirus, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and his South Korean counterpart said Monday.
In Iran, the death toll rose to at least 12, with 61 cases confirmed, Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi said. Iranian authorities said the outbreak's epicenter was Qom, one of the country's main pilgrimage sites.
The large outbreaks outside China suggests that the epidemic has reached a tipping point in which global spread of the virus is inevitable, some infectious-disease experts said.
"I don't think it can be contained at this point," said Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
The WHO said it isn't yet clear whether a world-wide spread is inevitable. The virus could be contained, develop a regular pattern of continual or seasonal transmission, or become a pandemic, said Michael Ryan, the WHO's chief of health emergencies, speaking at a news conference.
The agency said the outbreak doesn't currently qualify as a pandemic -- defined as widespread transmission on multiple continents, with impacts on society -- and new cases are on the decline in China, where the majority of illnesses have occurred.
The WHO said Monday, before South Korea updated its numbers, that there are 79,331 confirmed cases in 28 countries of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, including 2,618 deaths.
"We are encouraged by the continued decline in [new] cases in China," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director-general, said at the news conference. "The key message that should give all countries hope, courage and confidence is that this virus can be contained."
A team of international experts, led by the WHO, who have been in China over the past week concluded that the epidemic there peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2, and the number of new cases has been declining daily since then, Dr. Tedros said.
For example, China reported 2,590 new cases Feb. 2, and 415 new cases Feb. 24, according to WHO situation reports.
The WHO team found that "the measures taken in China have averted a significant number of cases," he added. "For the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or death."
Still, Dr. Tedros said, the new coronavirus "absolutely" has the power to become a pandemic. He said the growing number of cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea is "deeply concerning" and urged other countries to prepare for outbreaks.
Yet many countries may not be ready to identify symptoms that can easily be mistaken for the flu, the WHO and infectious-disease experts said. Tests for the virus aren't in widespread use, even in countries with advanced public health systems like the U.S. Hospitals may not be able to handle an influx of critically ill patients.
"We believe that all countries are vulnerable," said Dr. Ryan. All nations have older people who are at higher risk for severe illness from the virus, he said.
Italian authorities on Monday shut schools, universities and museums across the country's north, and banned gatherings, including soccer matches and cultural events. In Milan, the famed La Scala opera house was closed. Venice ended its annual carnival early. Catholic Church leaders announced the suspension of Masses.
Most of the people confirmed infected in Italy are in the wealthy region of Lombardy, concentrated in an area south of Milan. In 11 towns at the center of the outbreak -- 10 of them in Lombardy with a combined population of 50,000 -- residents are banned from leaving the area. The virus also spread to other northern regions, prompting authorities to ban or restrict activities in an attempt to limit infections. The regions affected by restrictions are home to around 27 million people.
Inside the quarantined region, streets were deserted and most people remained in their homes, according to residents.
"Looking out my window I haven't seen a single person or car all morning," said Claudia Ferrari, who lives in Codogno, one of the quarantined towns.
In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the immediate risk to the U.S. public from the virus remains low. The U.S. has quarantined Americans returning home from outbreak zones, and banned foreign nationals who have recently visited China from entering the U.S.
The Trump administration is asking Congress to approve roughly $1.8 billion to fight the virus and seeking the flexibility to spend as much as $2.5 billion. The money would go toward developing a vaccine and stockpiling protective gear, among other efforts, according to a copy of the request sent to Capitol Hill that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal.
President Trump said Monday on Twitter that the virus was "very much under control in the USA."

Virus Fears Bruise World Stocks --- Investors seek safety in gold, Treasurys, as the epidemic worsens in China and beyond

Investors around the world retreated from stocks and piled into haven assets including government bonds and gold, reflecting escalating worries that the coronavirus will disrupt the global economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points -- its biggest point decline in more than two years; the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note approached a record low; and gold prices climbed for the eighth straight session to a seven-year high.
Shares of travel, health insurers and highflying technology stocks were among the hardest hit. American Airlines Group dropped 8.5%, UnitedHealth Group slumped 7.8% and Facebook fell 4.5%. Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. dropped by more than 4%. And popular momentum stock Tesla Inc. declined more than 7%.
U.S. stocks had been relatively resilient in the wake of the epidemic. But a surge of cases outside China that was reported over the weekend rattled investors, prompting concerns about new pockets of infection in Italy, Iran and South Korea. Global health officials said on Monday that the number of cases world-wide has surpassed 79,000. More than 2,000 have been confirmed outside of China.
The epidemic, which has curtailed Chinese manufacturing, exports and consumption this year, is threatening to damp global growth as factories world-wide depend on a supply chain tethered to China. Officials and economists are warning that an extended Chinese shutdown could cripple global manufacturing and cost the world up to $1 trillion in lost output.
"With the developments we saw over the weekend -- more cases, more people getting sick without coming into contact with people from China -- I think it's opened the eyes of the investment community and it opened the eyes of the World Health Organization," said Carter Henderson, a portfolio manager at Pittsburgh-based Fort Pitt Capital Group.
"We don't know how or why this virus is spreading," Mr. Henderson said.
The blue-chip index fell 1,031.61 points, or 3.6%, to 27960.80, only the third 1,000-point drop in its history. The S&P 500 dropped 111.86 points, or 3.4%, to 3225.89, with all 11 sectors posting declines. Both indexes lost their gains for 2020.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite suffered the steepest losses, retreating 355.31 points, or 3.7%, to 9221.28, as investors dumped some of the momentum shares that have powered the long-running rally in U.S. stocks. The index is hanging on to a 2.8% gain for the year.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq had set records as recently as last Wednesday but have dropped 4.7% and 6.1%, respectively, over the past three sessions. The Dow industrials are off 5.4% from their Feb. 12 record.
The U.S. selloff followed sharp declines overseas.
Germany's DAX, the benchmark for Europe's industrial powerhouse, dropped 4%.
In South Korea, the benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index, or Kospi, closed down 3.9%. Early Tuesday the Kospi was up 0.8%, Japan's Nikkei was down 3% and the Shanghai Composite was down 1.6%.
Even now in the midst of the epidemic, few economists have called for an imminent recession in the U.S.
Plus, many investors are hesitant to pull out of the stock market after a decadelong bull run that has encountered a number of obstacles -- among them a trade war, a currency crisis in Europe and a slowdown in global growth -- only to resume its upward march.
The Federal Reserve's three interest-rate cuts last year boosted faith that the central bank will step in, if needed, to support the economy. Federal-funds futures used by traders to place bets on interest-rate policy show a 85% chance the Fed will lower rates at least once by the end of July, up from 39% a month ago.
Energy and technology stocks posted the biggest declines in the S&P 500 on Monday, both falling more than 4%. Oil company Hess slid 6.5% as Brent crude dropped 3.8% to $56.30 a barrel. Graphics-chip maker Advanced Micro Devices fell 7.8%.
Airlines and travel-related stocks were hit particularly hard. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings dropped 9.3% and Booking Holdings, the operator of Priceline and Kayak, declined 7.1%.
The flight from stocks coincided with a rush into haven assets. Gold prices rose 1.7% to $1,672.40 a troy ounce, the highest level since Feb. 6, 2013. Increased demand for U.S. government bonds sent the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note down to 1.377%, approaching the 2016 all-time closing low of 1.364%, according to Tradeweb.
"The rally of haven assets such as gold reflects surging demand for safety during a time of uncertainty," said CMC Markets analyst Margaret Yang. "Things will probably get worse before it gets better."
Volatility also returned in force to the stock market. The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, jumped to 25.03, its highest level since Jan. 3, 2019.
The options-based gauge tends to rise when markets fall and investors reach for insurance-like contracts to protect their portfolios.
Portfolio managers and investors on Monday suggested that investors may have originally been too sanguine about the health of financial markets, buoyed in part by positive consumer data and the trade deal reached between the U.S. and China in January.
Corporate earnings largely beat expectations, too, even as the coronavirus was raised as a topic of concern on dozens of recent conference calls with analysts. For weeks, however, it appeared that the virus was mostly contained within China's borders.
Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Charlotte, N.C.-based Independent Advisor Alliance, said Monday that it was "unrealistic to think that the virus would remain contained."
And as reports emerged of a rapidly growing number of coronavirus cases in Italy, South Korea and Iran over the weekend, economists said many investors are beginning to worry: Will another country and economy look like China in the coming weeks? "The markets are starting to fear that Europe is where China was at the end of December," said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, referring to early reports of illnesses in Wuhan at the end of 2019.

She tells U.S., California to answer questions of Costa Mesa residents
A federal judge on Monday directed federal and state officials to answer the questions of Costa Mesa, Calif., residents about their plans to bring Americans who have tested positive for the coronavirus but show no signs of illness to a closed mental-health facility in the city.
District Judge Josephine Staton cautioned that the city " and Orange County if it joins the effort " does not have veto power over state and federal quarantine decisions and faces an uphill battle trying to block the transfer of people from Travis Air Force Base in Northern California.
She said she would not make a decision in the city's lawsuit based on people's fears, but was also critical of state and federal officials for not doing more to allay people's concerns. She urged them to answer residents' questions about who would care for people who tested positive or were potentially exposed to the virus, how many quarantined individuals might be moved to Costa Mesa and what would happen if they developed symptoms and required hospitalization.
'When decisions are made in a hurry, mistakes are made,' she said, summoning the parties back to her courtroom on March-2 for a ruling. 
Costa Mesa and Anniston, Ala., are the first U.S. communities that have sought to block plans to transfer Americans repatriated from Asia and now in federal quarantine to facilities in their midst. While Costa Mesa won a preliminary injunction Friday to temporarily block the transfer, top-ranking Alabama officials " including Gov. Kay Ivey (R), U.S. Rep. Mike D. Rogers (R) and U.S. Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R) " took their case directly to President Trump and apparently won an assurance that the administration would not move forward with its plans there.
The efforts by the two communities reflect growing anxiety about the risks of the coronavirus outbreak for communities in the United States, and suggest that federal officials may have difficulty housing quarantined people as the number of confirmed cases in the nation has grown to more than 50.
The count jumped after the State Department and a top health official overruled the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and brought back more than 300 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, including 14 who had tested positive for the virus. Passengers on that ship are at high risk of contracting the virus because of their exposure in a confined space to those who may have been infected. 
Officials in both Costa Mesa and Anniston have expressed compassion for people exposed to the virus, but argued that housing them in facilities in residential communities could pose risks to residents. Mary Cahill, a retired teacher and resident of Santa Ana, which neighbors Costa Mesa, said that 'compassion does not equal negligence.' 
Jennifer Keller, a lawyer for Costa Mesa, spoke to the fears of many in the audience at the court hearing when she said, 'So little is known about this illness.' Keller reminded the judge that tourism in Orange County, home of Disneyland, is 'massive' and that a coronavirus outbreak could devastate the economy.
Local officials also said they did not receive clear communication from the federal government that their facilities could be used to aid in the response. 
'We felt blindsided,' Andrea Marr, a member of the Costa Mesa City Council, said in an interview. 'People have an expectation that they at least get some answers, that they know what the plan is.' 
Costa Mesa argued in its lawsuit that federal and state authorities did not coordinate with local officials before deciding they would transfer people who had tested positive for the virus to the Fairview Developmental Center, which they described as a 'dilapidated' complex unable to handle infectious-disease patients. 
City officials also said they received conflicting information from state health officials about the medical status of the people in question, the amount of time they would need to be quarantined and how various scenarios would be handled. 
In its response to the lawsuit, the state of California said that it was 'frivolous' and that the state's quarantine laws enabled it to identify state properties that could house quarantined residents.
Legal experts said it was unlikely that Costa Mesa's lawsuit would succeed because cities typically cannot override the decisions of a state government. 
'The question in the court is, can a city object to what a state government does?' said Polly Price, professor of law and global health at Emory University. 'Federal courts are pretty clear you can't sue a state government in court. There isn't really a federal order to challenge here because the key fact was that California's state public health department . . . they're in complete control.' 
In its response to Costa Mesa's lawsuit, the federal government argued that it was based on 'speculation and unfounded internet fear " not science, facts, or accepted health practice.' 
'Time is of the essence in this response to the public health emergency presented by COVID-19: this public health response requires action in hours and days, not days and weeks,' the government wrote. 'Any act that hinders the ability of federal and state public health authorities to implement these effective, time-tested measures endangers the public health " and, thus, the safety and well-being of the American people.' 
Yet local Costa Mesa officials and residents argued that the Fairview Developmental Center was in the middle of residential neighborhoods, and that children often use its fields for soccer practices, games and other events. 
Haverly Horton, a city resident whose 10-year-old son has a primary immunodeficiency, said she worries that Fairview is not a secure facility and that the virus could easily spread to vulnerable people like her son.
'I'd love for them to show us a plan and how they're going to enforce it,' Horton said. 'I don't want to be a NIMBY, but I don't want to be someone who's super liberal and say let's bring everybody in here and then my own son dies because I'm foolish.'

Spread to democracies tests capacity to curtail freedoms

Parts of northern Italy on lockdown as cases surge-to more than 200 
ROME " Checkpoints block entry to a dozen towns across northern Italy. Milan's landmark cathedral and opera house lie empty. Venice's Carnival was ordered closed two days early. Schools are shuttered, soccer matches called off.
For much of the past month, the fight to contain the coronavirus has depended largely on China, whose authoritarian communist government has relied on high-tech surveillance and tight restrictions on the movements of hundreds of millions of people.
As the virus jumps to other parts of the world, the fight is entering a new phase, testing the extent to which democracies are able or willing to curtail freedoms and impose sustained restrictions of their own.
Italy, where confirmed cases jumped from a few to more than 200 in a matter of days and six people have died, has responded aggressively. Checkpoints outside hot-spot towns are allowing only those with special permission to enter or leave.
South Korea has avoided China-style bans on movement " asking, not ordering, residents of the hard-hit city of Daegu to stay indoors.
Hanging over such tactics is the question of how the people will respond if the measures persist for weeks or longer " particularly in Italy, where the fractious government is subject to constant second-guessing and the economy was teetering on recession before the virus erupted.
'I don't think it is wise to stop the whole of Italy for two or three months and put the economy on its knees for a problem that is big but not so big,' said Andrea Braga, 55, who owns a bar in Casalpusterlengo, a sealed-off town outside Milan. 
When the threat of the virus felt remote, democratic countries including the United States imposed controls on people returning from China. The city of Costa Mesa, Calif., won a court injunction last week blocking the transfer of up to 50 people in federal quarantine to a complex the city said was unsuitable for them.
Italy went a step further, banning flights to and from China. Now that the virus has gained a foothold in Europe, the focus has turned to the normally permeable borders within the continent, and authorities across the bloc are scrambling to prepare. 
If the virus expands across Italy, neighboring governments could face public pressure to back away from the continent's open-border ideals in the name of security. European officials in Brussels on Monday emphasized there was no plan to close borders.
The coronavirus could pop up elsewhere as it did in Italy: without much warning. Some infectious-disease analysts have speculated the virus was in Italy for weeks, carried by one or more people with negligible symptoms, before it was detected.
German officials said this month they had contained a cluster of cases. Health Minister Jens Spahn said Monday that the country is bracing for more infections. The coronavirus has 'arrived as an epidemic in Europe,' Spahn said. 'So we must expect it to spread to Germany.'
He said developments in Italy, where the chain of infection could no longer be traced, had changed his ministry's assessments.
Germany, has recorded 16 coronavirus infections, 14 of them linked to employees of a car parts manufacturer in the southern region of Bavaria. No new infections have been detected for more than two weeks.
Lothar Wieler, president of Germany's governmental agency responsible for disease control, said he expected the virus to spread.
'When it comes to Germany, it will not go through Germany like a hurricane within two weeks,' he said. 'It will hit different regions in succession.'
In Italy, the outbreak has come into view in a matter of days, with case numbers spiking almost hourly and the virus jumping from one northern region to the next. Most of the cases have been contained in Lombardy, in towns to the south of Milan, the country's economic hub. The neighboring region of Veneto has a smaller cluster.
Officials have described closing towns as a short-term 'sacrifice.' In a briefing Monday, Angelo Borrelli, Italy's head of civil protection, referenced the trope that Italians can be 'undisciplined' but said they can be 'very orderly' for the sake of a health crisis.
Italians trapped in the hot spots have voiced little opposition. Videos from inside those towns show largely deserted town centers, except for the occasional person walking a dog or venturing to a mini-market for groceries. One church, where a funeral was scheduled, allowed only family members inside.
'The atmosphere is pretty eerie,' said Fabrizio Senneca, a church employee in Codogno. 'We are trying not to let psychosis take hold. I have very little to do.' 
It was a sense of foreboding that made people willing to hunker down. Authorities say cases have popped up with no obvious connection to travelers from China or people already infected.
'As always in Italy, individual behaviors are hard to govern,' said Giovanni Orsina, the director of the school of government at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. 'But it feels to me like there is a willingness to compromise on freedom in the name of protection.'
Countries neighboring China have faced their own questions about how to safeguard themselves.
Japan is still debating the confinement of more than 3,700 people on board a cruise ship for two weeks in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus.
It was an attempt that critics say was unsuccessful " more than 700 people on the Diamond Princess ended up becoming infected " and unnecessary: The virus was already spreading in Japan.
It was also dangerous because it risked the lives of the many hundreds of elderly passengers. Critics say it was also morally questionable because crew members' lives were put at risk by forcing them to continue working without isolation from each other.
Three passengers in their 80s have died, and at least 129 crew members have contracted the virus.
'Quarantine means, in other words, restrictions of human rights for some period " in this case, 14 days,' said Norio Ohmagari, head of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine's Disease Control and Prevention Center in Japan and a government adviser on the crisis. 'I'm sure not all the Japanese people or the international community will agree with that, in terms of the consideration of human rights and human dignity.'
Shigeru Omi, head of the Japan Community Health-care Organization and a senior government adviser on the crisis, said officials were 'of course' sympathetic to the human rights of the crew. But he said they had to remain on board to serve the passengers.
Human rights also played a part in the decision to allow Japanese passengers to return home after their 14-day quarantine, Omi said.
While the United States and other countries have imposed an additional 14-day quarantine on people evacuated from the ship, Japan allowed its passengers to return to their homes if they tested negative for the virus.

MEDIANetflix to list most popular programs
Netflix, which has been tight-lipped about the popularity of its shows and movies, is taking another step toward transparency.
A new feature on the streaming service will show its top 10 most popular programs and movies, updated daily. Netflix has been testing the approach for about six months in Mexico and Britain, the company said on Monday.
'Members in both countries have found them useful, so we are now rolling them out to even more,' Cameron Johnson, who oversees product innovation at Netflix, said in a blog post.
The lists should make it easier for viewers to pick what to watch. While Netflix's algorithm is supposed to make it easy for customers to find shows, the dizzying array of choices is too much for some viewers. Customers often spend long stretches of time just deciding which movie or show to try.
Netflix, the world's largest streaming subscription service, has frustrated the TV and film industry by not revealing its viewership. Unlike traditional TV, Netflix doesn't make audience data available, and fans are often left wondering why a favorite show was canceled.

EMPLOYMENTWages rose in largest counties in 3rd quarter
Employment increased in about 80-percent of the largest U.S. counties in the third quarter of 2019 from a year earlier, and wages grew in 350 of 355, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
In the third quarter of 2019, average weekly wages for the nation rose to $1,093, a 3.6-percent increase from a year earlier.

A third regional Federal Reserve factory gauge picked up in February, adding to signs that manufacturing had been stabilizing before the coronavirus outbreak intensified beyond China.
The Dallas Fed's gauge of manufacturing in Texas signaled expansion for the first time in five months, rising to 1.2 from a reading of minus-0.2 in January, according to a report Monday. 
The report followed data last week from the Philadelphia Fed, which said that its business outlook gauge surged this month to a three-year high of 36.7 as orders and shipments gained. Also last week, the New York Fed said its measure of manufacturing in the state accelerated in February to 12.9, the highest level since May and also reflecting stronger readings on orders and shipments.

E*Trade, Apple, Walmart: Stocks That Defined the Week; Here are seven major companies whose stocks moved on the week's news

E*Trade Financial Corp.
The long-predicted M&A frenzy in the wealth management industry is here. Wall Street stalwart Morgan Stanley agreed to buy discount broker E*Trade in a $13 billion deal announced Thursday. The all-stock deal is the biggest takeover by a giant U.S. bank since the 2008 crisis. Earlier in the week, money manager Franklin Resources Inc. agreed to buy rival Legg Mason Inc. for $4.5 billion in cash . E*Trade shares soared 22% Thursday.
Apple Inc.
The coronavirus is rippling through the world's most valuable company. Apple said Monday it won't meet its revenue projections for the current quarter, as the coronavirus has limited iPhone production and curtailed demand in China. Apple's announcement is the most prominent example yet of the effects of the virus on global business and markets. Apple's dependency on China's manufacturing and consumer sectors makes the company vulnerable as the coronavirus outbreak paralyzes the country. The company said the situation in China is evolving, and it will provide more information when it holds its earnings call in April. Apple shares fell 1.8% Tuesday.
Walmart Inc.
Even the world's biggest retailer struggled to get shoppers to spend during the holiday season. Walmart executives said the critical period started strong around Thanksgiving but sales of toys, videogames and apparel softened in the weeks before Christmas. Chief Executive Doug McMillon said store sales suffered from a late Thanksgiving as well as some merchandising missteps, such as a lack of high-price, in-demand holiday toys and a glut of inexpensive clothes and seasonal attire. Meanwhile, Walmart's U.S. e-commerce sales rose 35% in the fourth quarter, boosted by online grocery orders. Shares rose 1.5% Tuesday.
Bed Bath &Beyond Inc.
The new CEO of Bed Bath &Beyond wants to eliminate "purchase paralysis." To do that, Mark Tritton wants to declutter stores, make aisles wider and stop piling merchandise up to the ceiling. The former Target Corp. executive laid out his vision for remaking the troubled retailer Tuesday. Mr. Tritton plans to trim inventory by more than 10% this year, part of a broader plan that calls for spending as much as $400 million on store remodels, technology upgrades and supply-chain improvements. He joined the struggling company in November after its top officials, including the founders, were ousted by an activist investor. Shares gained 5.4% Tuesday.
L Brands Inc.
Les Wexner is giving up control of Victoria's Secret. The 82-year-old billionaire behind the lingerie brand and Bath &Body Works agreed Thursday to sell a controlling stake in the Victoria's Secret chain to private-equity firm Sycamore Partners for $525 million. He also agreed to step down as chairman and chief executive of L Brands. His decision to part ways with Victoria's Secret is an admission that Mr. Wexner couldn't revive the fortunes of the troubled brand he built around shopping malls and sex appeal. The deal leaves the Victoria's Secret business as a separate private company, and L Brands will be reduced to running one chain: Bath &Body Works. L Brands shares fell 3.6% Thursday.
ViacomCBS Inc.
ViacomCBS has a tough year ahead. The company reported a loss in the quarter as Viacom completed its merger with CBS and said it is targeting $750 million in cost cuts for the year, increasing its guidance from $500 million. The company also unveiled its three main streaming plans that will compete with Netflix Inc. and others: a free ad-supported service called Pluto TV, an expanded version of CBS All Access, and a third service anchored by Showtime that will be the most expensive option. "We believe this strategy of free, broad pay and premium pay is where the market will go," Chief Executive Bob Bakish said. Shares plummeted 18% Thursday.
Wells Fargo &Co.
Wells Fargo has reached a settlement with the government over its long-running fake-account scandal. The nation's fourth-largest bank agreed Friday to pay $3 billion to settle investigations by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is a victory for Charles Scharf, the bank's new boss who was tasked with resolving the crisis. Regulators and prosecutors could still take action against individuals involved in the debacle, in which it became public in 2016 that an aggressive sales culture led employees to open millions of possibly fake accounts. Last month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency charged eight former Wells Fargo executives over the scandal, including the former CEO. Wells Fargo shares gained 0.8% Friday.

Monday Sunrise Briefing: Momentum builds for Bernie Sanders

ABSTRACT (ENGLISH) 
Catch me up on the weekend news: Sanders wins Nevada and sets sights on Super Tuesday. South Korea raises virus alert level, focuses on churches.

FULL TEXT
With Sen. Bernie Sanders’ decisive win Saturday in Nevada, attention now shifts to the primary in South Carolina - and Super Tuesday. The question of electability looms ever larger for Democrats: Can a self-declared democratic socialist beat President Trump in November? Senator Sanders is “too progressive” for most Americans, say competitors. “I ain’t a socialist. I’m not a plutocrat. I’m a Democrat," former Vice President Joe Biden told supporters Saturday. 
But some analysts see parallels between the Sanders campaign and the Trump 2016 campaign. You'll recall a host of moderate GOP rivals tried to block Trump’s rise, but were too splintered to be effective. The real-estate mogul has a core of ardent supporters, they argued, but he could never appeal to a broad enough swath of American voters to win. 
Campaigning in delegate-rich Texas this weekend, Mr. Sanders said he has "brought together a multigenerational, multiracial coalition” that’s “going to sweep this country." By some calculations, the race for the Democratic nomination could be all-but over on Super Tuesday if Mr. Sanders has a strong showing in the 14 states (including Texas) that vote on March 3.
2. South Korean churches emerged as a focal point of coronavirus concern this weekend. All 1,100 branches of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, seen as a messianic cult by mainstream Christian groups, were temporarily closed by the South Korean government. One branch of the Shincheonji church, in the city of Daegu, has emerged as the the biggest cluster of COVID-19 infections in the country. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the decision was “a fair and inevitable step” to protect the nation, adding there was “no intention to limit religious freedom.”  Also, 41 Roman Catholic churches suspended masses in South Korea after some members were diagnosed with the virus after a group of Catholics returned from a Holy Land trip to Israel.
In Europe, Italy closed off a dozen towns, cancelled soccer matches and closed schools, theater performances and Venice’s famed Carnival.
Look Ahead
Monday, Feb. 24
Namaste Trump: Amid trade tensions, President Donald Trump arrived in Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state of Gujarat. The two-day visit began with an event titled “Namaste Trump,” which loosely translates to “Greetings, Trump,” held at the world's largest cricket stadium. It mirrors a similar event in Houston, Texas, last September called "Hello Modi."
Justice revisited: The U.S. Supreme court hears oral arguments this week in several cases, including disputes over a pipeline near the Appalachian Trail, illegal immigration, and who pays for acts of foreign terrorism.
Tuesday, Feb. 25
Qualified to lead? Eight Democratic candidates debate again on Tuesday in South Carolina, before a primary vote Saturday. CBS News and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute are hosting the 8 p.m. E.T. event.
Friday, Feb. 28
Let's skip the primary: The Republican Party canceled the 2020 presidential primary vote, but President Trump holds a campaign rally in North Charleston, South Carolina.  In 2016, Trump got 54.9% of the South Carolina vote. Hillary Clinton received 40.7%.
Saturday, Feb. 29
Palmetto State primary: South Carolina voters make their selection for 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. This was supposed to be former Vice President Joe Biden’s political firewall, but the latest polls show Sen. Bernie Sanders closing fast. 
US-Taliban peace deal: If the one-week “reduction in violence” accord is fulfilled, Washington expects to sign a peace deal with the Taliban Saturday that allows US troops to leave Afghanistan. The official end to America's longest war would also start intra-Afghan negotiations between the country's various political factions.

Integrity Watch
As a cab driver, Rajbir Singh knows what it means to go the extra mile. Two weeks ago, a 92-year-old woman wanted a ride to her bank. She had to withdraw $25,000 to pay off an IRS debt. Mr. Singh smelled something fishy. She agreed to give him the phone number of the “IRS agent” but the “agent” wouldn’t answer questions and hung up. Mr. Singh's passenger still wanted to pay her IRS debt. That’s when "Raj pleaded with the woman to reconsider so they agreed to stop by the Roseville Police Station to ask an officer," according to a Facebook post by Roseville police. A cop confirmed the scam. In fact, it’s so common that the IRS has a web page on how to spot this ripoff. 
Kudos to Mr. Singh’s for taking the time to look out for his “neighbor.” "I am an honest guy, and these are old people. They need help," Mr. Singh, the owner of Roseville Cab, told CNN "It just made sense."

Risky investments have rallied this year. So have safe ones.
The tug of war across financial markets shows just how divided the outlook among investors is as they struggle to assess the economic toll of the growing coronavirus epidemic.
Within the stock market, the two best-performing sectors in the S&P 500 in 2020 have been technology and utilities. That is notable because the two groups often move in opposite directions -- with technology stocks rallying when investors feel confident in taking on riskier investments, and utilities and other safety stocks typically doing their best when money managers feel most skittish about economic prospects.
The S&P 500 tech sector is up 8.2% for the year, while utilities have risen 8.3%. Both groups have significantly outperformed the broader index, which has climbed 3.3% in 2020.
"It's a really polarized market," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Holdings.
Even as the S&P 500 hangs within a few percentage points of its record high, "we have all of this money plowing into harbors of safety," he said.
Money managers and analysts had begun the year relatively optimistic about the global economy.
Risky assets like stocks had even been relatively resilient through some spurts of selling related to the coronavirus epidemic, with analysts attributing the calm to investors' faith that the disease would be contained and that central banks would deploy enough stimulus to help offset a temporary pullback in growth.
In recent days, that confidence has shown signs of faltering -- with defensive parts of the stock market, as well as the price of other havens like gold and U.S. Treasurys racing higher.
The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury slipped to a record Friday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.
Gold, meanwhile, jumped 1.7%, ending at its highest level since February 2013.
Analysts have attributed the moves to fears that the coronavirus epidemic will disrupt consumer spending, manufacturing and supply chains around the world more than investors had expected.
Many firms' initial estimates of the epidemic's impact on growth had assumed that the disease would be contained within the first couple of months of the year. But in recent weeks, reports have shown the number of cases continuing to jump around the world, and multinationals like Apple Inc. have warned that their sales would take a hit because of a pullback in consumer spending.
With that kind of dim outlook, investors might typically retreat from risky assets overall. But faith that U.S. multinationals -- particularly big tech companies -- are resilient enough to withstand a temporary slowdown in global growth has helped keep those shares higher.
Even with Friday's pullback, Netflix Inc. is up 17% for the year. Alphabet Inc. has risen 11%, while Microsoft Corp. is up 13%.
It is difficult to imagine the disconnect being sustainable for long, Mr. Hogan said.
"Are we really pricing in recession fears? Or are people just so nervous they'll pay for anything with yield?" he said.

Global Economy Shows Strain As Virus Starts to Take a Toll

HONG KONG -- The last time a coronavirus outbreak hit China in 2003, the global economy emerged relatively unscathed. Now, nearly two decades later, the growth-damping effects of a similar pathogen threaten to ripple around a world transformed by China's boom.
Chinese consumption and production power growth from Asia to North America, Europe and beyond. Manufacturers world-wide are tethered to China by the tentacles of a supply chain that relies on the country's factories for many intermediate and finished goods.
With fears of contagion keeping Chinese workers home, production is getting pinched. In the U.S., General Motors Co. unions have warned that a lack of China-made parts could slow assembly lines at sport-utility vehicle plants in Michigan and Texas; the company said it is working to mitigate the risk.
Elsewhere, the story is the same -- even in places that might seem remote.
Mostafiz Uddin, a blue jeans manufacturer in the southeastern Bangladeshi city of Chittagong, said he has been unable to fulfill an order for 100,000 women's jeans because he can't get the fabric he needs from China. "I am just waiting," he said. "We have no option."
A month after the epidemic forced factories into limbo past their usual Lunar New Year break -- a handful are reopening -- officials and economists are warning that an extended Chinese shutdown could cripple global manufacturing and cost the world up to $1 trillion in lost output.
"The current situation is more serious than we thought," South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday. "We need to take emergency steps in this time of emergency."
Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 major economies on Sunday warned in Riyadh that the corona virus posed a serious risk to global growth and agreed to take action should its impact intensify.
Over the weekend, the International Monetary Fund cut China's annual growth by 0.4 percentage point, to 5.6%, compared with the fund's previrus prediction in January. The slower growth would shave 0.1 percentage point of global output, the fund said as it updated its forecasts, though the Chinese economy would likely recover in the second quarter.
"This is a human tragedy, but it also has negative economic impact," IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said at the summit.
Hyundai Motor Co., after shutting some of its Chinese factories this month, suspended one of its main assembly lines in Ulsan, a big South Korean city, because it couldn't get parts from China. Asiana Airlines Inc., South Korea's second-largest airline, put its 10,500 employees on staggered shifts of 10 days' unpaid leave from Wednesday.
Major electronics producers that depend on Chinese parts have suspended output because of the outbreak. Others are weighing relocation. Japan's exports to China are expected to drop 7% this quarter from the prior one, NLI Research Institute economist Taro Saito said. Videogame giant Nintendo Co. said this month that some shipments of its flagship Switch gaming console are delayed as it can't get parts from Chinese factories.
Piling onto two years of China-U.S. trade tensions, the impact of the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,000 people in China, could be severe. Countries most reliant on China could see more than half a percentage point wiped off their gross domestic product this year, some economists say.
China now accounts for nearly a third of world GDP growth, up from around 3% in 2000. Between 2000 and 2017, the world's economic exposure to China tripled, according to estimates by the McKinsey Global Institute.
That rising dependence weighs most heavily on Asia. In 2000, China accounted for just 1.2% of global trade, said the World Bank. Its share was one-third in 2018. In Asia, that measure went from 16% to 41% during the period.
The impact is felt everywhere. Apple Inc. said it won't meet revenue projections for the first quarter as the epidemic shuts its China plants. In Europe, container-ship operators are preparing profit warnings as dozens of trips out of China are canceled.
A U.S. freeze on visitors from China is a blow to hotels and retailers that rely on their spending. Asian economies that have grown dependent on Chinese visitors and commerce are reeling. Singapore last week cut its annual GDP forecast to around 0.5%, down from 1.5%. Thailand estimates tourist arrivals could drop by 13% this year as Chinese are grounded. In Vietnam, a small economy highly dependent on Chinese supply chains, exports in January fell 17.4% year-to-year to their second-lowest level since the U.S.-China trade war began, official data showed. Imports were down 13.7%, led by a 16% plunge in those from China.
From steel to furniture, Vietnam built much of its economy on importing semifinished material from China, then exporting the finished products to developed economies such as the U.S. Now, over 50% of manufacturers are experiencing difficulty sourcing supplies because of disruptions from the virus, the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam said last week.
Australia, with an economy six times as large as Vietnam's, is also feeling the effects. Two decades ago, China was a relatively peripheral trading partner, trailing the U.S., Japan and Korea as export destinations. But as Beijing massively invested in industry, China's enormous hunger sucked up ever larger shipments of iron ore and coal from the continent. Last year, China accounted for nearly 40% of Australia's exports.
Australia's BHP Billiton Ltd., the world's largest miner, said it expects to revise its expectations for commodity-demand growth downward if the epidemic isn't contained by the end of March.
The downturn has spilled over to ancillary industries. Sydney-based WiseTech Global Ltd., which provides cloud-based software to track products, downgraded its 2020 earnings forecast on Wednesday, saying China's shutdown had forced a delay of new product features it had hoped would lift revenue.
"This is a once-in-a-generation event," Chief Executive Richard White said.

World News: Iran Election Gives Boost to Hard-Liners --- Low turnout mars conservative effort to show widespread popular backing

TEHRAN -- Iran's conservatives won in a landslide in the country's parliamentary elections, strengthening hard-liners opposed to diplomacy with the West. But a record-low turnout dealt a public rebuke to the establishment's call for unity in the face of escalating tensions with the U.S.
Acknowledging the defeat of nonconservative factions, the moderate President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday called on the new lawmakers to represent not just those who voted but all Iranians.
"Regardless of the result and political inclinations of those elected, we thank the people for the sake of their presence," Mr. Rouhani said, according to the IRNA state news agency.
Conservative factions won 221 of the 290 seats in Iran's legislative assembly, up from 83 in the last elections in 2016, according to Icana, the parliament's news service. Reformists and moderates lost out, as their tally dropped to 20 seats from 121 in the last elections, after thousands of their candidates were disqualified. Independents won 38 seats, while the share of seats won by women remained unchanged at 17, Icana said.
The results weren't a clear-cut victory for the conservative establishment. Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli told state media Sunday that Friday's elections saw a turnout of 43%, down from 62% in the 2016 vote and the lowest in the Islamic Republic's history.
Iran's establishment had attempted to secure a strong turnout, which would have provided a measure of legitimacy amid popular unrest at home over its handling of an economy battered by U.S. sanctions.
The mass disqualification of moderate and reformist candidates and attempts by the leadership to cover up its role in shooting down a Ukrainian airliner prompted calls to boycott Friday's election.
An outbreak of the coronavirus in Iran also likely kept some people away from polling stations. Iran's health ministry on Sunday confirmed the eighth coronavirus-related death in the country, among 43 confirmed cases. In the central city of Qom, the source of the outbreak and a bastion of the conservative establishment, only 43% of registered voters cast ballots.
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on Sunday accused foreign powers of using the virus in their propaganda to discourage Iranians from voting in an attempt to undermine the Islamic Republic.
Expressing "deep appreciation" for the Iranians who voted, Mr. Khamenei said Iran's election "negates the enemy's claim that religion is against democracy and freedom.
"This negative propaganda started from months before the elections and increased as the elections approached. And in the last two days, with the pretext of a disease and virus, their media didn't miss a chance to dissuade people from taking part in the elections," he said, according to state television.
For decades, elections have been an important tool for the Iranian state to portray legitimacy domestically and abroad. A poor turnout will be widely seen as a snub against the leadership but won't materially impact its ability to govern as it sees fit, or to crack down on popular dissent.
The conservative victory cements a monthslong rise of factions that have been opposed to Mr. Rouhani's attempts to open Iran up and strengthen its engagement with Western countries, particularly with the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal.
Their rise has been fueled in part by the Trump administration's campaign of maximum pressure on Tehran. The U.S. withdrew from the nuclear accord in 2018 and reimposed harsh economic sanctions on Iran in an attempt to coerce Iran to negotiate a new nuclear deal and roll back its military influence in the Middle East.
The U.S. also killed Iran's most prominent military commander, Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, in Iraq in January.
The Iranian parliament's powers are limited, as the supreme leader has the final say on all matters of religion and state, including foreign policy. But lawmakers ratify international treaties, pass national laws and can pressure the government by impeaching ministers.
Even with a larger share of moderates and reformists, the departing parliament posed great challenges to Mr. Rouhani. Most recently, a global antiterror-financing body blacklisted Iran for its failure to pass anti-money-laundering legislation, due to resistance in parliament to the government's efforts to push it through.

World News: Fear Grips South Korea Amid Mounting Cases

DAEGU, South Korea -- Cafes here demanded orders must be takeout or delivery. A typically bustling market hollowed out. The rare flicker of activity occurred at stores selling face masks, though most had run out.
These are the scenes of eerie silence unfolding in Daegu, South Korea's fourth-largest city and an epicenter for a coronavirus outbreak that skyrocketed to 763 cases on Monday morning -- a roughly 25-fold rise in just five days. In response, President Moon Jae-in raised the country's virus-alert system to the highest of four levels, calling it a severe situation that requires "unprecedented, powerful" measures.
South Korea, confronted with the highest coronavirus count outside China, is granted broader authority by going to the maximum red level. The government can implement containment policies that restrict domestic travel and block public activities. It also pushed back the start of the school year by a week, to March 9.
The mobilization comes as South Korea reported its seventh death linked to the virus.
More than half of South Korea's infections have been linked to a Daegu location of a secretive megachurch, which the government recently referred to as a cult. Other recent cases included an employee at a Samsung Electronics Co. smartphone facility near Daegu, which was closed through Monday morning.
The U.S. State Department raised its travel advisory for South Korea -- placing it at the second of four levels -- and warned travelers to "exercise increased caution." On Saturday, Israel blocked the entry of hundreds of South Korean tourists, drawing a protest from the Foreign Ministry in Seoul.
Since the start of the local outbreak traced back to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu, this southeastern city of 2.4 million people has ground to a halt. The mayor has told people to stay indoors and avoid large gatherings. U.S. soldiers stationed in Daegu aren't allowed to visit off-base establishments. South Korea's military base is on a virtual lockdown.
Shincheonji's eight-story church building remained closed after services were canceled there, as well as at more than 70 other locations across the country. Yellow-vested city officials sprayed disinfectant on the exterior of the church building. Shincheonji -- which means "new heaven and earth" in Korean -- on Sunday said it had shut its facilities and is doing everything in its power to reach its members.
Normally, around 8,000 to 9,000 people attend Sunday services at the Daegu church, former members said. They said worshipers typically kneel close together at services and don't wear face masks, attending even when showing symptoms of illness.
As the church's role in the outbreak became public, South Korean officials struggled to contact Shincheonji members after the distribution of a member's text message imploring others to stay quiet. Shincheonji has said the message had been sent without the church's approval.
"Our church members are citizens of South Korea and the greatest victims of the virus," a Shincheonji spokesman said. The group has also called the coronavirus epidemic the work of Satan.
The link between church members and the outbreak in Daegu has angered some residents. "They could still be walking around the streets of Daegu, and officials haven't been able to track all of them down," said Kwon Oh-young, a 70-year-old taxi driver who has lived in the city for four decades.
Daegu's largest marketplace, the Seomun Market, which is filled with fresh-fish merchants and clothing stores, was temporarily shut on Sunday for disinfection. After the market reopens, it will be short of government-provided protective supplies, having received just 1,780 masks and 1,950 containers of hand sanitizer, said Kim Young-oh, president of the Daegu Merchant Association. That is insufficient for a market with 20,000 merchants, he added. On Sunday, the mayor of Daegu said the city would purchase one million masks from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to deal with supply problems.
"The city has been annihilated because of Shincheonji Church," Mr. Kim said.
Elsewhere in Daegu, coronavirus fears have disrupted everyday life.
The busiest shopping street in Daegu, called Dongseongno, was desolate, as residents heeded the mayor's order to stay home. Many shops were temporarily shut because of the virus. Signs at convenience stores along the street read: "Masks sold out."

Wall Street Journal's China staff protests the newspaper's 'sick man' headline

The Wall Street Journal's China staff is urging the newspaper to apologize for a headline that prompted the Chinese government to expel three of its journalists last week.
The email from the Journal's China bureau to the top officers of the paper's parent companies, in effect, sides with the Chinese, who have demanded an apology and retaliated with the expulsions last week.
The headline in question " 'China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia' " appeared on an opinion column written by academic and foreign affairs specialist Walter Russell Mead in the Journal on Feb. 3. The column was a commentary on the health of China's financial markets, rather than a reference to the coronavirus outbreak there.
Chinese officials and ordinary citizens have protested that 'sick man' is a racist phrase once used by Westerners to denigrate China during and immediately after the era in which colonial powers dominated and exploited the nation. 
The protests led the government on Wednesday to revoke the press credentials of three Journal reporters, giving them five days to leave the country in the largest such action against Western journalists since 1989.
The Journal has expressed 'regret' over the headline but has not apologized or amended it.
'We . . . ask you to consider correcting the headline and apologizing to our readers, sources, colleagues and anyone else who was offended by it,' said an email sent on behalf of Journal employees by Jonathan Cheng, the Journal's bureau chief in Beijing, to William Lewis, the Journal's publisher and chief executive of Dow Jones - Co., and Lewis's boss, Robert Thomson, the chief executive of News Corp.
The email added, 'This is not about editorial independence or the sanctity of the divide between news and opinion. It is not about the content of Dr. Mead's article. It is about the mistaken choice of a headline that was deeply offensive to many people, not just in China.
'We find the argument that no offense was intended to be unconvincing: Someone should have known that it would cause widespread offense. If they didn't know that, they made a bad mistake, and should correct it and apologize.' 
The email, sent Thursday, was signed by 53 members of the Journal's China staff and 'other colleagues involved in our coverage,' it said. Cheng was not among its signatories but sent a separate email endorsing the staff's stance.
In a separate email, also obtained by The Washington Post, Cheng told the two senior executives that their 'proper handling of this matter is essential to the future of our presence in China.'
Journal spokesman Steve Severinghaus indicated Saturday that the Journal's position has not changed. 
'We understand the extreme challenges our employees and their families are facing in China,' he said in a statement. '. . . The experience of working through coronavirus and the expulsion of close colleagues is in credibly difficult, and we have encouraged open conversations about their concerns so that we can offer support.'
He added, 'Dow Jones will continue to push for the unfair action against [the paper's journalists] to be reversed and for their visas to be reinstated.'
China has periodically punished Western journalists by denying them entry to the country or by not renewing their visas. But expulsions are rare. Until acting against the Journal this week, the government hadn't kicked out a credentialed journalist since 1998, according to the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China.
The government's action brought a rebuke from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said in a statement, 'Mature, responsible countries understand that a free press reports facts and expresses opinions. The correct response is to present counter arguments, not restrict speech.' Pompeo himself recently booted a reporter from NPR off his media plane in apparent retaliation for questions he didn't like in an earlier interview with another NPR journalist.
The staff-written email said the Journal has been attacked for weeks for the headline by Chinese state media and by ordinary people its reporters have met. The state-run Global Times, for example, called the headline 'racist' on Wednesday and demanded that the Journal apologize, as did a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
In a statement issued hours after the expulsions were announced, Lewis, the Journal's publisher, expressed regret but did not offer a formal apology. 'It was not our intention to cause offense with the headline on the piece,' he said. 'However, this has clearly caused upset and concern amongst the Chinese people, which we regret.'
Lewis said in his statement that 'the need for quality, trusted news reporting from China is greater than ever' and that the decision 'to target our News department journalists greatly hinders that effort.'
The Journal is owned by News Corp., whose executive chairman and principal shareholder is media baron Rupert Murdoch.
The controversy comes amid steadily rising tensions between the United States and China over media issues.
China moved against the Journal reporters a day after the Trump administration designated five major Chinese news organizations with U.S. operations as official government entities, effectively labeling them propaganda outlets for Beijing. The designation under the Foreign Missions Act means the organizations will be treated as though they are diplomatic outposts of the Chinese government and subject to the same constraints. 
The outlets include the official Xinhua News Agency; China Global Television Network; China Radio International; the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party of China; and the China Daily newspaper.
The latter entity produces English-language advertorial sections promoting China called 'China Watch' that are carried in American newspapers, including The Washington Post, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

TEHRAN—Iran's conservatives won a landslide in the country's parliamentary elections, strengthening hard-liners opposed to diplomacy with the West. But a record-low turnout dealt a public rebuke to the establishment's call for unity in the face of escalating tensions with the U.S.
Acknowledging the defeat of nonconservative factions, the moderate President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday called on the new lawmakers to represent not just those who voted but all Iranians.
"Regardless of the result and political inclinations of those elected, we thank the people for the sake of their presence," Mr. Rouhani said, according to the IRNA state news agency.
Conservative factions won 221 of the 290 seats in Iran's legislative assembly, up from 83 in the last elections in 2016, according to Icana, the parliament's news service. Reformists and moderates lost out, as their tally dropped to 20 seats from 121 in the last elections, after thousands of their candidates were disqualified. Independents won 38 seats, while the share of seats won by women remained unchanged at 17, Icana said.
The results weren't a clear-cut victory for the conservative establishment. Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli told state media Sunday that Friday's elections saw a turnout of 43%, down from 62% in the 2016 vote and the lowest in the Islamic Republic's history.
Iran's establishment had attempted to secure a strong turnout , which would have provided a measure of legitimacy amid popular unrest at home over its handling of an economy battered by U.S. sanctions.
The mass disqualification of moderate and reformist candidates and attempts by the leadership to cover up its role in shooting down a Ukrainian airliner prompted calls to boycott Friday's election.
An outbreak of the coronavirus in Iran also likely kept some people away from the polling stations. Iran's health ministry on Sunday confirmed the eighth coronavirus-related death in the country, among 43 confirmed cases. In the central city of Qom, the source of the outbreak and a bastion of the conservative establishment, only 43% of registered voters cast ballots.
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on Sunday accused foreign powers of using the virus in their propaganda to discourage Iranians from voting in an attempt to undermine the Islamic Republic.
Expressing "deep appreciation" for the Iranians who voted, Mr. Khamenei said Iran's election "negates the enemy's claim that religion is against democracy and freedom."
"This negative propaganda started from months before the elections and increased as the elections approached. And in the last two days, with the pretext of a disease and virus, their media didn't miss a chance to dissuade people from taking part in the elections," he said, according to state television.
For decades, elections have been an important tool for the Iranian state to portray legitimacy domestically and abroad. A poor turnout will be widely seen as a snub against the leadership but won't materially impact its ability to govern as it sees fit, or to crack down on popular dissent.
The conservative victory cements a monthslong rise of factions that have been opposed to Mr. Rouhani's attempts to open Iran up and strengthen its engagement with Western countries, particularly with the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal.
Their rise has been fueled in part by the Trump administration's campaign of maximum pressure on Tehran. The U.S. withdrew from the nuclear accord in 2018 and reimposed harsh economic sanctions on Iran in an attempt to coerce Iran to negotiate a new nuclear deal and roll back its military influence in the Middle East. The U.S. also killed Iran's most prominent military commander, Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, in Iraq in January.
The Iranian parliament's powers are limited, as the supreme leader has the final say on all matters of religion and state, including foreign policy. But lawmakers ratify international treaties, pass national laws and can pressure the government by impeaching ministers.
Even with a larger share of moderates and reformists, the outgoing parliament posed great challenges to Mr. Rouhani. Most recently, a global antiterror-financing body blacklisted Iran for its failure to pass anti-money-laundering legislation, due to resistance in parliament to the government's efforts to push it through. A parliament dominated by hard-liners will also be less likely to agree to a new nuclear deal with the U.S., which Washington has said it aims to achieve with its sanctions policy, and could push for Tehran to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
Notably, conservatives won all 30 seats in Tehran, according to state television, dealing a resounding blow to reformists and moderates who had won all seats in the capital in the 2016 elections.
The city of Tehran, which is the base of the country's most liberal and secular constituencies, saw the lowest voter turnout in the country, with 25.4%.
Mr. Fazli, the interior minister, said considering the conditions in the country, including the coronavirus outbreak, the plane crash and political unrest, the overall turnout was "completely acceptable."
Former Tehran Mayor Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf soared to the top of the conservative list in Tehran, positioning him, as expected, as the front-runner to become the next speaker of parliament, a position that comes with a seat on the Supreme National Security Council.
Mr. Qalibaf, a pragmatist conservative who has run for president twice, is a former military commander with strong ties to the Revolutionary Guard. His win illustrates the Guard's growing role over the past few years in Iranian politics.

Infections increase among cruise ship passengers evacuated to U.S.

Twenty-eight U.S. residents flown home from the Diamond Princess cruise ship are infected with coronavirus, and health officials expect to see more positive cases among the evacuated passengers in coming days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.
The passengers from the ship, along with three infected people previously returned from Wuhan, China, bring the total number of evacuees with the virus in the United States to 31. An additional 13 people in the United States either picked up the infection by traveling to China or from close contact with a family member who had been in China.
The passengers, who had been quarantined aboard the cruise ship in Japan, are 'considered at high risk of infection and we do expect to see additional cases,' Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a media briefing.
The sharp rise in the number of U.S. patients came on a day of grim news about the spread of covid-19, the viral respiratory disease that has afflicted more than 76,000 people and killed more than 2,200, mainly in China.
The number of cases in South Korea surged to 204, with about two-thirds linked to a secretive religious movement with a messianic leader. Iran confirmed 18 cases, including four deaths, centered in Qom, a Shiite holy city south of Tehran. In Beijing, two hospitals were put under quarantine amid fears of a coronavirus outbreak in China's capital, with one district reporting an 'infection density' second only to Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic.
Messonnier said 18 of the Americans who were quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess in Yokohama harbor had positive results in CDC tests. Ten others were positive in tests conducted by the Japanese. The CDC won't formally add those people to its count until U.S. tests confirm the findings, but Messonnier announced them Friday. 
The Japanese government quarantined 3,700 passengers and crew members aboard the Diamond Princess for nearly two weeks, a decision that allowed the virus to sweep through the ship, which one Japanese expert has said was plagued by poor infection control. Now, 624 of those onboard have tested positive " the second-largest number in any place outside China.
Last weekend, the State Department flew 329 U.S. residents home from the ship on two chartered flights. The Washington Post reported Thursday that the evacuation was delayed for hours by a last-minute disagreement among government officials. As the passengers arrived at the airport in buses, test results came back indicating 14 people waiting to evacuate were infected with coronavirus.
CDC officials did not want to put sick people on the plane with uninfected passengers, but they were overruled by the State Department and another top government health official.
At Friday's briefing, Ian Brownlee, principal deputy assistant secretary in the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, said the tests for those 14 people were conducted 48 to 72 hours before they boarded the buses, indicating they were infected on the ship.
A plane carrying 129 Canadians and their family members from the Diamond Princess also arrived in Canada on Friday. 
It's not clear where all the infected Americans are being treated. Eleven are receiving care at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Five are receiving care at hospitals around Travis Air Force Base near Sacramento, where one plane landed, and two are being treated near Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio, where the other flight arrived.
Dozens of other Americans from the cruise ship who tested positive were taken off the ship before the evacuation and are still in Japanese hospitals. They include Wayne and Susan Hidalgo of Kansas City, Kan., who wondered why the ship continued to allow people to mingle freely on board, even after a passenger on board was diagnosed with the virus. One of the people Wayne Hidalgo regularly dined with had shared a bus with the infected passenger.
'As time went on, after a day or so, I wondered, why are we eating dinner with these people? Why is everybody out dancing? Why are they having these shows going on?' the 77-year-old said in a telephone interview from his hospital bed in Tokyo. 
Japan's Health Ministry said 88 Americans aboard the ship have been diagnosed with covid-19. Most have been taken to hospitals on land. 
The Hidalgos' children want them brought home, arguing that it's 'not fair' they've been left in Japan while other Americans were evacuated. Wayne Hidalgo said he knows the couple can't leave until they are given the all-clear by Japanese doctors. They each need two consecutive negative tests.
Wayne Hidalgo said he is suffering from mild pneumonia and has been put on oxygen, but had only a fleeting fever. He's taking antibiotics, but doctors haven't felt it necessary to put him on anti-viral medication given to the most severely ill patients. Susan Hidalgo has no symptoms.
Wayne Hidalgo said he has become 'more and more confident' with the medical care he is receiving as time goes by, and is 'totally impressed' with his hospital, his doctor " who speaks fluent English " and nurses who are 'wonderful and funny.'
'Susan, my wife, and I have both accepted the fact that we've got to stay mentally healthy, and exercise some, and stay here,' he said.
An official from the U.S. Embassy has visited, bringing them clothes and local currency, while Princess Cruises, the cruise line that operates the ship, has been in contact every day.
On Feb. 1, a Diamond Princess passenger from Hong Kong, who had left the ship Jan.-25, was diagnosed with the virus. Princess Cruises said it learned about this on social media the next day and reached out to Hong Kong authorities. On Feb. 3, the captain told passengers the ship would wait in Yokohama while Japanese Health Ministry officials assessed the situation. But passengers still mingled, including at a buffet dinner on Feb.-4. It was only later they were told to stay in their cabins. 
John Haering, 63, from Tooele, Utah, said he came down with a fever that reached 103.6-degrees on Feb.-10, but was not seen by a doctor until 5-p.m. the following day. For 2 1/2 days, his wife, Melanie, put wet cloths on his forehead to keep him cool, replacing them every 20 minutes. 
He wasn't evacuated from the ship to a Tokyo hospital until Feb.-13. His fever had subsided by then. He has been in isolation ever since, with very little human contact. He takes his own temperature, and meals are passed through a stainless-steel cabinet with doors on two sides. Once a day, a nurse in full protective gear comes in to clean his room.
He said he has received just one phone call from the U.S. Embassy and no contact with Carnival Corp., the British-American company based in Doral, Fla., that owns Princess Cruises.
'I have, as my doctor described it, bad pneumonia. I'm fighting each day to stay positive and healthy,' he said. 'I don't need the uncertainty of what will happen to me weighing on my thoughts.'
In a statement, the U.S. State Department said 'the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad' is one of its highest priorities, including providing 'all appropriate consular assistance' to U.S. citizens remaining in Japan, and visiting those who have been hospitalized from the Diamond Princess.
But Haering said he needs much more information. 
'I'm worried and scared and frustrated with what I have seen and NOT heard so far,' he said in a statement.

As China fights virus, other patients languish

Overburdened hospitals turning away people with dire and chronic illnesses
BEIJING " Nie Mingtao arrived at Wuhan Union Hospital's tumor center on Feb. 9, hoping to continue with chemotherapy treatment for the late-stage lung cancer that had left him unable to eat or sleep.
When Nie arrived, paperwork in order, a doctor apologized and turned him away: The hospital was emptying its cancer ward to make room for patients suffering from the coronavirus that was ravaging Hubei province, said his son, Nie Wenjie.
A month into its battle to contain the outbreak, China is overseeing an unprecedented triage on a national level by scaling back or suspending public health services for patients with ailments unrelated to the epidemic.
Within Hubei province at the outbreak's epicenter, hospitals are so overwhelmed by the disease that they lack manpower or beds to treat hardly anything else. Beyond Hubei, hospitals from Chongqing in the southwest to Beijing in the north, in an all-out effort to minimize the chance of virus transmission, are choosing to shutter departments and reject patients seeking surgeries, kidney dialysis, diabetes medication and help for a variety of other conditions.
A United Nations program said this week that one-third of Chinese living with HIV say they are at risk of running out of antiretroviral medication and that many don't know how they can get their next refill.
'This is not right,' said Nie Wenjie, 28, this week from his rural village in northern Hubei as he watched his father heave and moan, his condition worsening. 'All the lives not touched by the coronavirus " are those lives not worth saving?'
As the outbreak's second-order effects ripple across China, the breakdown of the health system is posing a logistical and ethical challenge for the government. Chinese social media has been flooded by so many pleas under the hashtag '#NonPneumonia PatientSeekingHelp' that authorities this week began censoring posts. Although nationwide statistics are not available, families and networks of volunteers who monitor such cases say there are patients dying at home because they cannot access timely care.
Sacrificing some to save others
In phone conversations with The Washington Post, six families with sick relatives across China described their frustration as the country mobilizes a vast operation to combat an epidemic its leaders consider their public health and political priority. Some individuals asked that their names be withheld in full or in part for privacy reasons.
One western Hubei family was near collapse seeking aid for their week-old baby, whose blood disease case was being rejected by hospitals. A man from Inner Mongolia rented an apartment in Beijing and walked to a hospital every day for weeks to check if doctors would operate on his father's tumor. Another woman in the capital who was on the verge of kidney failure pleaded for help with operators on several city emergency hotlines, who said there were no facilities that could provide dialysis. She was admitted to a hospital Tuesday only after she aired her case online and volunteers came to her aid.
'I'm not saying there should be equal weight between epidemic patients and everyone else, but why not set aside a few more hospitals for non-fever patients?' said Nie Wenjie.
In an interview, Gordon Liu, a Peking University professor who serves on the Chinese National Health Commission's expert advisory committee on the novel coronavirus, said infection containment policies have 'lost balance.'
'To avoid 1 percent chance of infection, are we choosing 99 percent chance of so many people suffering?' Liu said. 'To create a situation that exacts a greater human cost than the virus itself " that would be the greatest regret of all.'
Hospitals, including in the United States, have been known to turn away people trying to visit patients during influenza outbreaks. Hospitals worldwide also seal off wards when transmissible diseases break out inside, such as during the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic in 2003. But public health experts say the phenomenon of hospitals across a country rejecting large numbers of patients as a precautionary measure is rare.
'I've never heard of this happening as a precaution,' said Eric Toner, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who has advised U.S. governments and hospitals on preparedness for catastrophic events.
Officials at the World Health Organization have mostly praised Chinese leaders for taking 'decisive' measures that few other governments would have been able to take.
In late January, authorities locked down Hubei, effectively shutting off 55 million people from the outside world. Cities have rolled out draconian measures such as suspending vehicle traffic, limiting the number of days residents can leave their homes, and closing hospitals " steps national health officials say are proving effective in minimizing contagion.
The government, meanwhile, has repeatedly asked the public for its sacrifice and forbearance. Chinese leader Xi Jinping often calls for a 'people's war' against the virus, and state media refer to the containment effort as 'zhanyi,' a Chinese pun that is a homophone with 'military campaign.'
'Since the onset of this epidemic, the Chinese government, putting people's health first, has done its utmost to make sure every patient receives timely treatment,' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters this month. 'At the same time, we have seen so many touching stories of people sacrificing themselves for the greater good.'
An obstacle course
Chen Xuanyi, a graduate student in Australia who is part of a network of 30 volunteers trying to lobby hospitals to accept people seeking medical attention, said she has compiled a list of 175 sick patients across China who have been turned away from hospitals, but there are countless more who don't know how to use the Internet to ask for help.
Chen's colleagues call those seeking help, assess their condition and then connect the sickest with the few nearby hospitals that will still accept them. The patients often need dialysis or surgeries or urgent medication refills, Chen said, but many are refused because hospitals don't want to risk admitting patients or conducting invasive procedures that could leave them infected.
The group has gotten help for more than 40 seriously ill patients, but five have died at home while awaiting treatment, Chen said.
'We talk to people who are waiting two, three, four days while their condition steadily deteriorates,' she said. At the end, she said, 'they just run out of options.'
With the clock ticking, many families with sick or dying say they face an array of obstacles. Week-old An An in southwest Hubei was suffering a blood disorder that needed an advanced hospital's attention, her father and grandmother said.
Large hospitals across Hubei were subsumed by the virus and had little capacity to handle special pediatric cases, they said. Authorities were offering to issue a special travel permit for them to leave the otherwise locked-down province, but hospitals in neighboring Hunan were wary of accepting patients from Hubei because they are seen as more likely to carry the virus.
'Does she have a week to live? A month? A day?' said An An's grandmother, Zhao Yulong, taking over the speakerphone after her father, Wang Hongbin, broke down with emotion.
The family has been watching the baby doze round-the-clock. They celebrate when she opens her eyes.
'We are waiting and taking care of her as best as we can,' Zhao said. 'We only know that she is showing a strong survival instinct.'
The circumstances have forced many Chinese to turn to remote consultations. Ping An Good Doctor, a Shanghai-based company owned by the Ping An insurance giant, said that patients have used its smartphone app to talk to doctors 1.1 billion times since the epidemic began, and that average daily consultations are nine times higher than usual.
Still, the calls do little to soothe anxious patients.
'We had to beg for help'
After being diagnosed Feb. 15 with a five-inch tumor on her liver, a 27-year-old woman with the last name Liu said she was told by a doctor to travel urgently from the outskirts of Wuhan to the city center to seek a surgeon. A day later, her friends arranged a ride with one of the few designated drivers still allowed on the streets, and Liu arrived in downtown Wuhan only to discover that surgical departments were closed.
In the days since, she has phoned doctors about whether the tumor is malignant, Liu said.
'That only lessens the psychological affliction a little, but it does nothing about the underlying physical condition,' Liu said from her sister's Wuhan apartment while she waits for oncology departments to open. 'I still feel helpless.'
Authorities this week began censoring patients seeking help on social media and instructed them to contact government hotlines instead of making their pleas public.
The nationwide triage and the anger among some patients has become a politically sensitive issue, said Yanzhong Huang, who studies the Chinese health system at the Council on Foreign Relations.
'When you frame the issue as an existential threat and use war slogans, it might lead to extraordinary measures that have unintended consequences,' Huang said. But when ordinary Chinese hear stories of people being denied medical care, he added, 'people might say, 'This is ridiculous.' '
Suffering from advanced kidney cancer, Yu Hongwei was one of the patients discharged by Wuhan Union Hospital's tumor center on Jan. 25 " just as he was about to enter surgery " to make way for coronavirus patients. Doctors apologized and said it wasn't their decision, Yu's sister Hongyan recalled.
Back at home, Yu's skin turned yellow as his pancreas failed. He vomited what little he ate and was kept alive by a nutrient drip. After a week of online petitioning and volunteer networks lobbying for Yu's case, a smaller district hospital in Wuhan agreed to admit Hongwei. A surgeon from Wuhan Union rushed over to operate on Feb. 16.
A day later, a relieved Yu Hongyan told The Post that what saved her brother was the kindness of volunteers and doctors, and a hospital that bent its rules, after Wuhan's broader health system broke down.
'We never gave up,' she said. 'We had to beg for help online, because there was no other way.'

Saudi Arabia is considering a break from its four-year oil-production alliance with Russia, according to people familiar with the matter, as China's coronavirus outbreak contributes to a drop in global oil demand.
The Saudi kingdom, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates -- which collectively represent over half of OPEC's production capacity -- are holding talks to discuss a possible joint output cut of as much as 300,000 barrels a day, the people said.
The coronavirus outbreak has created a rift in the partnership between Russia and the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The two sides have collaborated since December 2016 in an effort to balance global oil supply amid a surge of crude from U.S. shale producers. If the Saudis, Kuwait and the U.A.E. break with the Russians, the split could further weaken OPEC's ability to influence oil prices.
The new tensions come ahead of the group's early March gathering in Vienna, where it aims to reach a consensus on how much crude to deliver to an already oversupplied market.
At an emergency meeting earlier in February, Russia rejected a Saudi push to deepen the alliance's existing oil production curbs by 600,000 barrels a day.
Russian officials still don't see a need for reductions, the people familiar with the matter said. Russian delegates say business activity in China is recovering and the impact of the virus on oil demand is limited, the people said.
Saudi exports to China have remained stable since the crisis began, though sales from other OPEC members have shown weakness, according to commodities-data provider Kpler.
Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has compared the virus's effect on oil demand to a fire that needs to be put out, according to a person familiar with the matter. In one option under consideration, Saudi Arabia and its two Persian Gulf neighbors would reduce production without coordinating with a group of 10 non-OPEC nations led by Russia.
The divergence of opinion over coronavirus's effect on oil demand goes beyond OPEC. The International Energy Agency warned Feb. 13 that demand for oil is likely to be 435,000 barrels a day less in the current quarter compared with a year ago. Vitol Group, the world's largest independent oil trader, cut its forecast demand for the quarter to 98.3 million barrels a day, down 2.2 million barrels a day from its previous forecast for the period. Under either scenario, a quarterly decline would be the first since the height of the global financial crisis.
However, Moscow says weakened demand would be offset by reduced supply resulting from Libya's oil shutdown and new sanctions targeting Venezuela's crude sales, one person familiar with the matter said.
Libya's oil output has fallen to 120,000 barrels a day from 1.2 million daily barrels since a renegade general shut pipelines and oil ports in January in a dispute with the central government.
The U.S. on Tuesday imposed sanctions on a subsidiary of Russian state-run company Rosneft Oil Co. that had become the main marketer of banned Venezuelan crude. The new restrictions could cut Venezuelan exports by 600,000 barrels a day, said energy consulting firm FGE, which sees the market tightening by June as a result of the Libyan and Venezuelan disruptions.
"Russia's arguments for doing nothing may have some validity," it said.

The coronavirus is proving costly for global business -- and insurance won't be much help.
With large parts of China in lockdown and other Asian countries on high alert, the virus, which causes an acute respiratory disease called Covid-19, has disrupted shops, hotels, airlines, factories and much else. Multinationals including Apple and Starbucks have closed many outlets in mainland China.
It has some companies poring over insurance policies in hopes of filing a claim for losses from business interruptions. "We are getting lots of questions about it," said Gisele Norris, a strategic account manager at insurance broker and consultant Aon PLC, and co-leader of its global infectious disease task force.
The odds of getting help aren't great. Insurers and reinsurers learned a costly lesson from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002 and 2003.
In Hong Kong, 325 million Hong Kong dollars (US$41.8 million) was claimed for business interruptions from SARS; hotel chain Mandarin Oriental International Ltd. alone recouped US$16 million from its insurers, led by American International Group Inc.
Now insurers across the board exclude epidemics in standard business-interruption policies, which mainly cover property damage from events such as fire, terrorism and natural catastrophes.
"Since the SARS outbreak, insurers added specific exclusions for bacterial or viral outbreaks to our insurance coverage," said a spokeswoman for Yum China Holdings Inc., which operates Pizza Hut and KFC in China and is the country's biggest restaurant group.
Forced to close more than three in 10 outlets, the group has warned of possible operating losses for at least the first quarter. Yum has a prudent financial policy and maintains a strong balance sheet, the spokeswoman added.
"The potential losses from communicable diseases can be terribly large," said Simon McConnell, Hong Kong-based managing partner at law firm Clyde &Co. "If all economic losses were insured, it would become commercially unviable for insurers themselves."
"Insurers are in the business of covering risks they can understand," said Neil Thomas, head of claims for Asia at insurance broker Willis Towers Watson. "There's not an insurer on the planet willing to put themselves on the front line of something they can't quantify."
The current epidemic is broader in scale than SARS. It is also hitting a Chinese economy that is much larger and more connected to the world than in 2003, so the economic impact is likely to exceed the $54 billion that the World Bank estimates SARS cost the global economy.
Disruptions in China's service sector alone could slice 474 billion yuan ($67.5 billion) off gross domestic product in the first quarter, China Renaissance Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd. estimates, with additional GDP lost in manufacturing and construction.
Insurers do offer costlier extended policies that cover public-health risks, often bought by leisure and travel companies. But they come with strict conditions.
Earlier this month, China's government ordered casinos in the semiautonomous city of Macau -- which include units of Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Sheldon Adelson's Las Vegas Sands Corp. -- to shut their doors for an unprecedented 15 days to help curb the spread of the virus. Their insurance, though, pays off only for closures caused by an infected person, according to Willis Towers Watson's Mr. Thomas.
"All the casinos have been looking carefully at their policies," he said Thursday. "No claims have been filed as of this moment, although some may make claims in due course."
With Macau reporting no additional cases since the shutdown, the casinos were allowed to reopen Thursday.

Arriving at a hotel on Jan. 26 in a city about 200 miles from Wuhan, our plan was set. My colleague Shan Li and I would leave in the early-morning darkness the following day, traveling by car into the city to report from the center of a deadly viral epidemic.
Almost immediately, we were visited by hotel staff and local officials, who brought a warning: Go back to Beijing or face lockdown.
They never told us how they knew we were there, though foreign visitors like us have to show passports when checking into Chinese hotels. We are both U.S. citizens who are credentialed to work as journalists in China.
For days afterward, authorities blocked us from leaving the hotel and checked on our health constantly. A young man monitored us from a room across the hall, even following Shan down to the lobby at 3 a.m. one night in yellow-and-black pajamas.
The coronavirus epidemic, which has infected more than 75,000 world-wide and killed more than 2,200 people in China alone, is an unprecedented test of Chinese leader Xi Jinping's government and the vast surveillance state China has built during the past five years under his rule.
Never before has a nation tried to put so many people -- more than 60 million -- under full-time quarantine. Hundreds of millions more are being discouraged from leaving their homes.
Others are being tracked by China's leviathan surveillance system, which uses facial recognition and other technologies to monitor people's movements.
Checkpoints have been set up to keep people from driving freely in and out of towns or leaving their apartment complexes. Neighborhood-watch captains are keeping tabs on residents everywhere. Some drugstores have been required to report sales of fever and cough medicine to track down potential patients.
Our Shanghai-based reporter, Jim Areddy, also experienced the reach of the government's response to the epidemic. Within a day of returning home from a reporting trip to Wuhan in late January, his wife got a call from a neighborhood policeman, and he got a text message from the local government. Both indicated his trip was a problem.
The text message told Jim, a U.S. citizen, to promptly report his presence and ended with a slogan: "Let's work together to safeguard the health of citizens and the safety of the city!" It didn't say how they knew where he had been.
He was told to remain in his apartment for 14 days as a precaution to prevent the spread of the virus. Each day, the chief of his building's Communist Party neighborhood committee -- the front line to enforcing policies such as fire regulations and trash separation -- stopped by or sent an underling. Other visitors came by in goggles and hazmat suits. A woman in surgical garb and gloves, who identified herself as Dr. Zhong, instructed him to put his signature on a form promising to remain housebound.
When Jim struggled to recall his flight number from Wuhan, he says a man with her who didn't identify himself provided it.
The only time Jim ventured outside, at 2 a.m. to toss out the garbage, he hunched under his hoodie to avoid lobby surveillance cameras. The next morning, visitors in space suits with disinfectant spray bottles knocked on his door requesting his trash.
Of course, all three of us were fortunate compared with the tens of thousands of people who have the virus, and the millions more who face restrictions that are hurting their ability to earn wages, obtain necessities such as medicines, and visit loved ones. Human-rights groups have decried China's coronavirus clampdown, arguing it unnecessarily impinges on people's rights and slows the free movement of drugs and supplies without necessarily stopping the virus.
From our vantage point, it is hard to tell what the final impact of China's massive quarantine policy on the virus will be. But it is difficult to imagine any other nation being able to control the movements of so many people. And it is clear the controls are generating fear and paranoia.
For Shan and me, our quarantine began in late January. Unable to enter Wuhan directly because it was under lockdown, we flew to the city of Nanyang, 250 miles to the northwest. We made it by train to Xiangyang, the third-most-populous city in Hubei province. We checked into a hotel and planned to push on in a hired car later.
Soon after our arrival, however, hotel staff and local authorities started showing up at our doors, including Wang Jianjun, deputy director of the Foreign Affairs Office of Xiangyang's government.
"Given the circumstances, let's not shake hands," he said, holding his hands up. Saying the situation in Hubei was dire, he pleaded with us to leave while we still could. "I would tell my own daughters to do the same," he said.
The authorities gave us an out: A train would be able to take us to Chengdu, where we could fly back to Beijing.
Still determined to do our reporting, we declined the offer. "Then you need to understand that you will not be able to leave the hotel at all," one of the officials snapped.
Mr. Wang suggested we apply for a spot on an evacuation flight out of Wuhan being offered by the U.S. State Department for American citizens and their families, to be followed by a 14-day quarantine in the U.S.
When Shan asked whether he could instead help us get back to Beijing via Henan, a province north of Wuhan city, he laughed and said those borders were closed.
Then Mr. Wang warned us that after two weeks, we could leave our rooms but not the hotel. That decided it for us: a two-week quarantine in the U.S. over an indefinite one in China.
After a mad dash to catch the last of the evacuation flights, we arrived on U.S. soil. I landed at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, while Shan wound up at Travis Air Force Base near Sacramento.
Our colleague Jim's quarantine at his apartment in China ended on Feb. 6, two weeks after it began. Ours in the U.S. ended on Thursday, after a total 25 days in quarantine.

As China fights virus, other patients languish

Overburdened hospitals turning away people with dire and chronic illnesses
BEIJING " Nie Mingtao arrived at Wuhan Union Hospital's tumor center on Feb. 9, hoping to continue with chemotherapy treatment for the late-stage lung cancer that had left him unable to eat or sleep.
When Nie arrived, paperwork in order, a doctor apologized and turned him away: The hospital was emptying its cancer ward to make room for patients suffering from the coronavirus that was ravaging Hubei province, said his son, Nie Wenjie.
A month into its battle to contain the outbreak, China is overseeing an unprecedented triage on a national level by scaling back or suspending public health services for patients with ailments unrelated to the epidemic.
Within Hubei province at the outbreak's epicenter, hospitals are so overwhelmed by the disease that they lack manpower or beds to treat hardly anything else. Beyond Hubei, hospitals from Chongqing in the southwest to Beijing in the north, in an all-out effort to minimize the chance of virus transmission, are choosing to shutter departments and reject patients seeking surgeries, kidney dialysis, diabetes medication and help for a variety of other conditions.
A United Nations program said this week that one-third of Chinese living with HIV say they are at risk of running out of antiretroviral medication and that many don't know how they can get their next refill.
'This is not right,' said Nie Wenjie, 28, this week from his rural village in northern Hubei as he watched his father heave and moan, his condition worsening. 'All the lives not touched by the coronavirus " are those lives not worth saving?'
As the outbreak's second-order effects ripple across China, the breakdown of the health system is posing a logistical and ethical challenge for the government. Chinese social media has been flooded by so many pleas under the hashtag '#NonPneumonia PatientSeekingHelp' that authorities this week began censoring posts. Although nationwide statistics are not available, families and networks of volunteers who monitor such cases say there are patients dying at home because they cannot access timely care.
Sacrificing some to save others
In phone conversations with The Washington Post, six families with sick relatives across China described their frustration as the country mobilizes a vast operation to combat an epidemic its leaders consider their public health and political priority. Some individuals asked that their names be withheld in full or in part for privacy reasons.
One western Hubei family was near collapse seeking aid for their week-old baby, whose blood disease case was being rejected by hospitals. A man from Inner Mongolia rented an apartment in Beijing and walked to a hospital every day for weeks to check if doctors would operate on his father's tumor. Another woman in the capital who was on the verge of kidney failure pleaded for help with operators on several city emergency hotlines, who said there were no facilities that could provide dialysis. She was admitted to a hospital Tuesday only after she aired her case online and volunteers came to her aid.
'I'm not saying there should be equal weight between epidemic patients and everyone else, but why not set aside a few more hospitals for non-fever patients?' said Nie Wenjie.
In an interview, Gordon Liu, a Peking University professor who serves on the Chinese National Health Commission's expert advisory committee on the novel coronavirus, said infection containment policies have 'lost balance.'
'To avoid 1 percent chance of infection, are we choosing 99 percent chance of so many people suffering?' Liu said. 'To create a situation that exacts a greater human cost than the virus itself " that would be the greatest regret of all.'
Hospitals, including in the United States, have been known to turn away people trying to visit patients during influenza outbreaks. Hospitals worldwide also seal off wards when transmissible diseases break out inside, such as during the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic in 2003. But public health experts say the phenomenon of hospitals across a country rejecting large numbers of patients as a precautionary measure is rare.
'I've never heard of this happening as a precaution,' said Eric Toner, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who has advised U.S. governments and hospitals on preparedness for catastrophic events.
Officials at the World Health Organization have mostly praised Chinese leaders for taking 'decisive' measures that few other governments would have been able to take.
In late January, authorities locked down Hubei, effectively shutting off 55 million people from the outside world. Cities have rolled out draconian measures such as suspending vehicle traffic, limiting the number of days residents can leave their homes, and closing hospitals " steps national health officials say are proving effective in minimizing contagion.
The government, meanwhile, has repeatedly asked the public for its sacrifice and forbearance. Chinese leader Xi Jinping often calls for a 'people's war' against the virus, and state media refer to the containment effort as 'zhanyi,' a Chinese pun that is a homophone with 'military campaign.'
'Since the onset of this epidemic, the Chinese government, putting people's health first, has done its utmost to make sure every patient receives timely treatment,' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters this month. 'At the same time, we have seen so many touching stories of people sacrificing themselves for the greater good.'
An obstacle course
Chen Xuanyi, a graduate student in Australia who is part of a network of 30 volunteers trying to lobby hospitals to accept people seeking medical attention, said she has compiled a list of 175 sick patients across China who have been turned away from hospitals, but there are countless more who don't know how to use the Internet to ask for help.
Chen's colleagues call those seeking help, assess their condition and then connect the sickest with the few nearby hospitals that will still accept them. The patients often need dialysis or surgeries or urgent medication refills, Chen said, but many are refused because hospitals don't want to risk admitting patients or conducting invasive procedures that could leave them infected.
The group has gotten help for more than 40 seriously ill patients, but five have died at home while awaiting treatment, Chen said.
'We talk to people who are waiting two, three, four days while their condition steadily deteriorates,' she said. At the end, she said, 'they just run out of options.'
With the clock ticking, many families with sick or dying say they face an array of obstacles. Week-old An An in southwest Hubei was suffering a blood disorder that needed an advanced hospital's attention, her father and grandmother said.
Large hospitals across Hubei were subsumed by the virus and had little capacity to handle special pediatric cases, they said. Authorities were offering to issue a special travel permit for them to leave the otherwise locked-down province, but hospitals in neighboring Hunan were wary of accepting patients from Hubei because they are seen as more likely to carry the virus.
'Does she have a week to live? A month? A day?' said An An's grandmother, Zhao Yulong, taking over the speakerphone after her father, Wang Hongbin, broke down with emotion.
The family has been watching the baby doze round-the-clock. They celebrate when she opens her eyes.
'We are waiting and taking care of her as best as we can,' Zhao said. 'We only know that she is showing a strong survival instinct.'
The circumstances have forced many Chinese to turn to remote consultations. Ping An Good Doctor, a Shanghai-based company owned by the Ping An insurance giant, said that patients have used its smartphone app to talk to doctors 1.1 billion times since the epidemic began, and that average daily consultations are nine times higher than usual.
Still, the calls do little to soothe anxious patients.
'We had to beg for help'
After being diagnosed Feb. 15 with a five-inch tumor on her liver, a 27-year-old woman with the last name Liu said she was told by a doctor to travel urgently from the outskirts of Wuhan to the city center to seek a surgeon. A day later, her friends arranged a ride with one of the few designated drivers still allowed on the streets, and Liu arrived in downtown Wuhan only to discover that surgical departments were closed.
In the days since, she has phoned doctors about whether the tumor is malignant, Liu said.
'That only lessens the psychological affliction a little, but it does nothing about the underlying physical condition,' Liu said from her sister's Wuhan apartment while she waits for oncology departments to open. 'I still feel helpless.'
Authorities this week began censoring patients seeking help on social media and instructed them to contact government hotlines instead of making their pleas public.
The nationwide triage and the anger among some patients has become a politically sensitive issue, said Yanzhong Huang, who studies the Chinese health system at the Council on Foreign Relations.
'When you frame the issue as an existential threat and use war slogans, it might lead to extraordinary measures that have unintended consequences,' Huang said. But when ordinary Chinese hear stories of people being denied medical care, he added, 'people might say, 'This is ridiculous.' ' 
Suffering from advanced kidney cancer, Yu Hongwei was one of the patients discharged by Wuhan Union Hospital's tumor center on Jan. 25 " just as he was about to enter surgery " to make way for coronavirus patients. Doctors apologized and said it wasn't their decision, Yu's sister Hongyan recalled.
Back at home, Yu's skin turned yellow as his pancreas failed. He vomited what little he ate and was kept alive by a nutrient drip. After a week of online petitioning and volunteer networks lobbying for Yu's case, a smaller district hospital in Wuhan agreed to admit Hongwei. A surgeon from Wuhan Union rushed over to operate on Feb. 16.
A day later, a relieved Yu Hongyan told The Post that what saved her brother was the kindness of volunteers and doctors, and a hospital that bent its rules, after Wuhan's broader health system broke down.
'We never gave up,' she said. 'We had to beg for help online, because there was no other way.'

Infections increase among cruise ship passengers evacuated to U.S.

Twenty-eight U.S. residents flown home from the Diamond Princess cruise ship are infected with coronavirus, and health officials expect to see more positive cases among the evacuated passengers in coming days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.
The passengers from the ship, along with three infected people previously returned from Wuhan, China, bring the total number of evacuees with the virus in the United States to 31. An additional 13 people in the United States either picked up the infection by traveling to China or from close contact with a family member who had been in China.
The passengers are 'considered at high risk of infection and we do expect to see additional cases,' Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a media briefing.
The sharp rise in the number of U.S. patients came on a day of grim news about the spread of covid-19, the viral respiratory disease that has afflicted more than 76,000 people and killed more than 2,300, mainly in China.
The number of cases in South Korea surged to 346, with more than half linked to a secretive religious movement with a messianic leader. Iran confirmed 18 cases, including four deaths, centered in Qom, a Shiite holy city south of Tehran. In Beijing, two hospitals were put under quarantine amid fears of a coronavirus outbreak in China's capital, with one district reporting an 'infection density' second only to Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic.
The Japanese government quarantined 3,700 passengers and crew members aboard the Diamond Princess for nearly two weeks, a decision that allowed the virus to sweep through the ship, which one Japanese expert has said was plagued by poor infection control. Now, 634 of those onboard have tested positive " the second-largest number in any place outside China.
Last weekend, the State Department flew 329 U.S. residents home from the ship on two chartered flights. The Washington Post reported Thursday that the evacuation was delayed for hours by a last-minute disagreement among government officials. As the passengers arrived at the airport in buses, test results came back indicating 14 people waiting to evacuate were infected with coronavirus.
CDC officials did not want to put sick people on the plane with uninfected passengers, but they were overruled by the State Department and another top government health official.
At Friday's briefing, Ian Brownlee, principal deputy assistant secretary in the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, said the tests for those 14 people were conducted 48 to 72 hours before they boarded the buses, indicating they were infected on the ship.
It's not clear where all the infected Americans are being treated. Eleven are receiving care at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Five are receiving care at hospitals around Travis Air Force Base near Sacramento, where one plane landed, and two are being treated near Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio, where the other flight arrived.
Dozens of other Americans from the cruise ship who tested positive were taken off the ship before the evacuation and are still in Japanese hospitals. They include Wayne and Susan Hidalgo of Kansas City, Kan., who wondered why the ship continued to allow people to mingle freely onboard, even after a passenger onboard was diagnosed with the virus. One of the people Wayne Hidalgo regularly dined with had shared a bus with the infected passenger.
'As time went on, after a day or so, I wondered, why are we eating dinner with these people? Why is everybody out dancing? Why are they having these shows going on?' the 77-year-old said in a telephone interview from his hospital bed in Tokyo. 
Japan's Health Ministry said 88 Americans aboard the ship have been diagnosed with covid-19. Most have been taken to hospitals on land. 
The Hidalgos' children want them brought home, arguing that it's 'not fair' they've been left in Japan while other Americans were evacuated. Wayne Hidalgo said he knows the couple can't leave until they are given the all-clear by Japanese doctors. They each need two consecutive negative tests.
Wayne Hidalgo said he is suffering from mild pneumonia. Susan Hidalgo has no symptoms.
Wayne Hidalgo said he has become 'more and more confident' with the medical care he is receiving as time goes by, and is 'totally impressed' with his hospital, his doctor " who speaks fluent English " and nurses who are 'wonderful and funny.'
'Susan, my wife, and I have both accepted the fact that we've got to stay mentally healthy, and exercise some, and stay here,' he said.
An official from the U.S. Embassy has visited, bringing them clothes and local currency, while Princess Cruises, the cruise line that operates the ship, has been in contact every day.
On Feb. 1, a Diamond Princess passenger from Hong Kong, who had left the ship Jan.-25, was diagnosed with the virus. Princess Cruises said it learned about this on social media the next day and reached out to Hong Kong authorities. On Feb. 3, the captain told passengers the ship would wait in Yokohama while Japanese Health Ministry officials assessed the situation. But passengers still mingled, including at a buffet dinner on Feb.-4. It was only later they were told to stay in their cabins. 
John Haering, 63, from Tooele, Utah, said he came down with a fever that reached 103.6-degrees on Feb.-10, but was not seen by a doctor until 5-p.m. the following day. For 2 1/2 days, his wife, Melanie, put wet cloths on his forehead to keep him cool, replacing them every 20 minutes. 
He wasn't evacuated from the ship to a Tokyo hospital until Feb.-13. His fever had subsided by then. He has been in isolation ever since, with very little human contact. He takes his own temperature, and meals are passed through a stainless-steel cabinet with doors on two sides. Once a day, a nurse in full protective gear comes in to clean his room.
He said he has received just one phone call from the U.S. Embassy and no contact with Carnival Corp., the British-American company based in Doral, Fla., that owns Princess Cruises.
'I have, as my doctor described it, bad pneumonia. I'm fighting each day to stay positive and healthy,' he said. 'I don't need the uncertainty of what will happen to me weighing on my thoughts.'
In a statement, the U.S. State Department said 'the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad' is one of its highest priorities, including providing 'all appropriate consular assistance' to U.S. citizens remaining in Japan, and visiting those who have been hospitalized from the Diamond Princess.

Help China fight coronavirus 
When another country is hit by a disaster such as an epidemic, the decent thing to do is to help first, criticize later. Unfortunately for some people, the default mode of dealing with China is to criticize and condemn.
When Ivo Daalder wrote in his guest commentary ("China's secrecy has made the coronavirus crisis much worse," Feb. 14) that "Beijing did not allow a WHO investigating team to enter China until this week," he should at least do a fact-check with the World Health Organization. In fact, as early as Jan. 22, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus mentioned in his statement on the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee on Novel Coronavirus that "our team in China is working with local experts and officials to investigate the outbreak." China has made it clear many times that it welcomes foreign experts' participation, including those from the U.S., in the China-WHO joint mission.
There is no doubt that early action is essential to stop the spread of virulent diseases. But how to develop an early warning system? The challenge is handling an avalanche of information, from diverse public and private sources and of variegated and uncertain quality. Human society has evolved in the fight against various epidemics. That is the case for all countries and also for China. When the epidemic is over, we will of course look back and summarize experiences to see what can be done to improve the public health services in China, including our capacity.
Daalder mentioned that a county epidemiologist in Washington state traced everyone the first coronavirus patient in the U.S. had been in contact with very efficiently. But he forgot to mention that the epidemiologist was able to do that just because China had been transparent and quick in sharing key information of the virus with the WHO and the international community.
In stark contrast to some of the biased reporting, China's whole-nation mobilization to fight the outbreak is unprecedented. Never before in human history has an entire country been put on a war footing just to fight a contagious disease.
It is no secret that China has a political system different from that of the U.S. Some people just tend to make China's political system an issue whenever they feel it politically convenient. But please seek truth from facts, and don't be automatically critical or condemnatory. Otherwise, the integrity of the argument would only be questioned.
-- Zhao Jian, consul general, People's Republic of China in Chicago 
Bloomberg, use money to do good
Many times, first impressions are lasting impressions. Prior to Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg's appearance on the debate stage Wednesday night, I thought I was in for the greatest debate, but instead my first impression was: "OMG, after one hour, how ridiculous is this?!" I turned off the TV and went to bed.
What a bunch of politicians we have! The new kid on the block, Bloomberg, needs to sit back, thank God for all his riches and spend his hard-earned billions helping others who truly need to meet their bills. He can then be thankful he's really doing the will of God instead of wasting his money on TV ads that make him sound as if he can rule the world. He truly believes he is the only one who knows the answers to all of our problems. He and Donald Trump can be co-presidents who can save us all: the new party, Dem-Reps! What a waste of my time!
-- Anna M. Miller, Prospect Heights 
It's painful to watch Democrats
I can't bear to watch the debates. I find it painful to see the Democrats attacking each other. They are laying the grounds for every upcoming Republican ad and making it difficult for them and their supporters to turn around and support the final nominee.
I think there should be one debate early on so we see all the potential candidates. After that, I think it should be a series of interviews with a panel. Save the debates for the nominee and President Donald Trump.
-- Joyce Porter, Oak Park 
Dems obsessed with perfection
What a shame it is that Democrats may fail to get behind any candidate who isn't 100% perfect, and end up losing to an incumbent who is 100% evil.
-- Kenneth Leone, Deerfield

How the Chinese Communist Party intimidates overseas Chinese citizens

On Feb. 8, the night before I went to a vigil for Dr. Li Wenliang in New York's Central Park, one of my friends warned me: "Wear a mask and sunglasses. Don't show your face. Protect yourself." I thanked her for her kindness but decided not to wear any "protection." What danger would I face if I'm just mourning a doctor who had saved countless lives by being a "whistleblower" about the rapidly spreading coronavirus and eventually died because of it? 
When I arrived at the vigil, however, I saw that a majority of the people there were wearing masks and a few wore sunglasses, and then I realized my friend was not kidding. You can be in danger by showing up at a gathering that may be viewed as a demonstration of discontent with the Chinese government, even if it's held in New York, 6,824 miles away from Beijing.
This incident was not isolated from our daily lives. Every Chinese friend I know who lives in the United States uses the messaging platform WeChat to communicate with their families and friends in China, and most of us follow the unspoken protocol of not criticizing the Chinese government while having discussions in WeChat groups, sharing articles or posts in WeChat Moments or even having private conversations with families and friends.
The all-pervasive censorship by WeChat or Chinese authorities has in fact silenced most of us overseas Chinese. There was recently an article on the Dongying City official website praising the efficiency of the internet censorship police, stating that they spend 20 hours every day deleting posts and have the target of deleting any "rumor post" within 30 minutes of its publishing. The article inadvertently stimulated another wave of fury among Chinese internet users, and the original article can no longer be found (though copies are circulating online).
Despite the fact that we reside in a country that protects freedom of speech, we feel too insecure to criticize the Chinese government on a Chinese app. We fear losing connections with our families and friends in China if our WeChat accounts are blocked; we fear potential vengeance by the Chinese government against our families in China; we also fear the possibility of never being able to return to China because of the danger of getting arrested.
Our fear is not baseless. In July 2019, one Chinese student, Luo Daiqing, from the University of Minnesota, was arrested while he was visiting his family in Wuhan during the summer break and sentenced to prison for six months because he had, while in the U.S., tweeted certain cartoon images that were judged by a court in Wuhan to "uglify" President Xi Jinping.
On Aug. 1, the Chinese website Sohu reported that arrests were made in four Chinese cities (Wuhan, Nanjing, Yichang, Dalian) on the same day of people who had posted certain anti-China statements or cartoons while they were living overseas. A passage at the end of the article sends a very clear and intimidating message to overseas Chinese: "Even if you are overseas, think twice before you post anything on the internet. People can get into trouble by just saying certain things. If you violate the relevant Chinese rules by posting on the internet overseas, you will be prosecuted when you return to China!"
Those arrests could be part of an apparent top-down campaign to intimidate overseas Chinese into not exercising their freedoms of speech in other countries.
Over the course of several high-level meetings in China in January and February about managing the coronavirus epidemic, officials -- including President Xi -- have emphasized the importance of controlling the international community's media reaction to the outbreak.
Our fear is not just about using Chinese apps.
Our use of YouTube seems to be targeted as well. Since the coronavirus outbreak, Chen Qiushi, a citizen journalist, and Fang Bin, an ordinary businessman in Wuhan, had been posting YouTube videos about what was happening in Wuhan. The video bloggers were attacked with vicious comments, calling them liars and traitors. Now, Chen has been missing since Feb. 6, and Fang has been missing since Feb. 11.
Born and raised in China, I've known since I was very young that there are certain topics that can't be discussed openly in China. Among them are the Cultural Revolution and the Tiananmen Square crackdown. But growing up in the golden years of 1990s and early 2000s, after the Reform and Opening-up by Deng Xiaoping, I have had teachers in high school and professors in college who criticized the Chinese government in certain ways without getting into any trouble.
Those days are now gone. In the past few years, dozens of Chinese professors have been silenced, arrested or exiled because of their criticism of the Chinese government, including my wife's constitutional law professor at Tsinghua Law School, Xu Zhangrun. What's more tragic is that some of the professors were reported to the police by their own students.
This would have been unimaginable when I was in college, when students like me were eager to learn about the professors' insights on different political and legal systems, which unavoidably included criticisms of the systems, including that of China.
We all then understood the intention behind these discussions was to make our society a better one for ordinary Chinese people.
Another Tsinghua Law School professor, Lao Dongyan, wrote in a recent article: "If criticism is not allowed, then praise is meaningless." I was lucky to have had mentors who instilled in me the importance of independent thinking and criticism when I studied in China. But now, as I stand in the land of liberty, where freedom rings, I still feel every day the contradiction of freedom of speech and fear of consequences.

E*Trade, Apple, Walmart: Stocks That Defined the Week; Here are seven major companies whose stocks moved on the week's news

E*Trade Financial Corp.
The long-predicted M&A frenzy in the wealth management industry is here. Wall Street stalwart Morgan Stanley agreed to buy discount broker E*Trade in a $13 billion deal announced Thursday. The all-stock deal is the biggest takeover by a giant U.S. bank since the 2008 crisis. Earlier in the week, money manager Franklin Resources Inc. agreed to buy rival Legg Mason Inc. for $4.5 billion in cash . E*Trade shares soared 22% Thursday.
Apple Inc.
The coronavirus is rippling through the world's most valuable company. Apple said Monday it won't meet its revenue projections for the current quarter, as the coronavirus has limited iPhone production and curtailed demand in China. Apple's announcement is the most prominent example yet of the effects of the virus on global business and markets. Apple's dependency on China's manufacturing and consumer sectors makes the company vulnerable as the coronavirus outbreak paralyzes the country. The company said the situation in China is evolving, and it will provide more information when it holds its earnings call in April. Apple shares fell 1.8% Tuesday.
Walmart Inc.
Even the world's biggest retailer struggled to get shoppers to spend during the holiday season. Walmart executives said the critical period started strong around Thanksgiving but sales of toys, videogames and apparel softened in the weeks before Christmas. Chief Executive Doug McMillon said store sales suffered from a late Thanksgiving as well as some merchandising missteps, such as a lack of high-price, in-demand holiday toys and a glut of inexpensive clothes and seasonal attire. Meanwhile, Walmart's U.S. e-commerce sales rose 35% in the fourth quarter, boosted by online grocery orders. Shares rose 1.5% Tuesday.
Bed Bath &Beyond Inc.
The new CEO of Bed Bath &Belong wants to eliminate "purchase paralysis." To do that, Mark Tritton wants to declutter stores, make aisles wider and stop piling merchandise up to the ceiling. The former Target Corp. executive laid out his vision for remaking the troubled retailer Tuesday. Mr. Tritton plans to trim inventory by more than 10% this year, part of a broader plan that calls for spending as much as $400 million on store remodels, technology upgrades and supply-chain improvements. He joined the struggling company in November after its top officials, including the founders, were ousted by an activist investor. Shares gained 5.4% Tuesday.
L Brands Inc.
Les Wexner is giving up control of Victoria's Secret. The 82-year-old billionaire behind the lingerie brand and Bath &Body Works agreed Thursday to sell a controlling stake in the Victoria's Secret chain to private-equity firm Sycamore Partners for $525 million. He also agreed to step down as chairman and chief executive of L Brands. His decision to part ways with Victoria's Secret is an admission that Mr. Wexner couldn't revive the fortunes of the troubled brand he built around shopping malls and sex appeal. The deal leaves the Victoria's Secret business as a separate private company, and L Brands will be reduced to running one chain: Bath &Body Works. L Brands shares fell 3.6% Thursday.
ViacomCBS Inc.
ViacomCBS has a tough year ahead. The company reported a loss in the quarter as Viacom completed its merger with CBS and said it is targeting $750 million in cost cuts for the year, increasing its guidance from $500 million. The company also unveiled its three main streaming plans that will compete with Netflix Inc. and others: a free ad-supported service called Pluto TV, an expanded version of CBS All Access, and a third service anchored by Showtime that will be the most expensive option. "We believe this strategy of free, broad pay and premium pay is where the market will go," Chief Executive Bob Bakish said. Shares plummeted 18% Thursday.
Wells Fargo &Co.
Wells Fargo has reached a settlement with the government over its long-running fake-account scandal. The nation's fourth-largest bank agreed Friday to pay $3 billion to settle investigations by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is a victory for Charles Scharf, the bank's new boss who was tasked with resolving the crisis. Regulators and prosecutors could still take action against individuals involved in the debacle, in which it became public in 2016 that an aggressive sales culture led employees to open millions of possibly fake accounts. Last month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency charged eight former Wells Fargo executives over the scandal, including the former CEO. Wells Fargo shares gained 0.8% Friday.

Tech and Utilities Stocks Both Rally in Polarized Market; Two best-performing sectors in S&amp;P 500 in 2020 typically move in opposite directions

Risky investments have rallied this year. So have safe ones.
The tug of war across financial markets shows just how divided the outlook among investors is as they struggle to assess the economic toll of the growing coronavirus epidemic.
Within the stock market, the two best-performing sectors in the S&P 500 in 2020 have been technology and utilities. That is notable because the two groups often move in opposite directions—with technology stocks rallying when investors feel confident in taking on riskier investments, and utilities and other safety stocks typically doing their best when money managers feel most skittish about economic prospects.
The S&P 500 tech sector is up 8.2% for the year, while utilities have risen 8.3%. Both groups have significantly outperformed the broader index, which has climbed 3.3% in 2020.
"It's a really polarized market," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Holdings. Even as the S&P 500 hangs within a few percentage points of its all-time high, "we have all of this money plowing into harbors of safety," he said.
Money managers and analysts had begun the year relatively optimistic about the global economy. Risky assets like stocks had even been relatively resilient through some spurts of selling related to the coronavirus epidemic, with analysts attributing the calm to investors' faith that the disease would be contained and that central banks would deploy enough stimulus to help offset a temporary pullback in growth.
But in recent days, that confidence has shown signs of faltering—with defensive parts of the stock market, as well as the price of other havens like gold and U.S. Treasurys racing higher. The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury slipped to a record low Friday. Yields fall as bond prices rise. Gold, meanwhile, jumped 1.7%, ending at its highest level since February 2013.
Analysts have attributed the moves to growing fears that the coronavirus epidemic will disrupt consumer spending, manufacturing and supply chains around the world more than investors had first expected. Many firms' initial estimates of the epidemic's impact on growth had assumed that the disease would be contained within the first couple months of the year. But in recent weeks, reports have shown the number of cases continuing to jump around the world, and multinationals like Apple Inc. have warned that their sales would take a hit because of a pullback in consumer spending.
With that kind of dim outlook, investors might typically retreat from risky assets overall. But faith that U.S. multinationals—particularly big tech companies—are resilient enough to withstand a temporary slowdown in global growth has helped keep those shares higher.
Even with Friday's pullback, Netflix Inc. is up 17% for the year. Alphabet Inc. has risen 11%, while Microsoft Corp. is up 13%.
It is difficult to imagine the disconnect being sustainable for long, Mr. Hogan said.
"Are we really pricing in recession fears? Or are people just so nervous they'll pay for anything with yield?" he said.

Quarantined: Reporting on an Epidemic Under China's Watchful Eye; Three Wall Street Journal reporters experienced the scope of the Chinese government's response to a deadly viral epidemic

This article is based on the experiences of Wall Street Journal reporters Stephanie Yang, Shan Li and James T. Areddy, as recounted by Ms. Yang.
Arriving at a hotel on Jan. 26 in a city about 200 miles from Wuhan, our plan was set. My colleague Shan Li and I would leave in the early-morning darkness the following day, traveling by car into the city to report from the center of a deadly viral epidemic.
Almost immediately, we were visited by hotel staff and local officials, who brought a warning: Go back to Beijing or face lockdown.
They never told us how they knew we were there, though foreign visitors like us have to show passports when checking into Chinese hotels. We are both U.S. citizens who are credentialed to work as journalists in China, where we are based in The Wall Street Journal's Beijing bureau.

Stephanie, front, and Shan's first night at the hotel in Xiangyang, Hubei, getting ready for their last walk around outside—though they didn't know it at the time. PHOTO: Stephanie Yang/The Wall Street Journal
For days afterward, authorities blocked us from leaving the hotel, and later our rooms, and checked on our health constantly. A young man monitored us from a room across the hallway, even following Shan down to the lobby at 3 a.m. one night in yellow-and-black pajamas.
The coronavirus epidemic, which has infected more than 75,000 world-wide and killed more than 2,200 people in China alone , is an unprecedented test of Chinese leader Xi Jinping's government and the vast surveillance state China has built over the last five years under his rule.
Never before has a nation tried to put so many people—more than 60 million—under full-time quarantine. Hundreds of millions more are being discouraged from leaving their homes.
Others are being tracked by China's leviathan surveillance system, which uses facial recognition and other technologies to monitor people's movements. Checkpoints have been set up to keep people from driving freely in and out of towns or leaving their apartment complexes. Neighborhood-watch captains are keeping tabs on residents everywhere. Some drugstores have been required to report sales of fever and cough medicine to track down potential patients.
Our Shanghai-based reporter, Jim Areddy, also experienced the reach of the government's response to the epidemic. Within a day of returning home from a reporting trip to Wuhan in late January, his wife got a call from a neighborhood policeman, and he got a text message from the local government. Both indicated his trip was a problem.
The text message told Jim, who is a U.S. citizen, to promptly report his presence and ended with a slogan: "Let's work together to safeguard the health of citizens and the safety of the city!" It didn't say how they knew where he had been.

He was told to remain in his apartment for 14 days as a precaution to prevent the spread of the virus. Each day, the chief of his building's Communist Party neighborhood committee—the front line to enforcing policies such as fire regulations and trash separation—stopped by or sent an underling. Other visitors came by in goggles and hazmat suits. A woman in surgical garb and gloves, who identified herself as Dr. Zhong, instructed him to put his signature on a form promising to remain housebound.
When Jim struggled to recall his flight number from Wuhan, he says a man with her who didn't identify himself provided it.
The only time Jim ventured outside, at 2 a.m. one morning to toss out the garbage, he hunched under his hoodie to avoid lobby surveillance cameras. The next morning, visitors in space suits with disinfectant spray bottles knocked on his door requesting his trash.
Of course, all three of us were fortunate compared with the tens of thousands of people who have the virus, and the millions more who face restrictions that are hurting their ability to earn wages, obtain necessities like medicines, and visit loved ones. Human-rights groups have decried China's coronavirus clampdown, arguing it unnecessarily impinges on people's rights and slows the free movement of drugs and supplies without necessarily stopping the virus.
From our vantage point, it is hard to tell what the final impact of China's massive quarantine policy on the virus will be. But it is difficult to imagine any other nation being able to control the movements of so many people. And it is clear the controls are generating fear and paranoia.

For Shan and me, our quarantine began in late January. Unable to enter Wuhan directly because it was under lockdown, we flew to the city of Nanyang, 250 miles to the northwest, with plans to approach Wuhan through Hubei province by train and by car. Even in Nanyang, cars were already sparse. A taxi driver who agreed to take us to the local train station warned us against going further. "Just turn around and go home," he said.
We made it by train to Xiangyang, the third most populous city in Hubei province. We checked into a hotel and planned to push on in a hired car later.
Soon after our arrival, however, hotel staff and local authorities started showing up at our doors. One was a man named Wang Jianjun, deputy director of the Foreign Affairs Office of Xiangyang's government.
"Given the circumstances, let's not shake hands," he said, holding his hands up. Saying the situation in Hubei was dire, he then pleaded with us to leave while we still could. "I would tell my own daughters to do the same," he said.
The authorities gave us an out: A train would be able to take us to Chengdu, where we could fly back to Beijing.
Still determined to do our reporting, we declined the offer. "Then you need to understand that you will not be able to leave the hotel at all," one of the officials snapped.
By that night, all hotel guests—including families with young children—were under a mandatory 14-day quarantine. Guards were stationed at the exits to keep anyone from leaving.
It became clear we were under surveillance. The door to the room across from Shan's was propped ajar with a deadbolt, the only one that was always open in the hallway. The young man inside followed us when we left our rooms.
We decided to make the best of the situation and keep reporting. But whenever we attempted to interview other guests, we were reprimanded and followed, with one hotel staffer telling us we might be mistaken for prostitutes. The hotel printed out a new notice, delivered personally to our door, asking guests not to interact with each other, for their own health and safety.
While we were speaking with a pair of Danish men in the cafe downstairs, four officials came over to tell us that, to prevent contagion, guests were no longer allowed to sit at the same table. When one of the Danish men offered to move to the next table, the officials said the entire cafe would be shut down.
Hotel staff and members of a local virus-control committee came to our rooms to check our temperatures—at least once every four hours. We felt fine for our entire stay. But one day, we clocked in at over 37 degrees Celsius, or just slightly above 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and tensions started rising.
Fearing it was a sign of infection, our visitors grew increasingly wary around us. No longer willing to measure our temperatures in person, one dropped off two thermometers in a glove, rang the doorbell, sprayed at us with disinfectant, pointed at the floor and scurried away. Everyone wore gloves and pushed food into the room on carts instead of bringing it in. That day they asked for temperature checks every 90 minutes. They insisted we go to the hospital. After we refused, we were no longer allowed to leave our rooms.
Mr. Wang, the Foreign Affairs Office representative, called Shan to ask if we had perhaps caught a cold. We reassured him we were OK.

One day, someone dropped off two thermometers in a glove, rang the doorbell and sprayed at them with disinfectant before running away. PHOTO: Shan Li/The Wall Street Journal
Still, for the next few days we stifled any urge to sneeze or cough in front of hotel staff and debated how they might interpret our food orders. What would a healthy person eat? We weren't so worried about getting sick as giving the appearance of being sick, since that could land us in a hospital, surrounded by coronavirus patients.
Mr. Wang suggested we apply for a spot on an evacuation flight out of Wuhan being offered by the U.S. State Department for U.S. citizens and their families, to be followed by a 14-day quarantine in the U.S. If we could verify our spot, he said he could help us drive past checkpoints between Xiangyang and Wuhan.
When Shan asked whether he could instead help us get back to Beijing via Henan, a province north of Wuhan city, he laughed and said those borders were closed. "At this point, it would be easier to leave the country than it would be to drive into Henan."
Then Mr. Wang rang again. This time, he warned us we would be confined to the hotel even after the 14-day quarantine was over. As part of lockdown protocol, he said, restrictions were tightening for everyone in the city. Neighborhoods were being barricaded. Communities could only send out one person every few days to buy supplies. 
After 11 days of confinement together, Shan and Stephanie prepared to board different evacuation flights and undergo another 14-day quarantine—alone. PHOTO: Stephanie Yang/The Wall Street Journal
The city's quarantine had no end date, he said. After two weeks, we could leave our rooms, but not the hotel itself.
"This is not to restrict your freedom," he said. "But we are serving the country and the people, and limiting the flow of people is the only way."
That decided it for us: a two-week quarantine in the U.S. over an indefinite one in China.
After a mad dash to catch the last of the evacuation flights, we arrived on American soil . I landed at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, while Shan wound up at Travis Air Force Base near Sacramento.
Our colleague Jim's quarantine at his apartment in China ended on Feb. 6, two weeks after it began. Ours in the U.S. ended on Thursday, after a total 25 days in quarantine.
In China, millions of people and entire cities remain under lockdown and quarantine, as the country tries to stem the spread of infections.

The world's biggest container shipping line is racing to withdraw capacity as fast as business demand is falling. A.P. Moeller-Maersk Chief Executive Soren Skou says Maersk Line has pulled more than 50 scheduled sailings from its China services since late January, the WSJ's Costas Paris and Dominic Chopping report, part of the broader retrenchment of shipping services in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak . The company's large scale leaves it heavily exposed to the steep decline in China volumes since Beijing imposed an extraordinary series of restrictions aimed at restricting the spread of the virus. Factory output remains weak, but Mr. Skou says transport barriers within China are hampering exports as well since truck drivers face big hurdles in moving goods to ports. That could add to Maersk's financial pain this year after the carrier unveiled a surprise $72 million net loss in the quarter ending Dec. 31.
TRANSPORTATION
A standoff on Canada's freight rail tracks is starting to bite into the country's economy. The two-week-old blockade of rail lines by protestors of a proposed natural-gas pipeline is stranding key shipments and snarling supply chains, the WSJ's Paul Vieira reports, triggering layoffs in some operations and raising alarms at factories and export centers I. Canadian National Railway is laying off 450 workers while shipping customers scramble for scarce alternatives. One logistics broker says freight rates for trucks have climbed as much as 20% since the protests began for those shippers that can secure road transport. Food-packaging provider CKF Inc. says the blockades "have caused some supply-chain chaos," but the company is eating the higher costs to keep customers satisfied. Economists say the stoppages threaten to shave 0.1% to 0.3% from Canada's economic output this month, but the damage could grow the longer the interruption continues.
COMMODITIES
There's no escape in the kitchen from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Prices for garlic are jumping to the highest levels in two years, the WSJ's Lucy Craymer reports, because of disruptions in supply from China, the world's biggest producer of the aromatic bulbs. The rising garlic costs contrast with a more general downturn in agriculture prices because of dimming demand in China, highlighting the fractured impact of the outbreak on trade flows. Garlic production in China has slowed since authorities sounded alarms over the spread of the virus in late January. Because garlic takes nine months to grow, the recent price increases may be the first taste of still higher prices over the coming year. One of America's largest garlic producers and suppliers says it has reached out to growers in other countries to mitigate big increases in wholesale prices.

Saudis Weigh Breaking Oil Alliance With Russia as Virus Crimps Demand; Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the U.A.E. will discuss a possible collective output cut of as much as 300,000 barrels a day

Saudi Arabia is considering a break from its four-year oil-production alliance with Russia, according to people familiar with the matter, as China's coronavirus outbreak contributes to a drop in global oil demand.
The Saudi kingdom, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates—which collectively represent over half of OPEC's production capacity—are holding talks this week to discuss a possible joint output cut of as much as 300,000 barrels a day, said the people.
The coronavirus outbreak has created a rift in the partnership between Russia and the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The two sides have collaborated since December 2016 in an effort to balance global oil supply amid a surge of crude from U.S. shale producers. If the Saudis, Kuwait and the U.A.E. break with the Russians, the split could further weaken OPEC's ability to influence oil prices.
The new tensions come ahead of the group's early March gathering in Vienna, where it aims to reach a consensus on how much crude to deliver to an already oversupplied market.
At an emergency meeting earlier in February, Russia rejected a Saudi push to deepen the alliance's existing oil production curbs by 600,000 barrels a day.
Russian officials still don't see a need for reductions, the people familiar with the matter said. Russian delegates say business activity in China is recovering and the impact of the virus on oil demand is limited, the people said.
Saudi exports to China have remained stable since the crisis began, though sales from other OPEC members have shown weakness, according to commodities-data provider Kpler.
Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has compared the virus's effect on oil demand to a fire that needs to be put out, according to a person familiar with the matter. In one option under consideration, Saudi Arabia and its two Persian Gulf neighbors would reduce production without coordinating with a group of 10 non-OPEC nations led by Russia.
The divergence of opinion over coronavirus's effect on oil demand goes beyond OPEC. The International Energy Agency warned Feb. 13 that demand for oil is likely to be 435,000 barrels a day less in the current quarter compared with a year ago. Vitol Group, the world's largest independent oil trader, cut its forecast demand for the quarter to 98.3 million barrels a day, down 2.2 million barrels a day from its previous forecast for the period. Under either scenario, a quarterly decline would be the first since the height of the global financial crisis.
However, Moscow says weakened demand would be offset by reduced supply resulting from Libya's oil shutdown and new sanctions targeting Venezuela's crude sales, one person familiar with the matter said.
Libya's oil output has fallen to 120,000 barrels a day from 1.2 million daily barrels since a renegade general shut pipelines and oil ports in January in a dispute with the central government.
The U.S. on Tuesday imposed sanctions on a subsidiary of Russian state-run company Rosneft Oil Co. that had become the main marketer of banned Venezuelan crude. The new restrictions could cut Venezuelan exports by 600,000 barrels a day, said energy consulting firm FGE, which sees the market tightening by June as a result of the Libyan and Venezuelan disruptions.
"Russia's arguments for doing nothing may have some validity," it said.

TOKYO -- Japanese officials defended their handling of cruise-ship virus victims after the first two passenger deaths were reported -- one a woman in her 80s who had a fever for a week before getting to a hospital.
South Korea, meanwhile, reported its first death from the Covid-19 coronavirus, while confirmed cases began to mount in Beijing and Iran announced emergency measures Thursday to stem the spread of the virus there after two people diagnosed with the illness died in the central city of Qom.
Japan's Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament the two fatalities from the Diamond Princess cruise ship "received the best medical treatment" but couldn't be saved after catching the coronavirus on board. As of Thursday, 634 passengers and crew members were diagnosed with the virus out of 3,063 tested. Slightly more than half have no symptoms at all, officials said, and many of the remainder have only mild fever or a cough. On Thursday, 28 virus-positive patients were reported in serious condition.
Doctors have said the virus can be particularly harmful in elderly patients, and one of the two fatal cases from the Diamond Princess, a Japanese man in his 80s, had pre-existing bronchial asthma and had been treated for angina. The other, a Japanese woman in her 80s without underlying illnesses, came down with a fever on Feb. 5, according to health ministry officials. The next day, she started suffering from diarrhea and saw a doctor on board.
She wasn't taken to a hospital until Feb. 12 when she started suffering shortness of breath. Her virus test came back positive, and despite treatment with antiviral drugs, she died Thursday.
Asked about the woman's case, health ministry official Hiroshi Umeda said, "I believe it was handled promptly." He said the ship was a difficult environment for medical staff but they worked day and night and tried to prioritize the most serious cases.
The ship, which docked in Yokohama after a two-week tour of East Asia, had 3,700 passengers and crew aboard when it arrived in Japan but is gradually emptying out. The U.S., Australia, and other countries have laid on flights repatriating some of their citizens. Those diagnosed with the virus have been brought to hospitals, mostly in the Tokyo area, while more than 700 passengers who tested negative for the virus and didn't have symptoms disembarked on Wednesday and Thursday.
Crew members remain on board the Diamond Princess, apart from those who have tested positive, and some passengers are still quarantined on board if they shared a room with someone who tested positive.
Kentaro Iwata, a Kobe University infectious-diseases specialist, drew widespread attention on Wednesday when he said the ship should be evacuated more quickly and criticized the government's handling of quarantine procedures on board.
On Thursday, he took down two YouTube videos in English and Japanese in which he described the situation on board as scary, saying the government responded to his criticism by clarifying the demarcation between potentially contaminated "red zones" and noncontaminated "green zones."
Concerns are growing in South Korea about the spread of the virus there after a surge in infections centered on a church in the southern city of Daegu, which had dozens of the country's more than 200 cases as of Thursday.
In mainland China, 75,465 people had been confirmed as infected as of Thursday, including 2,236 deaths, China's National Health Commission said.
Wang Chen, a respiratory expert and vice president at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said in an interview with state broadcaster China Central Television on Wednesday that the new virus could circulate much as the flu does, and for longer than the SARS virus did in 2002 and 2003.
Most of the cases and deaths globally have been in China's central Hubei province, where the epidemic began.
Nearly 60 million people remain quarantined in Hubei. Companies won't be allowed to restart work until March 11 unless their business is tied to basic needs such as infrastructure, producing medical equipment and providing food, the provincial government said Thursday. That pushes back the previous resumption date of Feb. 21, likely adding to the pain felt by many auto makers that have production sites in Wuhan, Hubei's capital, including General Motors Co. and Honda Motor Co.
Outside Hubei, many exporters started to resume production Feb. 10 after an extended Lunar New Year holiday, the Commerce Ministry said.
Foxconn Technology Group, Apple Inc.'s biggest iPhone assembler, said Thursday that it expects the epidemic to reduce its revenue.
Earlier this week, Apple warned that it won't meet its revenue projections for the current quarter, saying the coronavirus epidemic was limiting iPhone production and reducing demand in China.

Oil prices edged higher Thursday, preserving a recent recovery after weekly inventory figures showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose less than expected last week, quelling some fears about the impact of the coronavirus.
U.S. crude futures closed up 0.9% at $53.78 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, posting their highest close since Jan. 24 and trimming some of their recent slide. Prices are still well below a peak hit Jan. 6 amid worries that lower fuel demand in Asia as a result of the fallout from the coronavirus will result in a glut.
Oil pared some of its earlier Thursday advance as stocks fell in midday trading and safe-haven assets such as gold and bonds rallied. The dollar also extended a recent surge with traders seeking shelter in investments more tied to the U.S. economy, challenging commodities like oil that are denominated in the currency by making them more expensive for overseas buyers.
Brent crude, the global gauge of oil prices, rose 0.3% to $59.31 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange.
Analysts have been anticipating deeper production cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, easing some worries about excess supply.
Although domestic oil stockpiles rose for the fourth consecutive week during the week ended Feb. 14, the Energy Information Administration's report showed inventories increased by 415,000 barrels, a much smaller rise than the 3.4-million barrel climb expected by analysts and traders surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.
Additionally, stockpiles of gasoline and distillates, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, declined.
Analysts are looking to coming data points to gauge whether the market will be oversupplied moving forward. Crude inventories were just 2% below the five-year average for this time of year at the end of last week, Thursday's report showed. Plentiful stockpiles in other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations have also limited oil-price gains.
Elsewhere in commodities Thursday, natural-gas prices extended a recent stretch of volatility by erasing a morning surge to close down 1.8% at $1.920 a million British thermal units.

David Huang couldn't be more grateful to be back in the United States, after landing a seat on an evacuation flight out of Wuhan, China, during the coronavirus lockdown.
But the 30-year-old postal worker from Seattle wasn't expecting the two-week quarantine that followed to be an alcohol-free zone. "I have to drink red wine every day, at least one glass a day," he said.
Red wine was one item U.S. government officials hadn't stocked up on for Mr. Huang's federally mandated sojourn at Travis Air Force Base, about 50 miles northeast of San Francisco. He befriended a worker at the site, who slipped him four miniature bottles of vodka hidden in latex gloves. He savored it over four nights.
The U.S. has quarantined hundreds of Americans returning from the center of the coronavirus epidemic in China. While those quarantined expressed relief and gratitude, the unprecedented public-health measure has also resulted in some unexpected hiccups.
Dr. Henry Walke of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said many questions at Travis at first revolved around medical worries, such as the possibility of infecting family and friends. That was to be expected, health officials said. Less expected: Evacuees' questions about getting some slippers. After a large order of slippers yielded only about 80 pairs, all in a size medium, the front desk workers had to sternly remind people to take one pair each.
More than 800 people have been evacuated to the U.S. from China's Hubei province, where the coronavirus epidemic originated. So far, the virus has killed more than 2,100 people, mostly in China, and infected more than 75,000 globally.
Everyone evacuated is required to undergo a 14-day quarantine, most of which wrapped up this week. Another 300-some evacuees recently arrived in the U.S. from the Diamond Princess cruise ship and are scheduled to finish their quarantines in early March. Two reporters from The Wall Street Journal were among those quarantined, one at Travis, in Fairfield, Calif., and one at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego.
Evacuees are housed on military bases in hotel rooms or in temporary lodging.
As worry recedes, boredom sets in.
Pan Jiang, a clothing-store saleswoman from Portland, Ore., amused herself by walking around the hotel grounds at Travis dressed in one of the four ball gowns packed in her suitcase. One day, it was a pale green number with a beaded leaf design. The following day, she opted for a blue floor-length dress featuring an extravagantly ruffled skirt. "I'm so bored here." Ms. Jiang said. "There's nothing to do."
The 27-year-old said she hoped to cheer up her fellow evacuees by putting on a daily fashion show amid the lush grass and blue skies of Northern California. "It's a reminder of how lucky we are to have gotten out," she added.
In quarantine circles, food is a perennial topic of conversation. In an evacuee chat group, a request for garlic was greeted with a clapping hands emoji and the phrase "that's so good" in Chinese. At Miramar, one woman begged for any kind of hot sauce to eat with the meals. The next morning, sriracha and soy sauce were added to the breakfast table.
"It's like, leftover airplane food," said 33-year-old Blair Zong, who stocked up on Nacho Cheese Doritos, Godiva chocolates and frozen Kung Pao chicken on her second day in quarantine via Amazon. (Packages can be delivered to the warehouse on base.)
Luanettee Colebrooke, a 31-year-old doctoral candidate from Wuhan, likes to share photos of new dishes whipped up by remixing ingredients. Among her creations: a sandwich made by tucking scrambled eggs into a croissant from lunch, and parfaits using granola bars crumbled on the breakfast fruit cup and yogurt.
Some expressed reluctance to voice complaints or make unwieldy requests, out of appreciation for the staff and volunteers. Lodging and meals are provided free of charge.
Dan Houlihan, emergency management specialist with the Administration of Children and Families, said the CDC has been able to fulfill requests for basic necessities such as toiletries and baby formula. Condoms were deemed a necessity and supplied by the San Diego department of public health. An adult skateboard that was requested, he said, was not.
Kimmy McDaniel, co-founder of Project Strong One, which has supplied provisions, said she went to four different grocery stores in her hunt for a specific Chinese brand of chili oil. Evacuees applauded when she dropped off frozen dumplings, then later puzzled over how exactly to cook them without dinnerware or stoves.
At Travis, a game of kickball was put on hold while a U.S. Marshal went to retrieve the ball from out-of-quarantine-bounds. An outdoor showing of "Frozen" was arranged for Valentine's Day -- with moviegoers spaced out in accordance with the 6-foot distance requirement.
At Miramar, a Marine band played patriotic marches and jazz classics for a crowd that cheered and took photos through two separate fences.
"That was the weirdest concert I've ever been to," said Kevin Schlei, a composer and electronic musician from Wisconsin. "And I went to a concert in an abandoned milk factory."

Currencies: Dollar Advances Against Yen for Second Session

The dollar rose sharply against the yen for a second straight session Thursday, fueling discussion about a shift in currency markets.
The dollar climbed 0.7% against the yen to 112.11 yens per dollar, building off a 1.4% gain on Wednesday.
Though hard-pressed to explain the magnitude of its decline, analysts attributed the yen's weakness to several factors, including disappointing Japanese economic data and solid U.S. figures.
According to a report released early this week, Japan's economy contracted at an annualized rate of 6.3% in the October-December quarter. That was worse than economists' forecast of a 3.9% decline and raised the possibility that the world's third-largest economy could slip into a recession this quarter.
At the same time, U.S. economic reports -- including those on employment and manufacturing activity -- have largely been beating expectations. And many investors are concerned that Japan's economy could be particularly exposed to the coronavirus.
"Suddenly with very poor economic data and coronavirus fears, I think the market is looking at the possibility, or at least the risk, that you get a technical recession in Japan," said Brian Daingerfield, head of G10 FX Strategy for the U.S. at NatWest Markets, referring to the potential for two straight quarters of economic contraction. That in turn could push the Bank of Japan to adopt new stimulus measures, which could weigh on the yen, he added.
This week's move in the yen is noteworthy because the currency has, for many years, served as a haven for investors -- strengthening during times of political and economic uncertainty and weakening when optimism grows.
Some analysts, though, say they believe the dollar could challenge the yen as a haven. One reason is that the U.S. is relatively insulated from the rest of the world because exports account for a small share of its economic output.

World News: Iranians Vote Amid Strains at Home, Abroad

TEHRAN -- Iran's leadership is pushing for a high turnout at Friday's parliamentary elections, as conservatives seek to consolidate power in the face of mounting economic challenges at home and worsening tensions with the U.S.
Many Iranians are threatening to boycott the vote after a large number of moderate and reformist candidates were disqualified, with some expressing frustration over the legislature's failure to address concerns such as the country's flagging economy or strict Islamic laws.
"I won't be part of the show as long as I can't see my favorite candidate who I genuinely support and believe in. I won't choose between bad and worse anymore," said a 53-year-old homemaker here in the capital.
Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, elections have been an important way for Iran's establishment to build consensus at home and create an outward display of strength, said Sanam Vakil, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House, a London think tank. Among its other tasks, the legislature passes laws and can challenge government policy, in addition to impeaching ministers.
"The fact that Iran has elections, albeit managed ones, is used to demonstrate that the Islamic Republic is more legitimate than other countries in the region," she said.
That image is especially important now, experts say. In November, Iranian authorities violently suppressed a wave of protests over the country's economic woes, which have been aggravated by sanctions the U.S. imposed after pulling out of the 2015 nuclear deal. A second wave of unrest followed the Iranian military's downing of a Ukrainian airliner in January and itsattempt to cover it up.
Tehran has carefully selected which candidates are allowed to run for the 290 seats in the country's legislative assembly.
The Guardian Council, a 12-member body tasked with upholding Islamic law and supervising elections, assessed some 16,000 candidates who signed up to contest the ballot. Only around 7,200 were allowed to appear on ballots, the lowest approval rate in the history of the Islamic Republic. About one-fourthof the current lawmakers were among those banned from running.
President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate in Iran's political system, has complained that too many candidates were ruled out from his side of the aisle. But as a stalwart of the Islamic Republic, he has urged Iranians to cast their ballots to stand "against the global imperialism for our children."
"We should know that our mass presence and enthusiastic queues . . . will upset America, while our absence will make America happy," he said in a cabinet meeting broadcast on state television.
Social-media users, imprisoned activists and Iranians abroad have led the boycott calls. A recent poll by the nongovernmental Iranian Students Polling Agency said only 21% of residents in Tehran plan to vote. A recent outbreak of the coronavirus here may also hurt the election turnout. Authorities on Thursday announced emergency measures in the central city of Qom after the death of two people diagnosed with Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.
"Compared to the past, this time there is not much enthusiasm about the elections," said Hamidreza Jalaeipour, a lecturer in political sociology at Tehran University.

U.S. equities slumped on concern that the coronavirus that originated in China will take a heavy toll on corporate earnings. The dollar jumped and gold climbed to a seven-year high as investors sought havens.
Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc. and other big tech names led losses after Japan reported two deaths and South Korea confirmed its first fatality from the disease amid a report the illness was spreading in Beijing.
ViacomCBS Inc. tumbled after sales missed estimates, while Morgan Stanley dropped after agreeing to buy E-Trade Financial Corp. for $13 billion.
The S&P 500 index pared the worst of its decline in the afternoon amid gains for automakers and real estate companies.
The yen extended its fall amid disappointing economic news and early positioning before the fiscal year-end next month.
Treasurys rallied.
Sentiment turned negative Thursday, a day after equities reached record highs, as the infection that originated in China continues to expand beyond the mainland.
Earnings misses are adding to the gloom, alongside fresh warnings on the pathogen's impact from A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world's largest container shipping firm, and Air France-KLM.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s chief equity strategist said a near-term correction for the stock market is looking more probable.
"It could be some larger players hedging against downside risk of the coronavirus spreading," said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. "That, on top of the Goldman call that a correction is more likely, has people on edge."
Elsewhere, subpar results from AXA and Telefonica weighed on European equity gauges.

USDA: China might purchase much less U.S. farm product than expected

President Trump's promise in January that China would purchase roughly $40 billion in U.S. agriculture products this year faced new questions on Thursday when a top government economist suggested a much smaller haul could occur, adding uncertainty to a key part of a partial trade deal.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief economist, Robert Johansson, projected that agricultural exports to China would reach roughly $14 billion in the year that ends Sept. 30, a $4 billion increase from one year ago.
But that amount would still fall far short of what White House officials said would take place based on the recently announced 'Phase One' trade deal with Chinese leaders. White House officials have said agricultural exports to China would be between $40 billion and $50 billion in each of the next two years. Last year, when he was promising the trade deal would lead to a huge increase in purchases, Trump told farmers to buy 'more land' and 'bigger tractors.'
The comments were made at the USDA's Agricultural Outlook Forum. At a news conference later at the event, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said that enforcing China's purchase commitments in the trade deal remained a concern and that variables such as the coronavirus outbreak made predictions difficult. The next World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) projections will not include 'Phase One' China purchase commitments, Johansson has said.
USDA officials said it couldn't be clear how much U.S. farm product China will ultimately buy this year.
Details about Chinese agricultural purchase commitments in 'Phase One' were fairly specific: China was to ensure additional purchases of U.S. agriculture products by $32 billion over two years, $12.5 billion in 2020 over the 2017 baseline of $24 billion and $19.5 billion over that baseline in 2021. This would mean total agricultural and seafood exports to China in 2020 would be $36.5 billion and up to $43.5 billion in 2021.
'The question we get is why the numbers aren't matching up,' Johansson said Thursday by phone. 'When the secretary [Perdue] was asked this question, he said, 'We're not just taking the additional $30 billion and sticking it into a Chinese export number.' '
Some of the discrepancy, he said, is the difference between a calendar year and a fiscal year " meaning October, November and December numbers were not included in the projection.
'Does that mean we expect those three months to fill that gap?' Johansson asked. 'Our analysts are looking at the market and looking at the books: What is China's demand? . . . My job is to ask if it's feasible that they meet these commitments.'
There are dramatic variables and big unknowns, such as record crop harvests in Brazil and the effects of the covid-19 virus. A devastating outbreak of African swine fever last year that killed more than a quarter of China's total herd has meant American pork is poised to export a lot of product to meet demand. But the coronavirus outbreak could scuttle that, Johansson said.
'Coronavirus is reducing Quarter One economic growth,' he said. 'Our assumption is that the outbreak is going to pass and their growth will respond in the second, third and fourth quarters.'
Trump began imposing tariffs on Chinese imports because he said there was a major trade imbalance between the two countries, alleging that China needed to import more U.S. products, particularly from farmers. China retaliated by raising tariffs on U.S. farm products, and many farmers said they were caught in the crossfire. Farm bankruptcies increased and commodity prices fell, making the pain even more acute. Trump authorized two large, multibillion-dollar bailouts for farmers in an effort to try to address concerns, but he also said the recent trade deal with China would move to dramatically improve their livelihoods.
More broadly, Johansson said that total U.S. agricultural exports should reach $139.5 billion in 2020, up $4 billion from 2019, largely on the strength of trade agreements with Mexico, Canada and Japan.

Trump advisers: 3% growth unlikely

Infrastructure package, more tax cuts unlikely to pass in divided Congress 
President Trump's top economists predict the U.S. economy will not grow at a rate of 3 percent or higher this year unless Congress enacts a major infrastructure package and additional tax cuts.
Passage of legislation addressing either area appears unlikely in the run-up to the presidential election because Democrats control the House of Representatives. Instead, many economists forecast that the economy will grow around 2 percent this year.
In the annual Economic Report of the President released on Thursday, Trump's Council of Economic Advisers predicts that if the president and Congress do not make further policy changes, the U.S. economy will grow at a 2.4-percent annual pace this year and at a 2.3 percent pace in 2021. That kind of growth is well below what Trump promised and similar to what occurred under President Barack Obama.
The report is the latest acknowledgment by the Trump administration that the economy is unlikely to grow at 3 percent or faster, a goal Trump has yet to achieve in his presidency.
The economy grew 2.3 percent last year, 2.9 percent in 2018 and 2.4 percent in 2017, according to the Commerce Department.
Trump's large tax cut and his increase in federal spending lifted growth in 2018, but it has since moderated, especially after the president escalated his trade wars. Business leaders were spooked by Trump's fondness for tariffs on goods from China and other nations and pulled back sharply on investments in factories and equipment, creating a drag on growth.
To achieve faster growth, Trump's Council of Economic Advisers says, there would need to be more deregulation, immigration reform, passage of an infrastructure plan, more trade deals, incentives to get more Americans working and permanent tax cuts for American households (the corporate tax cuts that Republicans passed at the end of 2017 are permanent, but the individual tax cuts are set to expire after 2025). Most of these policy changes require Congress's help, an unlikely scenario as long as Democrats control at least one chamber of Congress.
Many of the policy changes would also come with high price tags. Trump's economists predict that the federal deficit will top $1-trillion this year. The deficit has risen nearly 50 percent since Trump took office.
Still, growth at around 2-percent is likely to be enough to keep the economy healthy and keep businesses steadily adding jobs every month. Goldman Sachs predicts that the unemployment rate will fall this year to 3.25-percent, a level not seen in more than 65 years.
The vast majority of Americans say this is the best economy since the late 1990s. Independent voters and less-affluent voters are increasingly likely to give the economy high marks, which should help Trump as he seeks reelection.
'Growth has accelerated since the election in 2016, more than seven years into the recovery. This acceleration occurred despite monetary policies,' said Tomas Philipson, the acting head of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers.
The White House has repeatedly accused the Federal Reserve of hurting growth, although most economists say the central bank's interest rate cuts last year helped prevent a major slowdown.
Trump and top White House officials argued that the faster growth seen in 2018 would last, but many independent forecasters characterized it as a temporary sugar high from the stimulus measures. The White House also predicted a boom in business investment after the tax cuts, but that has not materialized. Business investment outside of home building shrank for much of last year.
'Initially, we saw a huge surge in investment. Once we got a renegotiation of trade agreements, we saw uncertainty in the market, and investment took a hit,' Philipson said.
Philipson predicted a jump in business investment this year, but that is likely to hinge on trade policy and better global growth. Last year brought the slowest global growth since the Great Recession, another factor making business leaders nervous. Many big banks foresee a rebound this year, but the novel coronavirus is causing a substantial drag on the Chinese economy that is spilling over to nations including Japan, South Korea and Singapore.
This latest White House economic forecast does not take into account the impact of the coronavirus.

TEHRAN—Iran's leadership is pushing for a high turnout at Friday's parliamentary elections, as conservatives seek to consolidate power in the face of mounting economic challenges at home and worsening tensions with the U.S.
Many Iranians are threatening to boycott the vote after a large number of moderate and reformist candidates were disqualified, with some expressing frustration over the legislature's failure to address concerns such as the country's flagging economy or strict Islamic laws.
"I won't be part of the show as long as I can't see my favorite candidate who I genuinely support and believe in. I won't choose between bad and worse anymore," said a 53-year-old homemaker here in the capital.
Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, elections have been an important way for Iran's establishment to build consensus at home and create an outward display of strength, said Sanam Vakil, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House, a London think tank. Among its other tasks, the legislature passes laws and can challenge government policy, in addition to impeaching ministers.
"The fact that Iran has elections, albeit managed ones, is used to demonstrate that the Islamic Republic is more legitimate than other countries in the region," she said.
That image is especially important now, experts say. In November Iranian authorities violently suppressed a wave of protests over the country's economic woes, which have been aggravated by sanctions the U.S. imposed after pulling out of the 2015 nuclear deal. A second wave of unrest followed the Iranian military's downing of a Ukrainian airliner in January, and its attempt to cover it up.
Tehran has carefully selected which candidates are allowed to run for the 290 seats in the country's legislative assembly.
The Guardian Council, a 12-member body tasked with upholding Islamic law and supervising elections, assessed some 16,000 candidates who signed up to contest the ballot. Only around 7,200 were allowed to appear on ballots, the lowest approval rate in the history of the Islamic Republic. About one-fourth of the current lawmakers were among those banned from running.
President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate in Iran's political system, has complained that too many candidates were ruled out from his side of the aisle. But as a stalwart of the Islamic Republic, he has urged Iranians to cast their ballots to stand "against the global imperialism for our children," as he said Wednesday.
"We should know that our mass presence and enthusiastic queues…will upset America, while our absence will make America happy," he said in a cabinet meeting broadcast on state television.
Social-media users, imprisoned activists and Iranians abroad have led the boycott calls. A recent poll by the nongovernmental Iranian Students Polling Agency said only 21% of residents in Tehran plan to vote. A recent outbreak of the coronavirus here may also hurt the election turnout. Authorities on Thursday announced emergency measures in the central city of Qom after the death of two people diagnosed with Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.
"Compared to the past, this time there is not much enthusiasm about the elections," said Hamidreza Jalaeipour, a lecturer in political sociology at Tehran University. "The country has problems and it needs people's participation. Nobody is happy with foreign interference. It was far from wise to conduct such disqualifications."
Guardian Council spokesman Abbasali Kadkhodaei on Wednesday said the disqualifications weren't political. Sitting lawmakers were banned only for financial misdoings, moral issues or for acting against the interest of the Islamic Republic, he said.
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei this week called voting a religious duty. His comments resonate with some Iranians who consider turning out to vote on Friday.
"I vote because it's good for my country and for my future," said a 27-year-old man who lives in Tehran.
Other Iranians have swung behind the government after a U.S. airstrike killed Qassem Soleimani , Iran's most prominent military commander and a man widely viewed as a defender of the nation.
"We should show the enemy that no matter what, we support our country and leader," said Zahra, a 21-year-old student. "Not voting means we didn't care about Gen. Soleimani's blood and it's gone wasted."
Some voters complain that moderates don't achieve much even when they are elected. In the last election to the parliament in 2016, a bloc of reformists and centrists gained 41% of the seats, compared with 29% for hard-liners and conservatives and 28% for independents. Yet that moderate and reformist bloc has achieved little, some voters say.
"MPs who speak out against the system's radical policies haven't been able to change anything. So you tell me: Why bother?" said Bardia, a 42-year-old IT manager at a state-run company.
Yet by making Friday's election so partisan, some political analysts say, the regime might have missed an opportunity to build on the national outpouring of grief that followed Gen. Soleimani's death, which brought millions of people into the streets.
"This election was a chance for the political system to show it pays attention to public worries," said Mr. Jalaeipour, the lecturer.

Dollar Extends Gains Against Yen; Yen's decline came despite selling in U.S. stocks and a rally in Treasurys, a departure from the usual pattern

The dollar rose sharply against the yen for the second straight session Thursday, fueling discussion about a shift in currency markets.
The dollar climbed 0.7% against the yen to 112.11 yens per dollar, building off a 1.4% gain on Wednesday.
Though hard-pressed to explain the magnitude of its decline, analysts attributed the yen's weakness to several factors, including disappointing Japanese economic data and solid U.S. figures.
According to a report released early this week, Japan's economy contracted at an annualized rate of 6.3% in the October-December quarter. That was worse than economists' forecast of a 3.9% decline and raised the possibility that the world's third-largest economy could slip into a recession this quarter.
At the same time, U.S. economic reports—including those on employment and manufacturing activity—have largely been beating expectations. And many investors are concerned that Japan's economy could be particularly exposed to the coronavirus both because of its economic ties with China and the potential for the virus to spread in the country.
"Suddenly with very poor economic data and coronavirus fears, I think the market is looking at the possibility, or at least the risk, that you get a technical recession in Japan," said Brian Daingerfield, head of G10 FX Strategy for the U.S. at NatWest Markets, referring to the potential for two straight quarters of economic contraction. That in turn could push the Bank of Japan to adopt new stimulus measures, which could weigh on the yen, he added.
This week's move in the yen is noteworthy because the currency has, for many years, served as a haven for investors—strengthening during times of political and economic uncertainty and weakening when optimism grows.
Some analysts, though, say they believe the dollar could challenge the yen as a haven. One reason is that the U.S. is relatively insulated from the rest of the world because exports account for a small share of its economic output. Another is that U.S. government bonds generally yield more than bonds in Europe and Japan, making them an attractive place for investors around the world to park their money.
The yen's declines on Wednesday were coupled with gains in riskier assets such as stocks. But its move on Thursday came despite selling in stocks and a rally in U.S. Treasurys, a departure from the usual pattern.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 1.524%, according to Tradeweb, compared with 1.569% Wednesday. Yields fall when bond prices rise.
The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 other currencies, rose 0.4% to 92.55, its highest closing level since January 2017.

Oil Prices Extend Rebound After EIA Inventory Report; Weekly inventory figures showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose less than expected last week

Oil prices edged higher Thursday, preserving a recent recovery after weekly inventory figures showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose less than expected last week, quelling some fears about the impact of the coronavirus.
U.S. crude futures closed up 0.9% at $53.78 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, posting their highest close since Jan. 24 and trimming some of their recent slide. Prices are still well below a peak hit Jan. 6 amid worries that lower fuel demand in Asia as a result of the fallout from the coronavirus will result in a glut.
Oil pared some of its earlier Thursday advance as stocks fell in midday trading and safe-haven assets such as gold and bonds rallied.
The dollar also extended a recent surge with traders seeking shelter in investments more tied to the U.S. economy, challenging commodities like oil that are denominated in the currency by making them more expensive for overseas buyers.
Brent crude, the global gauge of oil prices, rose 0.3% to $59.31 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange.
Analysts have been anticipating deeper production cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, easing some worries about excess supply.
Thursday's inventory report in the U.S. could also calm some jitters about a glut. Although domestic oil stockpiles rose for the fourth consecutive week during the week ended Feb. 14, the Energy Information Administration's report showed inventories increased by 415,000 barrels, a much smaller rise than the 3.4-million barrel climb expected by analysts and traders surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.
Additionally, stockpiles of gasoline and distillates, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, declined.
Analysts are looking to coming data points to gauge whether the market will be oversupplied moving forward. Crude inventories were just 2% below the five-year average for this time of year at the end of last week, Thursday's report showed. Plentiful stockpiles in other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations have also limited oil-price gains in recent months.
Elsewhere in commodities Thursday, natural-gas prices extended a recent stretch of volatility by erasing a morning surge to close down 1.8% at $1.920 a million British thermal units. The decline pared some of the recent rebound in prices of the heating fuel since they hit a multiyear low earlier this month.
Thursday moves came after the natural-gas inventory report showed stockpiles dropped 151 billion cubic feet during the week ended Feb. 14, slightly more than the 147-bcf drop projected by analysts surveyed by The Journal. Cold weather forecasts have helped prices stabilize recently because frigid temperatures tend to lift demand for the heating fuel.
A mild winter and steady supply have dented prices in recent weeks, but as is the case with oil, some analysts said the early year slide in natural gas went too far. On the other hand, stockpiles are 35% above their levels from a year ago and 9.3% above their five-year average for this time of year, potentially limiting the rebound. And many analysts remain concerned that the coronavirus will lower consumption of natural gas.

Here's Something That You Will Think Stinks: High Garlic Prices; In recent years, China has been responsible for as much as 80% of the global garlic supply

Garlic prices are rising. The reason: the widening coronavirus outbreak is causing disruptions in the supply chain in China, the world's largest producer of the vegetable.
In recent years , China has been responsible for as much as 80% of the global garlic supply. More than two-thirds of the fresh garlic that the U.S. imports comes from China, according to the United Nations' Comtrade database.
U.S. retail prices of garlic are now at their highest levels since 2018, driven by concerns that supplies could run short in the coming months. A sleeve of garlic—which typically contains five bulbs—cost an average of $1.425 in stores during the first two weeks of February, up 29% from a year earlier, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Wholesale prices have jumped even more. A 30-pound bag of white Chinese garlic imported into California recently sold for $85 to $87, up 60% since the start of the year, USDA data showed. In contrast, prices for other agricultural commodities—like soybeans and cotton—have fallen because of expectations for lower Chinese demand.
Garlic production in China has slowed since authorities sounded alarms over the spread of a new pneumonia-causing virus just before the start of the Lunar New Year holiday in late January. The Chinese government extended its national holiday into February to discourage people from traveling long distances and coming into contact with infected people. Thus far, more than 74,000 people in China have contracted the respiratory virus, now known as Covid-19, which has caused more than 2,000 deaths.
Many transportation and shipping routes have been hindered by lockdowns in cities affected by the outbreak, in addition to quarantine measures in other areas. Farms and logistics companies are also facing labor shortages because millions of workers have yet to return to their jobs after the holiday, according to agricultural analysts.
It usually takes about nine months to grow garlic before it can be harvested, which typically happens once a year during the summer. The bulbs are then sold over the following year. A lot of the garlic is also chopped up, peeled or processed into dry flakes before it is sold.
China produced about 49 billion pounds of garlic in 2018, which is the most recent annual data available. Most of it was for domestic consumption, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
America imported 199 million fresh pounds of garlic that year. Of that, about 70% was sourced from China, according to U.N. Comtrade data.
The average American consumes about 2 pounds of garlic a year, according to a Michigan State University report . Garlic's flavor has been gaining popularity in the U.S., and it is commonly used in ethnic cuisines from Asia to the Mediterranean. Some people are also adding more garlic to their diets because they believe it has many health benefits .
Christopher Ranch, one of America's largest garlic producers and suppliers, grows about 100 million pounds of garlic a year on its farms in California. It also buys garlic from China and other countries and sells it under a different label.
The Gilroy, Calif.-based company has reached out to growers in Argentina, Mexico and Spain to source more garlic in light of the recent China price surge, said Ken Christopher, executive vice president and grandson of the farm's founder.
"It's hard to come by and…it's incredibly expensive," he said of Chinese garlic right now. In China, wholesale garlic prices rose 13% in the first two weeks of February versus the average price in January, according to government data.

Over the past year, American garlic farmers benefited from the U.S.-China trade war, especially after the U.S. increased the tariff on Chinese garlic to 25%.
Because the latter is cheaper to produce—due to low labor costs and fewer government regulations—American farmers historically had difficulty competing on prices with Chinese garlic sellers.
John Milan, who owns five U.S. farms that grow elephant garlic—a large variety that has a milder flavor—said tariffs helped buoy the prices of homegrown garlic. He expects prices to climb further this summer when he sells his next batch of crops.
The U.S. currently consumes more garlic than it produces—a result of a drop in the number of domestic garlic farms over the last few decades. Mr. Milan said all the garlic from his farms was sold within three months last year.
According to local media reports, Chinese citizens have been eating more garlic cloves during the coronavirus outbreak because they believe its medicinal and antibacterial properties could help prevent them from getting sick.
In 2003, during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, similar supply bottlenecks and demand surges drove prices of garlic and garlic products higher world-wide.
A major outbreak of swine flu in China in 2009 also saw garlic prices surging in the country, though some believe that was largely driven by speculators and a supply shortage.
The World Health Organization says that while garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the virus.

Dear Tom, 
Have weather conditions contributed to the coronavirus outbreak?
Jeff Calharn, Chicago 
Dear Jeff,
There appears to be no demonstrable link between flu occurrences and a particular year's weather. If there were, flu outbreaks would be expected to start in this country's northern states and work south, and it doesn't happen. Admitting that patterns of flu occurrence can be difficult to identify, occurring randomly and at different locations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does note an autumn and winter flu outbreak peak in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The coronavirus outbreak originated in Wuhan, China, in December and is spreading across the world. Thus far, cases in the U.S. have been limited to people who have visited China.

U.S. News: Fed Optimism Rose Before Virus Hit

WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials signaled growing optimism about the U.S. economy last month, before the coronavirus outbreak in China began to cloud prospects of firmer global growth in 2020.
Officials at the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting mostly "saw the distribution of risks to the outlook for economic activity as more favorable than at the previous meeting, although a number of downside risks remained prominent," according to minutes released Wednesday.
No sooner had the U.S. and China signed a deal that eased trade tensions last month than the coronavirus outbreak in China rekindled doubts about the global economy's prospects in 2020.
The minutes referred eight times to the coronavirus outbreak, with officials agreeing the potential for disruptions from the virus "warranted close watching."
The Fed cut its benchmark rate at three consecutive meetings last year, to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%, after judging that any chill to business spending from trade uncertainty threatened to worsen slowing global growth. Officials held the rate steady at their two most recent meetings, in December and January, and indicated no urgency to reverse the cuts.
Trade uncertainty last year complicated Fed officials' approach to setting interest rates because they try to forecast the most likely path for the economy while minimizing the potential to make errors that are costly to fix.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers last week the central bank will want to see evidence that disruptions stemming from China, the world's second-largest economy, are persistent and material for the U.S. economy before it would consider cutting interest rates.
"There's no way to be confident about anyone's assessment, and there are a range of assessments," he said.
China serves as the hub of global supply chains for numerous products, including cars and computer chips. Beijing has imposed quarantines that have idled factories, while air travel to the country has been curtailed.
Investors in interest-rate future markets increasingly expect the Fed to lower rates later this year. Fed officials have said it is too soon to determine.
"If the situation gets significantly worse and we start to see significant impact on the U.S. economy, then we'd have to think about accommodation. But I don't think we're at that point right now," said Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker during a moderated question-and-answer session last week.
The minutes said most officials last month were more confident that with solid economic growth and continued hiring, inflation would gradually return to the Fed's 2% target after the central bank's preferred inflation gauge ran closer to 1.6% last year.
But a few officials said they were less confident in this outlook because inflation had consistently defied forecasts of a return to 2%.
Separately, the manager of the Fed's open-market operations outlined a proposal to phase out two-week loans backed by government securities, called repurchase agreements, or repo, after April. By that point, officials expect the Fed will have sufficiently rebuilt reserve balances in the banking system to $1.5 trillion.

Public-health officials in the U.S. are striving to keep tabs on thousands of Americans who have quarantined themselves at home after returning from mainland China to curtail the new coronavirus, adding to an epidemic response that is straining already-stretched local departments.
More than 5,400 people had been asked to self-quarantine in California alone as of Feb. 14, according to the California Department of Public Health. Hundreds more are self-quarantining in Georgia, Washington state, Illinois, New York and other states.
Public-health officials are following directions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department to supervise these people, but many steps are being developed on the fly. States are using a variety of techniques to track people from calling in volunteers to sending text messages and using electronic registries.
These people are separate from the Americans who are under stricter federal quarantine, including those housed at four U.S. air bases and the 328 who were recently evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. So far, there have been 15 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the U.S., not including the potentially positive cases among those evacuated from the Diamond Princess. While health officials have investigated 479 people for the virus as of Wednesday, 412 tested negative, with 52 cases pending, according to the CDC.
While public-health authorities are experienced with isolating, contact tracing and quarantining people to contain infectious diseases, an attempt to monitor and quarantine people at this scale is a unique challenge. And quarantines typically apply only to those with a known exposure to a virus, rather than just travel history, public-health officials say. "That's a whole new scope of work," said Sara Cody, director of the public-health department in Santa Clara County, the home of Silicon Valley, which has had two confirmed cases of Covid-19. Both patients had returned from Wuhan, China, where the epidemic began.
A coalition of staffers, employees from other departments, health-care providers and federal officials engaged in a classic outbreak response to monitor people who came in close contact with two local cases. And now, the department has added tracking recent arrivals from China to its to-do list.
Travel from mainland China to the U.S. has been curtailed since many airlines suspended flights and the U.S. barred entry to most foreign nationals arriving from China. Still, some Americans continue to arrive into 11 airports designated by federal officials, and health authorities are on the lookout for passengers who are coming from other countries but were also recently in China.
Those without symptoms who haven't been to Hubei province, which includes Wuhan, are allowed to go on to their final destinations, but are asked to stay at home for up to 14 days and contact their health-care providers if they develop symptoms. They are asked to avoid close contact with others, typically defined as being within 6 feet of another person for a prolonged period. The orders aren't binding, but local health officials can issue stricter quarantine orders if necessary. So far, most people are cooperative, local health officials say.
Seattle and King County in Washington state, which have roughly 400 people self-monitoring at home, have recruited volunteers from the University of Washington School of Public Health and the department's Public Health Reserve Corps, said Jeffrey Duchin, the health officer at Public Health-Seattle and King County. The county is spending roughly $200,000 a week on the response, which also requires redirecting staff from other tasks.
"The amount of manpower, both resources and time, has been tremendous, and so what that means is that our existing staff are working two jobs around the clock for several weeks," said Dr. Duchin. "It's been like one big, long bad day."
The effort is straining state and local budgets. States and some larger local departments receive support from the CDC's Public Health Emergency Preparedness funds, though the money is meant for preparing for an outbreak and doesn't often cover full responses, they say.
"I just look around, and there are a lot of people here because they're just committed to the mission, but they're getting tired," said Dr. Cody. "This is what they believe in, and that takes us a long way, but it won't take us for months and months and months."

China revoked the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters based in Beijing, the first time the Chinese government has expelled multiple journalists simultaneously from one international news organization since the country began re-engaging with the world in the post-Mao era.
China's Foreign Ministry said the move Wednesday was punishment for a recent opinion piece published by the Journal.
Deputy Bureau Chief Josh Chin and reporter Chao Deng, both U.S. nationals, as well as reporter Philip Wen, an Australian national, were ordered to leave the country within five days, said Jonathan Cheng, the Journal's China bureau chief.
The expulsions by China's Foreign Ministry followed widespread public anger at the headline on the opinion piece, which appeared online Feb. 3 and referred to China as "the real sick man of Asia." The ministry and state-media outlets had repeatedly called attention to the headline in statements and posts on social media and had threatened unspecified consequences.
"Regrettably, what the WSJ has done so far is nothing but parrying and dodging its responsibility," Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily news briefing Wednesday. "The Chinese people do not welcome those media that speak racially discriminatory language and maliciously slander and attack China."
The three journalists work for the Journal's news operation. The Journal has a strict separation between its news and opinion staffs.
William Lewis, the Journal's publisher and chief executive of its parent company, Dow Jones, said he was disappointed by the decision to expel the journalists and asked the Foreign Ministry to reconsider.
"This opinion piece was published independently from the WSJ newsroom and none of the journalists being expelled had any involvement with it," Mr. Lewis said.
"Our opinion pages regularly publish articles with opinions that people disagree -- or agree -- with and it was not our intention to cause offense with the headline on the piece," Mr. Lewis said. "However, this has clearly caused upset and concern amongst the Chinese people, which we regret."
Dow Jones is owned by News Corp.
In a note to news staff, Editor in Chief Matt Murray said the Journal would push to reverse the expulsions and continue its work covering China's rise as a global force.
"Let no one doubt that The Wall Street Journal remains fully committed to covering China, with the highest standards of news reporting," Mr. Murray wrote. "We will continue to write about China, without fear or favor and with no agenda but the truth."
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized China's action, saying: "The United States condemns China's expulsion of three Wall Street Journal foreign correspondents. Mature, responsible countries understand that a free press reports facts and expresses opinions. The correct response is to present counter arguments, not restrict speech. The United States hopes that the Chinese people will enjoy the same access to accurate information and freedom of speech that Americans enjoy."
China is battling a fast-spreading coronavirus, as well as questions from Chinese citizens and some global health experts about Beijing's handling of the epidemic, which has included the lockdown of much of Hubei province, with a population of nearly 60 million. Public anger at a perceived lack of transparency surrounding the coronavirus has exploded online, overwhelming the country's censorship apparatus.
The Committee to Protect Journalists called on China to restore the press credentials of the Journal reporters immediately. "China's expulsion of three accredited correspondents in reaction to what it sees as an offensive headline in the opinion section of The Wall Street Journal makes the country appear less like a confident rising power than a thin-skinned bully," said Steven Butler, CPJ's Asia program coordinator, in Washington, D.C.
"During a global health emergency, it is counterproductive for the Chinese authorities to be limiting the flow of news and information," Mr. Butler added.
In August, the Chinese government didn't renew press credentials for Chun Han Wong, a Beijing-based Journal correspondent who co-wrote a news article on a cousin of Chinese President Xi Jinping whose activities were being scrutinized by Australian law-enforcement and intelligence agencies.
Mr. Xi's private life and those of his relatives are considered sensitive by Chinese authorities. The Foreign Ministry had cautioned the Journal at the time against publishing the article, warning of unspecified consequences.
Mr. Wong was the first China-based Journal reporter to have his credentials denied since the newspaper opened a bureau in Beijing in 1980.
Beijing has taken a more combative stance with the foreign media in recent years, as Mr. Xi's government has exerted greater control over information and reasserted the Communist Party's influence over citizens' lives.
China has declined to renew the credentials of several reporters, but hasn't expelled a credentialed foreign correspondent since 1998 when, in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, it expelled Associated Press correspondent John Pomfret and Alan Pessin, Beijing bureau chief for Voice of America.
Censorship has been more strictly imposed on domestic news outlets and social media, and authorities have strengthened internet firewalls designed to keep Chinese people from reading foreign reporting that Beijing deems objectionable, including the Journal's website.
The expulsion of the Journal reporters Wednesday marks "an unprecedented form of retaliation against foreign journalists in China," the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said. It added that it is "an extreme and obvious attempt by the Chinese authorities to intimidate foreign news organizations by taking retribution against their China-based correspondents."
On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department said it had decided to identify the U.S. operations of state-run Chinese news outlets as foreign missions akin to embassies or consulates, the latest in a series of moves designed to pressure China's Communist Party into loosening controls on foreign diplomats and media.
Employees of those news organizations will now be required to register with the State Department as consular staff, though their reporting activities won't be curtailed, U.S. officials said.
Mr. Geng, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, called that change "totally unjustified and unacceptable" and warned of unspecified repercussions.
The phrase "sick man of Asia" was used by both outsiders and Chinese intellectuals to refer to a weakened China exploited by European powers and Japan in the late 1800s and early 1900s. This period is now described in Chinese history textbooks as the "century of humiliation."
The Journal's use of the phrase in the headline on an opinion column by Hudson Institute scholar Walter Russell Mead that referred to the coronavirus epidemic in China, sparked waves of angry commentary on social media in China and elsewhere.
Mr. Chin, the Journal's 43-year-old deputy bureau chief, has worked for the newspaper since 2008 and in recent years covered cybersecurity, law and human rights. A team he led won a 2018 Gerald Loeb Award for its coverage of the Communist Party's pioneering embrace of digital surveillance.
Ms. Deng, 32, joined the Journal in 2012 and has reported from Shanghai, Hong Kong and Beijing. Her recent areas of focus included China's economy and finance, and the trade war between the U.S. and China. Most recently, Ms. Deng has been on assignment in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the coronavirus epidemic originated late last year.
Mr. Wen, 35, started at the Journal in 2019 and has been reporting on Chinese politics. He co-wrote the article with Mr. Wong on the cousin of Mr. Xi whose activities were being scrutinized by Australian law-enforcement and intelligence agencies.
All three have reported on China's mass surveillance and detention of Uighur Muslims in the country's far western Xinjiang region.

Stocks Gain as China Backs Businesses

U.S. stocks rose after China launched fresh measures to support local businesses that are struggling because of the coronavirus epidemic.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 115.84 points, or 0.4%, to 29348.03, rising after three consecutive days of declines. The S&P 500 rose 15.86 points, or 0.5%, to a record of 3386.15. The Nasdaq Composite jumped 84.44 points, or 0.9%, to 9817.18, also setting a new high.
The recovery in equities came after China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said the government would connect factories with technology companies to identify weak links in their supply chains.
The assistance is one of several steps that Beijing and local Chinese authorities have taken to limit the economic fallout of the coronavirus.
"The market doesn't have much of a problem with anything at the moment," said Paul Ashworth, the chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. Investors are confident the economic impact of the coronavirus will be limited by government and central-bank efforts, he said.
In the afternoon, the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its January policy meeting. The minutes showed Fed officials expressed optimism about the U.S. economy, though the meeting occurred before the coronavirus epidemic accelerated.
With official Chinese manufacturing data not due to be published until Feb. 29, investors are relying on other measures to assess the economic impact of the illness.
Some of these gauges point to a steep decline in activity. Major energy producers have consumed a third less coal each day in February than normal seasonal patterns would suggest, Goldman Sachs Group economists said in a note.
But in the U.S., the argument for investing in stocks is still straightforward, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of research firm DataTrek Research. While corporate-earnings growth is down, profit margins and cash flows are still high.
That, he said, should lead to better earnings in the second half of the year. On top of that, interest rates are low and should remain low, he noted, which on its own makes equities attractive.
"That's why equities haven't sold off," Mr. Colas said.
One stock that dropped on Wednesday was Groupon. Shares of the high-tech coupon clipper plunged $1.35, or 44%, to $1.70 after the company reported weak fourth-quarter earnings, said it planned to shut down the part of its business that sells merchandise, and detailed plans for a reverse stock split.
Shares of Garmin rose $6.55, or 6.7%, to $103.67 after the maker of sports devices reported a key measure of fourth-quarter profit beat analysts' expectations, with the stock hitting a 10-year high.
Bed Bath &Beyond advanced 83 cents, or 7.1%, to $12.61 after new Chief Executive Mark Tritton laid out a plan for remaking the home-goods retailer.
Global stocks rose as well. In Europe, shares in clothing and consumer-goods companies were among the best performers as the Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.8%.
Japan's Nikkei Stock Average gained 0.9% amid a broad advance in Asia.
Gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,607.50, their highest closing level since March 2013. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 1.569% from 1.555%, snapping a three-day streak of declines.
In the foreign-exchange market, confidence that Beijing can contain the economic fallout from the epidemic spilled over into currencies. The Japanese yen, which is seen as a haven, fell 1.3% against the dollar.
U.S. oil prices rose 2.4% to $53.29 a barrel after the Trump administration blacklisted a trading brokerage owned by Russian oil giant Rosneft, which the U.S. said has helped Venezuela export crude.
The sanctions could reduce Venezuelan oil exports by as much as half a million barrels a day, reducing global supplies, according to Helge Andre Martinsen, an energy analyst at Norway's DNB Bank.

Critics say officials have moved slowly in dealing with fast spread
TOKYO " A Japanese infectious disease specialist who visited the quarantined Diamond Princess decried 'chaotic' and 'scary' conditions on the cruise liner that gave the coronavirus more opportunity to spread.
Kentaro Iwata, a professor from Kobe University, said he was left troubled by the lack of virus-control protocols, such as designated 'red zones' on the ship, which has been on lockdown at a dock in Yokohama for more than two weeks.
'It was completely chaotic,' Iwata said in a YouTube video posted late Tuesday, after he spent several hours on the ship as part of an assessment team.
'I was so scared of getting covid-19 because there was no way to tell where the virus is, no green zone, no red zone " everywhere could have the virus,' he said in English, describing the normal practice of cordoning off separate contaminated and virus-free areas. Another video, in Japanese, was viewed more than 1.3-million times.
For Japan's government, it was another stinging critique of its handling of the outbreak, including what critics call sluggish responses in imposing border controls earlier this month and ramping up virus testing.
In the past few days, the number of covid-19 cases " even outside the quarantined Diamond Princess " has more than doubled to 79, with many of the new cases not traceable to China.
That has forced health officials to acknowledge that 'local transmission' has begun and it's now 'impossible' to prevent the virus from spreading.
The virus has put politicians on the defensive all over the world as they struggle to react to a fast-evolving threat " with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his government the latest to feel the heat.
Here, the criticism echoes that leveled at the country during the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster " a reluctance to admit the scale of the problem, a lack of firm political leadership and a famously cautious bureaucracy.
'So scared'
On the Diamond Princess, meanwhile, at least 542 people have been found to have the virus, out of 2,404 people tested, with results still awaited on the final 1,300 tests.
Four people working on or around the ship during the quarantine period have also contracted the virus: a quarantine officer, a Health Ministry official, an ambulance driver and a medical staffer.
A Japanese man and woman " both in their 80s, who were passengers on the ship " died Thursday, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, marking the first time one of the cruise ship passengers has died.
The Japanese government insists the quarantine was a success and began letting its citizens who have tested negative off the ship Wednesday. They were allowed to take public transport home.
But the fact that the U.S. government evacuated its citizens before the quarantine period ended " and will subject them to an additional 14-day confinement in the United States " was an acknowledgment that it has a very different view.
'My deep worry has been that we are essentially condemning [people on board] to infection because of the close quarters in which they're staying,' said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore. 'And to what end are we doing this? Is it because we're trying to keep the virus out of the country? Japan already has local transmission.'
Iwata, the health expert, called the ship's infection-control measures 'completely inadequate.'
'Bureaucrats were in charge of everything' without a single professional infection control specialist on board, he said.
'I never had fear of getting infection myself, for Ebola, SARS, cholera, because I know how to protect myself, how to protect others and how infection control should be,' he said, describing his past work in Africa and with teams dealing with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the early 2000s.
'But inside the Diamond Princess,' he said, 'I was so scared.'
He has since returned to his home in Kobe but has isolated himself in a room for fear of infecting his family.
Responding to Iwata's complaints, Japanese chief government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said the government had been 'implementing measures to prevent the spread of the infection thoroughly.'
Falling support
Two opinion polls published Monday show support for Abe's government falling by five-percentage points and significant levels of dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the outbreak.
The cost to Japan's already struggling economy could be catastrophic, while the possible implications for the Summer Olympics in Tokyo are almost unthinkable.
The new coronavirus has moved fast, but the government's response has been slow and misguided, many experts say.
On Jan. 23, Japan began using monitors to check temperatures of passengers flying in from China, but it didn't starting denying entry to people from Hubei province until Feb. 1, a day after the U.S. administration barred all foreign travelers from China.
By then, thousands of tourists from Hubei had entered the country, some bringing the virus with them.
Critics said Abe appeared keener to avoid offending China ahead of a visit by President Xi Jinping planned for April than tackling the problem head on.
'The government seems to have been inordinately complacent when it should have been implementing sensible countermeasures and preparing for an outbreak,' said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan.
Masahiro Kami, executive director at Medical Governance Research Institute in Tokyo, said it was apparent the virus was spreading in Japan as early as Feb. 4, after a Thai couple returned home with the disease after a vacation in Japan.
Instead of relying on border controls, Kami argues the health ministry should have moved much more aggressively to work with private sector companies to expand virus testing capacity instead of relying on the ministry's own overburdened National Institute of Infectious Diseases.
'It's all about risk management at the expense of the larger crisis itself,' said Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo.
The politics of China
In response, Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said Japan has consistently taken action in line with the changing situation in China and intends 'to continue to tackle the situation with all our might.'
A new 'aggressive' strategy announced by Japan's Health Ministry this week recognized that a change of approach was required.
Test kits supplied by private-sector companies are finally going to be used to expand testing to more than 3,000 assessments a day, while beds in specialist hospitals will be reserved for more severe cases, rather than trying to isolate people with mild symptoms.
A public education campaign has begun and citizens are being discouraged from attending nonessential mass gatherings. Attention must also shift on how to protect Japanese over 65 years old, who make up a quarter of the population, experts say.
Instead of restricting tests to people who can show some link to China or another infected person, tests are now being made available to anyone with symptoms of the disease " one of the reasons for the recent jump in cases.
'With many emerging infections, when they're first recognized, there are so many unknowns,' said Jeffrey Duchin, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the University of Washington. 'You're almost always in a no-win situation. But you have to really adjust your tactics and your strategies as you go.'

Move comes after outcry in Beijing over a headline on an opinion piece
BEIJING " China ordered the expulsion of three Wall Street Journal correspondents Wednesday in retaliation for a column headline that Beijing deemed racist, a dramatic escalation in the Communist Party's efforts to silence criticism abroad as well as at home.
While the Foreign Ministry linked the expulsions to a Feb. 3 opinion piece by Walter Russell Mead that referred to China as the 'sick man of Asia,' the move followed a decision by the United States a day earlier to designate five major Chinese media outlets as government entities. 
American officials had warned correspondents in China working for U.S. media outlets that they could be affected by the designation.
China's Foreign Ministry 'reserves the right' to take further actions both against the Wall Street Journal and in response to the United States' designation, spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in announcing the expulsions.
The announcement represented a clear signal from China, whose government has tightened censorship and repression in recent years. In previous cases in which Beijing has evicted foreign journalists, it has usually allowed their existing press credentials to expire and then declined to renew them, a practice tantamount to expulsion but without the provocation.
The authorities also appeared to be attempting to stoke nationalist outrage in China at a time of extreme duress for the ruling Communist Party. The party has faced widespread criticism over its response to the novel coronavirus outbreak, which began in the city of Wuhan in December but did not elicit formal acknowledgment or emergency-response measures from the ruling party until the third week of January.
The Journal said the three correspondents affected by Wednesday's action were deputy bureau chief Josh Chin and reporter Chao Deng, both U.S. citizens, and reporter Philip Wen, an Australian national. They have been ordered to leave China within five days, it said. 
A statement from William Lewis, the chief executive of Dow Jones and publisher of the Journal, said that 'we are deeply disappointed' by China's decision, and he urged the Foreign Ministry to reinstate the visas for the three journalists.
'This opinion piece was published independently from the WSJ newsroom and none of the journalists being expelled had any involvement with it,' the statement said. 'In line with best practice, we enforce a complete separation between our News and Opinion departments.'
A similar policy of separate news and opinion departments is enshrined at most U.S. newspapers, including The Washington Post.
Lewis's statement added: 'Our opinion pages regularly publish articles with opinions that people disagree " or agree with " and it was not our intention to cause offense with the headline on the piece. However, this has clearly caused upset and concern amongst the Chinese people, which we regret.' 
Among the reporters ordered to leave, Deng at the time of the announcement was in Wuhan, the locked-down city in Hubei province at the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic. She has been filing reports on how ordinary people are coping and how Communist Party officials are trying to contain the virus. 
Wen was one of two authors of a report published last year that detailed allegations that a cousin of Chinese leader Xi Jinping was involved in high-stakes gambling and potential money laundering in Australia. The other reporter on that story, Chun Han Wong, a Singaporean national who had covered Chinese politics out of the paper's Beijing bureau since 2014, was effectively expelled when his press credentials expired and were not renewed in August. 
The title of the column at issue is a reference to a period around the middle of the 19th century until the early 20th century when a weak China, crippled by infighting, was carved up by colonial powers including Japan, Germany, France and Britain. China calls this period the 'century of humiliation' and vowed during the trade war with the United States that it will not be humiliated again.
The phrase echoed the moniker given at the time to the Ottoman Empire, which was called 'the sick man of Europe.' More recently, the label has been applied to Britain, first during the economic malaise of the 1970s and more recently as the country was wrangling with its exit from the European Union.
But in Beijing, the Foreign Ministry latched onto the Journal's headline with unbridled fury, repeatedly accusing the paper of using racially discriminatory language and offending the Chinese people. The Journal website is blocked by China's Great Firewall, meaning that readers within the country cannot access its website without software to make it appear that they are outside China.
'China demands the WSJ recognize the severity of its mistake, make an official apology and hold the persons involved accountable,' Geng told reporters Wednesday in a briefing conducted over the WeChat messaging app because public gatherings are banned during the coronavirus outbreak.
The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China condemned the decision, describing it in a statement as 'an extreme and obvious attempt by the Chinese authorities to intimidate foreign news organizations.'
The club, whose members include two Post correspondents, called the simultaneous expulsions 'an unprecedented form of retaliation against foreign journalists in China.'
This was the first outright expulsion of a foreign correspondent since 1998, according to the FCCC's tally. Since 2013, the year after Xi became China's leader, at least nine journalists have been effectively expelled by not having their press credentials renewed, meaning they had to leave the country.
Some analysts speculated that the decision was retaliation for the State Department's decision Tuesday to designate five of China's foremost media outlets as official government entities under the Foreign Missions Act, meaning they will be treated as though they are diplomatic outposts of the Chinese government and subject to the same constraints.

Why One of the World's Largest Tobacco Companies Is Struggling; Pyxus International, with almost $1 billion in near-term debt, is facing a cash crunch. Efforts to move into vaping and cannabis have hit roadblocks.

Pyxus International Inc., one of the world's largest suppliers of tobacco, is facing mounting financial pressure from a decline in its core business and setbacks in its efforts to diversify into cannabis and vaping fluids.
The North Carolina-based company, which changed its name from Alliance One International in 2018, is bracing for a cash crunch as losses mount and roughly $1 billion in debt maturities loom. The company's financial problems highlight declining global tobacco consumption coupled with regulatory uncertainty and heightened competition in the emerging recreational marijuana and vaping sectors.
Pyxus's big problem is that its core business—buying tobacco directly from farmers and then reselling it to major cigarette makers such as Philip Morris—is in decline. Global tobacco use has fallen over the past two decades, according to the World Health Organization. Altria Group Inc., which owns Philip Morris USA Inc., said last month that global cigarette industry volumes have contracted by 4% to 5.5% annually for the last several years. U.S. volumes are forecast to decline by 4% to 6% in 2020.
The numbers are stark. For its most recent quarter Pyxus's revenue declined 31% to $363 million and the company lost $22 million. Pyxus has roughly $900 million of bonds maturing in the next year and its $635 million in second-lien bonds are trading at 48 cents on the dollar, according to MarketAxess. The deeply distressed price levels for its debt indicate concerns the company won't be able to refinance. The company has $396 million of available credit lines and cash on its balance sheet, down by 25% from $528 million a year ago.
Pieter Sikkel, Pyxus's chief executive, believes the tobacco company is making headway in its bid to become a diversified agricultural technology and consumer goods company.
"We're excited by the progress we've made across categories and by the growth potential on the horizon," he said. "We have benefited from the progress of our diversification strategy, innovation efforts, and global presence."
Pyxus, which traces its roots to a tobacco trading business founded in Virginia in 1873, has attempted to diversify by acquiring stakes in companies that deal in legal cannabis, CBD, industrial hemp and e-liquids for vaping. However, the diversification bid hasn't yet paid off.
"They're not successful at their core tobacco business so they try to pivot into the cannabis space," said Alan Brochstein, founder of 420Investor.com, an online community for investors interested in publicly traded cannabis stocks. "Pyxus seems to be going at it from a position of weakness."
The Pyxus segment that contains its cannabis and e-liquids businesses saw its revenue decline by 24.5% year-over-year for the most recent quarter. The company pointed to a slower-than-expected rollout of legal cannabis retail availability in Canada, as well as a decrease in vaping e-liquids sales due to an industry downturn driven by health and regulatory concerns after a series of vaping-related deaths .
The combination of setbacks in the cannabis sector, delayed shipments due to a drought in Africa, and the impact of the trade wars has created a "perfect storm" for the company as its debt maturities approach next year, said Mary Ross Gilbert, a managing director at investment bank Imperial Capital LLC.
"And now we have the coronavirus. That's the cherry on top of this perfect storm," Mrs. Gilbert said.
Mr. Sikkel blamed the declining financial performance on poor shipment timing, delayed processing in Africa, and the impact of trade disputes and foreign tariffs.
U.S. tobacco sales to China have fallen sharply during the two-year trade war, leaving many farmers hoping the recently signed Phase 1 deal with Beijing will provide relief.
"While we are pleased that tobacco is included on the list of agricultural products in Phase 1 of the U.S.-China trade agreement, additional steps are needed to restart leaf exports from the United States to China," Mr. Sikkel said, adding that the company is closely monitoring the coronavirus.
As for the company's mixed results on cannabis and vaping e-liquids, Mr. Sikkel likened the company's diversification efforts to growing pains associated with a startup business.
"Our newer initiatives are in the process of being scaled to their full potential—we think of them as being in 'startup mode'—and are evolving quickly across these nascent industries," he told The Wall Street Journal.
In a nod to the looming debt maturities, Mr. Sikkel recently said Pyxus is evaluating a "potential partial monetization of interests" in its cannabis and e-liquids segment. He declined to elaborate.
However, Pyxus's prospects for obtaining an attractive price for its assets could be hindered by the recent collapse in cannabis company valuations , analysts said. Publicly listed cannabis companies such as Canopy Growth Corp., Tilray Inc., and Cronos Group Inc. have all seen their stock prices decline over the past six months, because of oversupply and weaker-than-expected demand.

Canada CPI Rose 2.4% in January as Gasoline Surged; Underlying data point to softness ahead in inflation

OTTAWA—Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated in January, driven by higher gasoline prices, although there are signs upward price pressure might be waning.
Canada's consumer-price index climbed 2.4% on a year-over-year basis in January, Statistics Canada said Wednesday. Market expectations called for a 2.3% rise, according to economists at TD Securities.
On a month-over-month basis, CPI climbed 0.3%.
The Bank of Canada's preferred measures for underlying inflation edged lower from the previous month, with the average core CPI for January at 2.03%, versus a revised 2.07% in the previous month. These core readings are designed to filter out volatile, month-to-month swings in prices. January marked the second straight month that the average core reading decelerated.
The Bank of Canada's task is to set interest rates at a level that achieves and maintains 2% inflation. In January, the central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1.75%, where it has been for over a year, but marked down its estimates for near-term growth. Bank of Canada Gov. Stephen Poloz also opened the door for a future rate cut if the domestic outlook deteriorates.
On-target inflation was an important reason the Bank of Canada remained on the sidelines in 2019 while many other developed-world central banks cut rates amid slowing global growth.
Economists said other underlying data in January, along with the core-inflation readings, point to softness in prices.
January's headline inflation rate of 2.4% was fueled by an 11.2% year-over-year jump in gasoline prices. The data agency said oil prices were low in January of last year because of a global supply glut. Statistics Canada added gasoline prices rose early in January because of geopolitical concerns in the Middle East. Later in January, oil prices retreated because of economic uncertainty caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
Excluding gasoline, Canada's annual inflation rate rose 2% in January. When food and energy are excluded, CPI rose 1.9%, or below the Bank of Canada's target.
"The positive contribution to inflation from higher oil prices will certainly unwind in February, bringing the headline rate down with it," said James Marple, an economist at TD Bank. He added the average price for a barrel of U.S. crude is down 12% so far in February from the average price for all of January.
Mr. Marple said the downside risks to the Canadian economy have intensified in recent weeks, citing the outbreak of the coronavirus hitting global growth and commodity prices, and rail blockades in eastern Canada that have upended the country's logistical network.

HSBC to Cut Staff By 15%, Focus On Asia --- Shift away from the U.S., Europe comes as bank plans to shed $100 billion in assets

LONDON -- HSBC Holdings PLC said it would shed 35,000 jobs and cut business lines and customer relationships across the U.S. and Europe, the latest phase in a decade-long retreat from global ambitions to focus on its Asian heartland.
The planned overhaul of the U.K.-based bank, one of the world's largest by assets, marks a significant step in a reorganization that started in the wake of the global financial crisis. Founded in Hong Kong in 1865, HSBC operates in 64 countries and territories but makes half of its revenue in Asia.
HSBC said the scaling back will help free up $100 billion in risk-weighted assets to reinvest into the faster-growing Asia and Middle East regions. About 15% of its jobs as of the end of last year will be cut, the company said.
The move comes as European economic growth continues to be anemic, and political challenges destabilize HSBC's two main markets, the U.K. and Hong Kong. Banks in Europe have been hobbled by low and negative interest rates that have made lending particularly challenging.
"It is a really big warning signal from HSBC," said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank.
HSBC, one of the U.K.'s dominant retail banks, is dealing with uncertainty surrounding the country's departure from the European Union. Meanwhile in Hong Kong, antigovernment protests, trade tensions between the U.S. and China and the coronavirus are weighing on business.
HSBC shares fell 6% Tuesday in London trading as investors braced for hefty restructuring charges. The bank said it would suspend until 2022 buybacks of shares that had helped buoy the stock.
The restructuring is being led by Chief Executive Noel Quinn, who took the job in August on an interim basis. Mr. Quinn is vying for the permanent role of CEO, which the bank said would be decided this year.
The revamp adds to a sweeping restructuring that began in 2011 and saw the bank exit most of Latin America. In the decades before that, it had expanded across the world through acquisitions, many of them ultimately unprofitable. HSBC, which has its French retail business up for sale, didn't give details of additional planned disposals.
HSBC will exit businesses "where necessary," Mr. Quinn said.
On Tuesday, the bank said net profit fell 53% to $5.97 billion last year, hit by a goodwill impairment of $7.3 billion. It said it expects to incur around $7.2 billion of costs related to the restructuring in the next few years.
At the end of 2019, the bank employed 235,000 people.
Executives said London will remain a hub for the investment bank, but increasingly will play a supporting role to operations in Hong Kong and Singapore.
"We are going to move more of our investment banking and global markets resources into Asia -- more of our sector specialists, more of our product specialists. We are going to look to base in Hong Kong and the rest of Asia," Mr. Quinn said in an interview. "We will still have a presence in London but it's fair to say the mix is going to change over the next two to three years."
HSBC's retail and commercial bank serving U.K. customers remains "very important," Mr. Quinn said, adding that he expects it to become increasingly tied to the rest of the world as the country leaves the EU. In mainland Europe, the bank plans to reduce its risk-weighted assets by 35%.
In its long-struggling U.S. arm, Mr. Quinn said HSBC would cut assets in investment banking and markets by almost half, and shut around 70 of its 229 branches. The retail bank will target "internationally affluent" individuals across the country, Mr. Quinn said.
"It will require a larger reduction in our branch network on the East Coast," Mr. Quinn said. "We are going to be opening up more branches in the international markets that are relevant to HSBC, principally on the West Coast of America."
As of September, HSBC was the U.S.'s 14th-largest commercial bank, according to Federal Reserve data, with around $181 billion in assets.
Mr. Quinn said he had considered putting the U.S. retail unit up for sale but decided against it because the country is a crucial part of the bank's global network and the customer deposits help support the business there.
Turbulence at HSBC is sapping morale within the bank, with 58% of employees saying they saw "the positive impact of our strategy" in 2019, down from 67% in 2018, according to a poll conducted by the lender.
In mainland China, HSBC has for years positioned itself to take advantage of growing economic ties between the most populous nation and the wider world. That integration is now challenged by the trade conflict with the U.S.
Chairman Mark Tucker said HSBC has reduced its expectations for Asian economic growth in 2020 as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. The bank said loan losses could rise and revenue could fall if the outbreak is prolonged.
"The agreement of a phase-one trade deal between China and the U.S. is a positive step, but we remain cautious about the prospects for a wider-ranging agreement given disagreements that still exist, particularly over technology," Mr. Tucker said.
Mr. Quinn, formerly the global commercial-banking head at HSBC, was elevated after Mr. Tucker decided new leadership was needed.
Mr. Tucker brushed aside questions Tuesday about whether it made sense for Mr. Quinn to make public a restructuring when he may not see the changes through. He said the restructuring and the selection of the new CEO were separate processes running in parallel.
The benefits of the restructuring will be evident largely from 2023 onward, said Citigroup analyst Ronit Ghose, who recommended that investors sell HSBC shares.

Many Stocks With China Exposure Miss Out on Market Rally

U.S. stocks have hit repeated highs this year, but many China-related trades still lag behind the broader market.
Hopes that the coronavirus outbreak will be contained -- and faith that central banks in China and the U.S. will step in, if needed, to support the economy -- have helped rejuvenate the stock market. The S&P 500 set its 12th record close of the year Friday. It is up 4.3% through Tuesday.
But shares of Chinese companies listed in the U.S. and many American companies with heavy sales exposure to China haven't gotten the same bump. Apple Inc. also warned on Monday that it won't meet its revenue projections for the current quarter, saying the coronavirus outbreak had limited iPhone production and curtailed demand for its products in China. The region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, accounts for almost one-fifth of Apple's total revenue. Apple shares fell 1.8% on Tuesday.
Nearly two-thirds of the U.S.-listed Chinese companies with market values of at least $1 billion are down for the year, according to data provider FactSet. For instance, coffee company Luckin Coffee Inc., known as the Chinese challenger to Starbucks Corp., and electric-car maker NIO Inc., considered the Chinese version of Tesla Inc., wiped out earlier gains of nearly 30% as the coronavirus emergency intensified.
China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has risen 8.7% since bottoming out on Feb. 3, recovering its post-Lunar New Year losses. It is still down 2.1% for the year through Tuesday.
Similarly, a basket of U.S. stocks with heavy revenue exposure to China also has struggled, falling by about 5.4% this year, according to an index compiled by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Among the 68 companies in that basket are manufacturer 3M Co., casino company Las Vegas Sands Corp. and restaurant operator Yum China Holdings Inc.
"I think it's a rational pullback," said Michael Farr, president of portfolio-management firm Farr, Miller &Washington, which has $1.9 billion in assets under management. "You're seeing how commerce is becoming stalled in China and how people are cocooning because of this epidemic."
He said he is considering buying shares of Yum China, which runs more than 9,000 KFCs, Pizza Huts and other outlets as China's largest restaurant company. The company said earlier this month that it was forced to close more than 30% of its locations because of the coronavirus. The stock is down 6.7% for the year.
Similarly, Starbucks said last month that it temporarily closed more than half its stores in China. Mr. Farr, a Starbucks shareholder, said he expects the stock could take an additional hit. Shares are up 1.5% in 2020.
"These stocks should go down, but they are going to be buying opportunities at some point," he said.
Wall Street economists expect the virus to hurt the Chinese economy in the first quarter and weigh on the rest of the world, including the U.S.
JPMorgan Chase &Co. economists recently cut their estimate for first-quarter global growth in half to a 1.3% annualized rate but predict a strong rebound later in the year.
U.S. hotel and casino operators with properties in China also have been hit hard. Wynn Resorts Ltd. said last week that the closure of its casino in the semiautonomous city of Macau would cost it $2.6 million a day, largely to pay employee salaries.
Macau has been a cash cow for the Las Vegas giants and other casino players for almost two decades, generating more than five times the revenue of Las Vegas in 2018. Wynn shares have dropped 12% since mid-January.
The declines also have prompted increased activity from short sellers looking to profit from continued drops. Short sellers borrow shares and sell them with the hope of profiting by buying the shares back at a lower price later and pocketing the difference.
Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm, said he has seen a significant increase in activity from investors betting against many of the U.S.-listed Chinese travel and consumption companies.
Among this group, Mr. Dusaniwsky said he has seen the largest increase of shares shorted in Chinese travel agent Trip.com Group Ltd. Its stock has fallen 14% since mid-January.
Similarly, short interest has surged in Luckin, the Chinese coffee company, which has also been the target of an anonymous report questioning its business model, management and financial results.
On Feb. 3, Luckin said the report, which was circulated online by short seller Muddy Waters, was malicious and all of its claims were either false, misleading or irrelevant.
Mr. Dusaniwsky said one reason Trip, Luckin and other U.S.-listed Chinese companies have become popular targets for short sellers is the difficulty in shorting shares in China itself. That leaves these companies as "the main vehicle to accumulate short exposure to the Chinese market," he said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped after Apple Inc. warned its revenue may be lower than forecast due to the coronavirus in China, one of the most significant indications yet of the epidemic's impact on multinational businesses.
The blue-chip index fell 165.89 points, or 0.6%, to 29232.19. The S&P 500 lost 9.87 points, or 0.3%, to 3370.29.
After spending most of Tuesday in negative territory, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite turned positive in the afternoon, gaining 1.57 points, less than 0.1%, to 9732.74, a record close.
Shares of Apple declined $5.95, or 1.8%, to $319 after the technology giant said revenue this quarter won't reach its targeted range of $63 billion to $67 billion as the virus has limited iPhone production and curtailed demand in China.
"This is a reality check that it's really happening," said Kit Juckes, a macro strategist at Societe Generale. "While it's not a big surprise that the global economy has been affected all the way to California tech, some people take this as a confirmation."
Weeks after concerns over the coronavirus began to jolt markets, the extent to which the global economy will suffer remains unclear. The epidemic forced companies to shut down their Chinese operations temporarily, while travel bans and restrictions on movement in public spaces led to a slowdown in consumer spending and industrial production in the world's second-largest economy.
Although the S&P 500 and the Dow lost ground Tuesday, major indexes remain close to all-time highs. The S&P 500 has hit a dozen record closes in 2020, after climbing 29% in 2019.
Investors eager for fresh clues about the state of the economy parsed data Tuesday showing that a measure of U.S. home-builder confidence edged down in February but remains near a two-decade high. On Friday, a survey from the University of Michigan showed Americans' economic outlook rose strongly in early February.
"Recent data has been leaning toward the stronger side, particularly around the labor market," said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management. "Consumer sentiment appears to be elevated still, and equities have kind of hung in there over this time frame. We think overall the U.S. is still in pretty good shape."
Among individual stocks Tuesday, Franklin Resources Inc. gained $1.69, or 6.9%, to $26.05 after it agreed to buy Legg Mason Inc. and form a $1.5 trillion-asset manager. Kroger Co. rose $1.48, or 5.2%, or $29.71 after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said it had bought a stake in the company.
Packaged-food company Conagra Brands Inc. slid $2.01, or 6.1%, to $30.68 after it cut its outlook for the year.
Elsewhere, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 declined 0.4%, while most major markets in Asia closed down, with the Hang Seng Index falling 1.5%.

World News: Ship Quarantine Faulted as Infections Rise --- U.S. physician aboard cruise vessel said crew lacked training to isolate passengers

TOKYO -- After decades as a primary-care doctor in Elizabethton, Tenn., Arnold Hopland thought he knew something about preventing infections. And the way they were doing a virus quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise ship didn't look right.
Dr. Hopland, a passenger, counted as many as 10 interactions a day with staff coming to deliver meals, toiletries and chocolate to keep up spirits. Passengers were drying laundry on their balconies without wearing face masks. Some leaned over to talk to their next-door neighbors.
As the two-week quarantine came to an end Wednesday, the result of such holes was becoming clear. On Tuesday, the number of passengers and crew who caught the novel coronavirus passed 500, Japan's government said, offering new evidence that the quarantine failed to stop more people from getting infected.
Just before he was supposed to get on a U.S.-chartered plane back home with his wife, Regina, Dr. Hopland got a knock on his cabin door and learned the hard way what could happen when his warnings weren't heeded: Mrs. Hopland tested positive for the novel coronavirus. He also found out his room steward had taken ill.
Mrs. Hopland, 74, is in a Tokyo-area hospital now, while Dr. Hopland, 75, who was told he didn't have the virus, remains on board.
"I was surprised I was negative because I knew the virus had swept through this boat like wildfire," Dr. Hopland said. "My analogy is they put us in a petri dish to get infected."
After 328 Americans flew back to the U.S. on Monday on U.S. government-chartered cargo jets, the disembarkation of the remaining Diamond Princess passengers began Wednesday at its docking spot in Yokohama, south of Tokyo.
The number of infections so far -- 542 as of Tuesday -- represents about one in seven of the 3,700 originally aboard and makes the cruise ship the largest known outbreak site outside of China. Test results for more than 1,000 people remain to be released.
"My initial assumption was that quarantine cannot be maintained on a boat, and I believe it has been clearly held true," Dr. Hopland said.
In the middle of the quarantine, Dr. Hopland expressed his concern to a friend and fellow medical doctor, Rep. Phil Roe (R., Tenn.). In a call, Dr. Hopland says he told the lawmaker that the crew was working hard to keep passengers well-fed but didn't have the training to carry out a quarantine.
Rep. Roe said he spoke to U.S. health officials and they shared his concern that the situation on the ship was exposing passengers to high risk.
"That was key in getting them evacuated," he said.
Japanese officials defended their response as the best under the circumstances, saying it wasn't clear how else the public could be protected and there wasn't any obvious place to send the passengers.
They also said they strengthened antivirus measures over time. Initially stewards were handing out food prepared on ship hand-to-hand, but as of Tuesday, a company was preparing the meals outside the ship to prevent infections via food.
Keiichi Ishida, a health ministry official, said if the government had let people who had no symptoms or tested negative leave the ship in the initial days of the quarantine, the outcry would have been even greater because some could be harboring infections. "You're telling me it would have been OK to have everyone released back then? If so, we'd like to do that next time."
Mr. Ishida acknowledged the virus has spread somewhat on the ship, but said, "We succeeded in containing it to a certain degree."
Some 60 Americans who tested positive remain behind in Japan, mostly in hospitals. Rep. Roe said U.S. health officials were discussing how those people could be repatriated. Fourteen passengers on the two previous repatriation flights tested positive but had no symptoms and were allowed on the planes.
Japan expects to get most remaining passengers off the ship by Friday. Everyone is getting tested for the virus, and those who are negative won't have any restrictions on their movements, Japanese officials said.
Still, most countries are following the U.S. lead and requiring returning citizens to undergo two additional weeks of quarantine. Countries including Canada, Australia and Italy are sending planes for their citizens.

Palladium Hits Record Despite Auto Disruption

Palladium prices soared Tuesday despite shutdowns and delays at car plants in China, the world's biggest consumer of the precious metal, highlighting an extended spell of volatility in the commodity's market.
The price of the metal -- which is in high demand from auto makers seeking to meet tighter emissions standards -- jumped 7.8% in the New York futures market, with most-actively traded contracts hitting a record of $2,497.60 a troy ounce. The continued rise took traders and analysts by surprise as it extended the advance in 2020 to more than 30%. Prices have more than doubled since the end of 2018.
China's automotive market has been disrupted this year by the outbreak of the new coronavirus as factories were forced to halt operations to help curtail the contagion. Germany's Volkswagen AG has postponed resuming production at some of its Chinese plants until next week as the quarantine of nearly 60 million people constrains the transportation of both parts and workers.
Palladium's price, meanwhile, has rallied as its supply has been strained by years of stalled production by miners.
"It's the most dysfunctional market I've ever seen in my life," said Michael Widmer, an analyst at Bank of America. If palladium keeps growing more expensive, it will force car manufacturers to electrify their vehicle fleets faster than previously planned, he added.
Upheaval in China, the world's second-largest economy, following the coronavirus outbreak has weighed on the price of many raw materials, including oil and industrial metals. Oil prices were little changed Tuesday, with U.S. crude futures erasing an earlier slide to close unchanged at $52.05 a barrel. Brent crude inched up 0.1% to $57.75 a barrel. Most-active copper futures inched up 0.2% to $2.6040 a pound.
While analysts are worried about falling consumption of those commodities, demand for palladium has surged in recent years as officials in the European Union and China imposed stricter restrictions on emissions from cars. When applied to catalytic converters that are fitted to gasoline-driven cars, the metal is highly effective at converting toxic gases such as carbon monoxide into substances that are less toxic to inhale.
Almost all gasoline cars manufactured in China this year will meet updated emissions standards, up from two-thirds in 2019, according to a recent report by the U.K.'s Johnson Matthey. The British chemicals maker said this will raise the average amount of palladium that car makers use in each catalyst, and could push the global demand for the metal in the auto industry above 10 million ounces.
Supply hasn't kept up pace with consumption because palladium is typically produced as a byproduct of platinum, and miners are wary of flooding the weaker platinum market with excess material.
Prices have spiked as a result. The rally is hurting auto makers already grappling with a downturn in the global car market and the cost of designing and producing new fleets of electric vehicles.
Elsewhere in commodities Tuesday, most-active gold futures rose 1.1% to $1,603.60 a troy ounce. Natural-gas prices surged 7.8% to $1.981 a million British thermal units on forecasts for cold temperatures across much of the country.

Euro Extends Its Fall On Germany Outlook

The euro ticked lower against the dollar to trade at near its lowest level in almost three years after a measure of economic expectations in Germany dropped.
The measure, which assesses sentiment about Germany's economic outlook, declined to 8.7 points in February from 26.7 in January, the ZEW economic research institute said on Tuesday.
Achim Wambach, the institute's president, cited fears over the coronavirus's effects on global trade as a key driver of the decline.
The euro dropped 0.4% against the dollar from Monday afternoon to trade at $1.0794 Tuesday, its lowest level against its U.S. counterpart since April 2017, according to FactSet.
The yield on the 10-year German bund climbed slightly to minus 0.408% from minus 0.436% on Monday afternoon, according to Tradeweb.
The data presents a picture at odds with the stock market, where the Stoxx Europe 600 is up 4.8% this month and the S&P 500 is up 4.5% over the same period, said Lauri Halikka, a foreign-exchange and fixed-income strategist at Sweden's SEB Bank.
While the move in the euro was "a knee-jerk reaction," he said, the common currency has fallen in recent weeks as investors worry that lower output from Chinese factories and weaker demand from consumers in the world's No. 2 economy could hurt European growth.
Investors will look to data due Feb. 24 from Germany's Ifo Institute for a better sense of business expectations and how the coronavirus will affect the European economy, said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist in Germany at ING Bank.
"Market participants will be looking for any guidance," Mr. Brzeski said.

The World Closes Its Doors To China: 'I Feel So Isolated' --- Travel bans thwart ambitions to be the center of commerce and culture

SHANGHAI -- To celebrate Christmas one year, Jing Sun trekked to the North Pole to see reindeer. For another holiday, the Shenzhen native flew to Marrakesh, and she was recently in Cleveland for work. Los Angeles, New York and Barcelona were on her spring itinerary, while her maiden Australia voyage was penciled in.
Suddenly, the 29-year-old is grounded in Beijing.
Fearing the contagious coronavirus, the world has severed many links to China. More than 30 airlines have suspended China service, while a 78-nation matrix of rules and quarantines from the U.S. to Singapore have all but banned Chinese travelers from foreign soil. As of Tuesday, the virus has sickened more than 73,000 and killed 1,853, according to the World Health Organization.
Watching the drawbridges go up is a jolt to China's masses of travelers, including families on holiday, students studying abroad, globe-trotting lawyers, financiers and art dealers, such as Ms. Sun. Their livelihoods are impacted, and egos bruised.
The checks on its people undermine core Chinese government ambitions to position the country at the center of global diplomacy, commerce and culture. They threaten its export deals, convention business and efforts to position its modern airports as global transit points.
The international community's defensive posture also stands in contrast to assurances from Beijing that the coronavirus is under control. The measures represent some of the few points of leverage many countries still have with China.
It is an abrupt snapback. All corners of the globe sought to capture the spending power of the 150 million international trips taken annually by Chinese. The U.S. and Japan offer 10-year visas, airlines advertise Mandarin speaking flight attendants and hotels equip rooms with teapots.
Ms. Sun, who handles international marketing for a leading Beijing gallery, Long March Space, had to cancel her mid-February attendance at Frieze Los Angeles, a major art fair. This week, despite 14 months of preparation, she won't be in New York to host museum directors and millionaire collectors she invited to Soho to see works by artist Guo Fengyi, whose intricate drawings command prices up to $60,000.
"For us it's devastating emotionally," said Ms. Sun, admitting she has felt "confusion, sadness and fear."
Off also is her Barcelona sojourn, and she now talks in the past tense about her plan to see Australia.
China's government sparked the travel tangle in late January by abruptly locking down 60 million people in Wuhan, the central city where the outbreak was first detected and remains concentrated, and the surrounding province, Hubei. City and neighborhood blockades constrained movement elsewhere. It created a national gridlock smack in the middle of the Lunar New Year holiday, the world's largest annual migration of people.
Soon, the U.S. and other countries advised their citizens to depart China, and dozens of airlines halted flights to the country, blaming cratered demand. China's diplomats have tried, and mostly failed, to compel other nations to heed WHO advisories and relax the restrictions. "To avoid causing panic and impeding normal personnel exchanges and practical cooperation in various fields," governments should not "overreact," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday.
Hong Kong private jet advisory Asian Sky Group said demand for charters in China is up as people try to avoid commercial carriers, even domestically, but for crews "there is significant reluctance to perform flights into China." FlightAware.com data show just a handful of business jets departing Beijing since the global lockdown.
The 2003 outbreak in China of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, disrupted travel, too, but planes kept flying. It was an era when over twice as many visited China as traveled abroad.
The international mobility of China's people skyrocketed along with its economy in the past two decades. Tourists flood Paris, Kyoto and New York. Power brokers for Chinese technology multinationals such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co. do deals globally, and VIPs hop private jets to January's World Economic Forum in Switzerland and France's Cannes Film Festival each May. Thousands of Chinese flock to Nebraska each spring for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. annual meeting.
It's a recent boom. Sealed borders characterized Mao Zedong's China, and in the roughly three decades of his rule, only 210,000 passports were issued. When ordinary citizens started getting passports in the 1990s, most were single-use, and it wasn't unusual for applicants to receive a visit from suspicious state security agents. As recently as the early 2000s, just seven Chinese out of 10,000 went abroad, and their primary "foreign" experience was a tour package to Hong Kong.
Today, over 180 million Chinese citizens have a passport. In comparison, some 146 million U.S. passports are in circulation.
Chinese tour groups serve about 160 nations. More than 660,000 Chinese study overseas, making education one of the biggest exports to China from the U.S. and Australia.
President Xi Jinping has made international connections a cornerstone policy called the Belt and Road Initiative. The president envisages infrastructure linking China with Europe along the ancient Silk Road and on sea routes first plied by a 15th-century mariner, Zheng He, who reached Africa and possibly California.
"The glory of the ancient silk routes shows that geographical distance is not insurmountable," Mr. Xi proclaimed in 2017.
Eager to attract the spending of Chinese visitors, over 70 countries from Thailand to Serbia welcome them visa-free. Chinese citizens are now second among recipients of U.S. nonimmigrant visas, after Mexicans, with 1.1 million last year, and many of those permit multiple entries over a 10-year period. Nearly 80% of international visas issued by Japan go into Chinese passports, and more than 160 flights weekly connect China and Australia. Beijing Capital Airport is the world's second busiest, after Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson.
For marketing executive Chen Hua, the welcome mat seemed to disappear during the two hours on Jan. 25 that she was airborne between Nanjing and Taiwan. Unbeknown to her group, the island's government had banned visitors from China, so her two-family party of nine was handed a "Letter of Repatriation" upon arrival that ordered them out.
Their planned six days in Taiwan turned into 25 hours on airport benches waiting for seats on a return flight. "I did not expect the epidemic to develop so quickly," Ms. Chen said.
On break from her masters program at the University of Sydney, She Yuxuan was visiting her grandmother in Wuhan last month when the city abruptly shut its borders. Her 23rd birthday passed without presents, and the lockdown prevented a short trip she planned to Japan and her return to Australia, where she has rented an apartment and owes school fees. "I feel so isolated because I've been staying home for a month," said Ms. She. "When is this going to end?"
Steaming out of Mexico for Hawaii, Japan and China aboard a Semester at Sea voyage in early January, Yan Yuehao was looking forward to a Lunar New Year docking in his hometown, Shanghai, where he planned to dazzle his shipmates with its bright holiday lanterns.
Yet bad news about the coronavirus caught up to the college junior even in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, including cancellation of the Shanghai stop. No one was sick among the 500 students on Mr. Yan's vessel, so it kept sailing.
When the Semester at Sea ship diverted to a Vietnamese port last week, local authorities barred only Mr. Yan and two other mainland Chinese passengers from disembarking. Mr. Yan said he isn't comfortable calling his treatment discrimination and said "there may be other factors." The ship is now sailing for Africa.
The art dealer, Ms. Sun, doesn't recall a time in her life when she didn't have a passport. She experienced foreign cultures as a girl in the 1990s when her family joined a tour popular with novice travelers dubbed "xin-ma-tai," referring to the Mandarin abbreviations for Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.
By the time she was a teenager, Ms. Sun was flying alone, including to St. Louis, near where she spent two years of high school, followed by university programs in Boston, New York and London. Ms. Sun worked in museums and galleries along the way.
In 2015, the U.S. State Department stamped a multiple-entry visa in her red passport good through August 2025. "It definitely gives me a sense of security; if I want to go to the U.S., I can go to the U.S.," she said.
Two years ago she and friends ventured to Finland and the North Pole to sit with Santa, pet his reindeer and ride snowmobiles. Later Ms. Sun flew to Morocco and called the landscapes, food and culture "just so exotic."
Now based in Beijing, Ms. Sun attends art events world-wide. She scours airline timetables for overnight flights that offer a chance to sleep ahead of whirlwind schmoozes with collectors and celebrities. "You're in heels and you have to look perfectly beautiful," she said, joking the pressure is an "exhilarating nightmare."
She connected with a British collector's representative at a Swiss fair in 2017, flew to London to follow up, and has since sold the client over $4 million in artwork, including a large sculpture designed for the middle of a lake. "Face-to-face consulting means a lot," Ms. Sun said.
While visiting her parents for the Lunar New Year in late January, Ms. Sun grew anxious the coronavirus might threaten her U.S. trip. "I just need my passport, I just need my passport," she repeated to herself over dinner while plotting an immediate departure for Los Angeles.
"Then the announcement came," she said, referring to new U.S. restrictions on visitors from China. She dispatched regrets to her artworld clients and contemplated what she can do online, but conceded "being there, and not being present makes a big difference."

HOUSINGU.S. home builders upbeat, report says
U.S. home builder sentiment in February remained near the highest level since 1999 as lower borrowing costs kept construction firms upbeat about sales prospects.
The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index in February edged down one point to 74, according to a report out Tuesday.
Readings above 50 indicate that more builders view conditions as good rather than as poor, and the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists called for the gauge to hold at 75.
The number underscores steady growth in residential construction that has contributed to economic growth the past two quarters. Mortgage rates are hovering near a three-year low, making home purchasing a bit more affordable even as asking prices remain elevated.
'Steady job growth, rising wages and low interest rates are fueling demand, but builders are still grappling with increasing construction and development costs,' NAHB Chairman Dean Mon said in a statement.
All three components of the housing market index " current purchases, expected sales and prospective buyer traffic " eased one point in February.

BANKINGHSBC to shed 35,000 jobs in overhaul
Europe's biggest bank, HSBC, will shed some 35,000 jobs as part of an overhaul to focus on faster-growing markets in Asia and as it tries to cope with multiple global uncertainties, including Brexit, trade wars and the new coronavirus.
HSBC's interim chief executive, Noel Quinn, said Tuesday that the number of people employed by the bank would fall from 235,000 to 200,000 in the next three years. Some of the reductions would come from attrition as opposed to outright cuts.
HSBC is based in London but does most of its business in Asia. The new coronavirus is compounding HSBC's challenges as it disrupts business in the company's main market.
The bank's net profit fell 53-percent to $6-billion in 2019 and, for this year, it warned of 'significant disruption'' to its operations caused by the viral outbreak in China.
HSBC's business in Europe is also under pressure. It must grapple with Britain's departure from the European Union and the uncertainty that will accompany negotiations on future trade relations.

RETAILUnseasonable warmth bolsters spending
Retail sales figures released Friday showed that consumers were inspired by unseasonably warm weather to spend on their homes in January but that overall sales growth was modest. The Commerce Department reported a 0.3-percent gain last month after a 0.2-percent gain in December. 
Although economists called the report disappointing, they noted that more consumers are working, a good omen for higher retail sales in the coming months. January employment reports from the Labor Department and the payroll processor ADP showed strong job growth at companies of all sizes.
The ADP report also showed small businesses joining larger companies in stepping up hiring. ADP's business customers with up to 49 staffers added 94,000 jobs in January vs. 66,000 positions in December. The two-month showing was a big gain over the nearly 31,600 new jobs ADP counted on average each month in 2019. In 2018, the monthly average was 52,000.

Franklin Resources and Legg Mason said Tuesday that they will combine to compete as low-cost index funds. California-based Franklin agreed to buy Chicago-based Legg Mason to create an asset-management firm with a combined $1.5-trillion of assets. Customers are focusing more than ever on costs for money management, and a few large index fund managers dominate the field in managed assets globally.
The European Union has added four countries and jurisdictions to its blacklist of tax havens, including the Cayman Islands, a British overseas territory. E.U. finance ministers also added Palau, Panama and the Seychelles to the list of jurisdictions that have not implemented tax policies to be in line with E.U. standards. The E.U. set up the system to sanction those it deems guilty of unfairly offering tax-avoidance schemes. 
Dell Technologies has sold one of its cybersecurity units, RSA, to a consortium led by Symphony Technology Group, Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board and AlpInvest Partners, part of the computer maker's efforts to streamline its business. The $2.08-billion all-cash transaction is expected to close in six to nine months, the companies said Tuesday in a statement.

Markets slide as Apple's revenue warning takes a toll

Coronavirus outbreak is disrupting supply chains, companies worldwide 
Global stocks fell Tuesday after Apple said the coronavirus would crimp its quarterly revenue, signaling that China's health crisis is casting an ever-widening shadow.
'The floodgates are opening,' said Invesco chief market strategist Kristina Hooper in an email following the market's close. 'Companies are beginning to warn that the coronavirus outbreak will impact earnings and stocks have begun to react negatively.'
China accounts for roughly 20-percent of global gross domestic product. It has been hit hardest as the epicenter of the outbreak, with more than 72,000 cases. The epidemic has forced the country into lockdown and idled its manufacturing industry, a vital supplier to companies everywhere.
The virus had killed more than 1,800 people worldwide as of Monday, and its fallout has rippled around the globe through supply chain disruptions, cratering tourism and travel, and widespread store closures that are challenging global firms and stalling growth at a time when it was expected to rebound thanks to the U.S.-China trade truce. Experts now predict the global economy will shrink this quarter for the first time since 2009.
'Markets have been far too complacent about how China's woes would have a direct impact on supply chains for a large number of companies around the world,' Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said in commentary Tuesday. 'If factories are closed, are running at partial capacity, or are struggling to get raw materials to make goods, then it is no wonder that supplies will be disrupted.'
The Dow Jones industrial average declined for the third day in a row after hitting record highs last week. The Dow closed at 29,232.19 on Tuesday, down 165.89 points, or 0.56 percent, after bouncing back from a 300-point fall earlier in the day. Walmart was the Dow leader, gaining 1.48 percent on the day after it announced a hefty dividend increase. Dow Inc., Goldman Sachs Group and Intel " along with Apple " were the big drags on the blue chips as 24 of its 30 components finished in the red.
The Standard - Poor's 500 stock index closed down about 10 points, or 0.29 percent, to finish at 3,370.29. Utilities, communication services and consumer discretionary sectors were the only positive industries among the 11 sectors in the S-P. Financials, energy and industrials were the big losers. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index closed the day just a hair inside the plus column after Apple cut its losses. Tech star Microsoft surged. Europe's benchmark Stoxx 600 index finished down 0.38 percent on the day. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed down more than 1.5 percent.
Some investors took heart from the late rally by the Nasdaq and Apple.
'Those betting on a major stock market decline may be making a losing bet,' said Peter J. Tanous of Lynx Investment Advisory. 'While the virus has infected many thousands of people, the death rate among those inflicted is just over 2 percent, which means that 98 percent of those who get it survive.'
The coronavirus has slammed China's economy, diminishing its oil consumption and disrupting the careful symmetry between global supply and demand. U.S. benchmark crude and Brent crude were trading at around $52 and $57 per barrel, respectively, far lower than what oil companies and major supplier nations prefer. BP has warned that the virus could reduce global oil demand by as much as 40 percent this year.
Gold, a safe haven, climbed more than 1 percent to $1,604 an ounce.
Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday cut its 2020 forecast for China growth from 5.8 percent to 5.2 percent to reflect the outbreak's 'severe but short-lived' impact that would probably spill into neighboring Asian economies.
'Our baseline assumption is that the economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak will continue for a number of weeks before tailing off and allowing normal economic activity to resume,' Christian de Guzman, a Moody's senior vice president, said in the report.
Apple, which counts on greater China for nearly a fifth of its revenue, warned investors Monday that it is experiencing an iPhone supply shortage as Chinese factories have been slow to come back to life. The tech giant, whose success over the past decade has been tethered to its ability to harness China's massive labor force and sprawling network of component manufacturers, also said demand for its products in China had been significantly hurt by store closures. The few stores that have remained open are operating on reduced hours 'with very low customer traffic.'
'This unexpected news confirms the worst fears of the Street that the virus outbreak has dramatically impacted iPhone supply from China/Foxconn with a demand ripple impact worldwide,' Dan Ives, managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities, wrote in a research note Monday. 'While we have discussed a negative iPhone impact from the coronavirus over the past few weeks, the magnitude of this impact to miss its revenue guidance midway through February is clearly worse than feared.'
Other major companies are warning that the virus could take a bite out of their earnings. Tesla cited 'health epidemics' as a risk last week, and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba called the outbreak a 'black swan' event. Nike, which has closed half its stores in China, said the outbreak will have a 'material impact' on its operations in the country. Disney has said it could take a $175-million hit in operating income if its theme parks in China are shuttered for the next two months, and manufacturing giants General Motors, Toyota and Airbus have all warned of slow returns to production.
China's massive aviation market " which is poised to eclipse the United States this decade and become the world's biggest " saw capacity shrink by nearly 80 percent between Jan. 20 and Feb. 17, according to OAG Aviation Worldwide. More than 40 airlines around the world have cut or halted service to China because of the outbreak.

Walmart misses targets as holidays disappoint

Walmart disappointed on multiple fronts Tuesday, falling short of its fourth-quarter targets and full-year outlook after shoppers scaled back on clothing, toys and video games during the holiday shopping season. But analysts say a key question remains: How will coronavirus affect the world's largest retailer?
The retail giant " which has hundreds of stores in China and gets about 15-percent of its products from factories there " says that while it is monitoring the outbreak, it has no immediate plans to lower its sales forecast because of it.
Though consumers continue to prop up much of the U.S. economy, there are mounting fears the public health crisis in China will have a cascading economic impact. A number of major companies, including Tesla, Nike and Disney, have warned that the virus could take a long-term toll on earnings, and Apple this week said it would miss its quarterly revenue goals because of slowing iPhone production in China. Global markets remained jittery Tuesday as investors looked for signs that other major brands may also take a hit.
'Potential supply chain pressures, in light of virus related challenges in China,' continue to present a wild card for the company, Michael Lasser, an analyst for UBS, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.
'Make no mistake: If anything is going to dent the world economy, it's coronavirus,' said Bob Phibbs, chief executive of the Retail Doctor, a New York-based consulting firm. 'It's going to hit all retailers, but the problems are especially magnified for Walmart.' 
With $524-billion in annual sales, Walmart is a closely watched bellwether for the rest of the industry. Its share price remained largely flat Tuesday.
So far, Walmart executives said Tuesday, sales in China have not been affected, even as the country is largely on lockdown. Residents have become increasingly reliant on the company for home delivery of groceries and other supplies. Walmart has 430 stores and 30 warehouses in the country. But industry experts said the outbreak could have far-reaching effects, extending to the company's supply chain.
'Like many other U.S. companies, Walmart has set up a robust supply chain over many years in China,' said George Calhoun, professor of quantitative finance for the Stevens Institute of Technology. 'There is no question that it will be impacted and disrupted.' 
Last week, the Bentonville, Ark., company said it would lay off nearly 300 workers in New York as it shutters its Jet Black personal shopping service. It also is whittling down mid-level management positions at 1,100 Neighborhood Market and Super center stores.
Walmart's tepid results come as retailers across the country struggle to get customers into their stores. Same-store sales " a closely watched measure at stores and websites open at least one year " grew 1.9-percent during the fourth quarter, vs. 4.2-percent growth a year earlier.
'Unlike past quarters Walmart was not firing on all cylinders during the last part of the year,' Neil Saunders, executive director of GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients. The company's clothing selections, he added, 'were uninspiring, difficult to shop, and did very little to stimulate the consumer.' 
Online sales, which grew 37-percent last year compared with the year before, remained a bright spot for the company, as did groceries. Walmart has invested heavily in its e-commerce business in recent years as it looks for new ways to win over customers. The company said Tuesday it expects that growth to slow this year, to about 30-percent.
Fourth-quarter revenue grew 2.1-percent to $141.7-billion, falling short of analysts' expectations, while profits rose 12-percent to $4.3-billion.
For the year, Walmart reported $524-billion in revenue " nearly double Amazon's $280.5-billion.

Why One of the World's Largest Tobacco Companies Is Struggling; Pyxus International, with almost $1 billion in near-term debt, is facing a cash crunch. Efforts to move into vaping and cannabis have hit roadblocks.

Pyxus International Inc., one of the world's largest suppliers of tobacco, is facing mounting financial pressure from a decline in its core business and setbacks in its efforts to diversify into cannabis and vaping fluids.
The North Carolina-based company, which changed its name from Alliance One International in 2018, is facing a cash crunch as losses mount and roughly $1 billion in debt maturities loom. The company's financial problems highlight declining global tobacco consumption coupled with both regulatory uncertainty and heightened competition in the emerging recreational marijuana and vaping sectors.
Pyxus's big problem is that its core business—buying tobacco directly from farmers and then reselling it to major cigarette makers such as Philip Morris—is in decline. Global tobacco use has fallen over the past two decades, according to the World Health Organization. Altria Group Inc., which owns Philip Morris USA Inc., said last month that global cigarette industry volumes have contracted by 4% to 5.5% annually for the last several years. U.S. volumes are forecast to decline by 4% to 6% in 2020.
The numbers are stark. For its most recent quarter Pyxus's revenue declined 31% to $363 million and the company lost $22 million. Pyxus has roughly $900 million of bonds maturing in the next year and its $635 million in second-lien bonds are trading at 48 cents on the dollar, according to MarketAxess. The deeply distressed price levels for its debt indicate concerns the company won't be able to refinance its debt. The company has $396 million of available credit lines and cash on its balance sheet, down by 25% from the $528 million a year ago.
Pieter Sikkel, Pyxus's chief executive, believes the tobacco company is making headway in its bid to become a diversified agricultural technology and consumer products goods company.
"We're excited by the progress we've made across categories and by the growth potential on the horizon," he said. "We have benefited from the progress of our diversification strategy, innovation efforts, and global presence."
Pyxus, which traces its roots to a tobacco trading business founded in Virginia in 1873, has attempted to diversify by acquiring stakes in companies that deal in legal cannabis, CBD, industrial hemp, and e-liquids for vaping. However, the diversification bid hasn't yet paid off.
"They're not successful at their core tobacco business so they try to pivot into the cannabis space," said Alan Brochstein, founder of 420Investor.com. "Pyxus seems to be going at it from a position of weakness."
The Pyxus segment that contains its cannabis and e-liquids businesses saw its revenue decline by 24.5% year-over-year for the most recent quarter. The company pointed to a slower-than-expected rollout of legal cannabis retail availability in Canada, as well as a decrease in vaping e-liquids sales due to an industry downturn driven by health and regulatory concerns after a series of vaping deaths .
The combination of setbacks in the cannabis sector, delayed shipments due to a drought in Africa, and the impact of the trade wars has created a "perfect storm" for the company as its debt maturities approach next year, said Mary Ross Gilbert, a managing director at investment bank Imperial Capital LLC.
"And now we have the coronavirus. That's the cherry on top of this perfect storm," Mrs. Gilbert said.
Mr. Sikkel blamed the declining financial performance on poor shipment timing, delayed processing in Africa, and the impact of trade disputes and foreign tariffs.
U.S. tobacco sales to China have fallen dramatically during the two-year trade war, leaving many farmers hoping that the recently signed Phase 1 deal with Beijing will provide them with relief.
"While we are pleased that tobacco is included on the list of agricultural products in Phase 1 of the U.S.-China trade agreement, additional steps are needed to restart leaf exports from the United States to China," Mr. Sikkel said, adding that the company is closely monitoring the coronavirus.
As for the company's mixed results on cannabis and vaping e-liquids, Mr. Sikkel likened the company's diversification efforts to growing pains associated with a startup business.
"Our newer initiatives are in the process of being scaled to their full potential—we think of them as being in 'startup mode'—and are evolving quickly across these nascent industries," Mr. Sikkel told The Wall Street Journal.
In a nod to the looming debt maturities, Mr. Sikkel recently said Pyxus is evaluating a "potential partial monetization of interests" in the company's cannabis and e-liquids segment. Mr. Sikkel declined to elaborate.
However, Pyxus's prospects for obtaining an attractive price for its assets could be hindered by the recent collapse in cannabis company valuations , analysts said. Publicly listed cannabis companies such as Canopy Growth Corp., Tilray Inc., and Cronos Group Inc. have all seen their stock prices decline over the past six months, because of oversupply and weaker-than-expected demand.

World News: Sales Tax and Virus Hit Japan Economy

TOKYO -- Following a dismal final quarter of 2019, Japan's economy is facing the risk of a recession because the coronavirus outbreak is hurting tourism and production.
Japan, the world's third-largest economy after the U.S. and China, contracted at an annualized rate of 6.3% in the October-December quarter, worse than economists' forecast of a 3.9% contraction. The biggest reason was a sharp drop in private consumption after the national sales tax rose to 10% on Oct. 1 from 8%.
"Because of the effects of the novel coronavirus, weakness in consumption will likely continue in the January-March period. Exports and production could be dreadfully weak as the supply chain is interrupted," said Daiwa Securities economist Mari Iwashita.
Some economists, including Ms. Iwashita, say Japan could fall into a technical recession -- two straight quarters of contraction -- this quarter. The contraction in the October-December quarter was the first in more than a year and the biggest since the April-June quarter in 2014, the last time the sales tax was raised.
The virus has hit Chinese tourism in Japan and disrupted some manufacturing in the country that depends on Chinese parts.
Sales at Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd.'s three flagship department stores in Tokyo fell about 20% during the Lunar New Year holiday between Jan. 24 and Jan. 30 compared with the previous year. The holiday has been a popular time for Chinese tourists to travel abroad.
Chinese accounted for about 37% of the $44 billion in spending by tourists in Japan last year.
The International Civil Aviation Organization estimates that Japan could lose $1.29 billion in tourism revenue in the first quarter because of fewer Chinese air travelers. In central Japan's Shizuoka prefecture, home to hot-spring resorts and a portion of Mount Fuji, more than 90,000 tourists, mainly Chinese, canceled their hotel reservations through March, according to the Shizuoka Prefectural Tourism Association.
Daiwa's Ms. Iwashita expects the economy to shrink an annualized 0.5% in the first quarter, but the figure could worsen if a production slowdown in China hits Japanese factories more widely.
Some economists are calling for government spending of tens of billions of dollars to make up the losses.
"The Japanese government needs to state its intention to clearly shift toward fiscal expansion and prepare further economic measures by issuing a large amount of new government bonds," said Takuji Aida, a Societe General economist in Tokyo. "If the economy falls back again into a huge recession and fails to get out of deflation, any more sales-tax increase would be almost impossible."

Investors' renewed demand for speculative-grade corporate loans is proving to be a boon for businesses, allowing them to slash billions of dollars in borrowing costs in one of the biggest refinancing waves on record.
So far this year, businesses ranging from retailer BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. to power generator Calpine Corp. have lowered the interest rates on some $117 billion of loans. That includes $95 billion in January, the second-largest monthly total in records going back to 2002, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence.
One reason why businesses sometimes prefer issuing loans, rather than bonds, is that they are relatively easy to refinance. Companies with speculative-grade credit ratings often are prevented from refinancing bonds for at least three years after they sell them. But they typically face only a small charge for refinancing speculative-grade, or leveraged, loans within six months of a sale and no penalty after that.
And, rather than issue new loans to replace old ones, they can simply ask investors to accept lower interest rates on their existing loans, in a practice known as repricing.
Investors can refuse. But they typically don't when demand for loans is strong.
As with other types of riskier assets, from stocks to speculative-grade bonds, loans have been lifted in recent months by investors' growing confidence that the U.S. economy is on solid footing -- thanks in part to improved U.S.-China trade relations and promises of support from Federal Reserve officials.
Though the coronavirus's spread has recently dented some of that confidence, demand for loans has remained sturdy enough that companies have continued to request lower rates from investors.
Especially with interest rates low around the world, "money is trying to find a place to generate returns," said Serhan Secmen, a portfolio manager at Napier Park Global Capital. "Not the Australian fires, not the coronavirus, not the potential Middle-East quagmire with Iran" have been enough to significantly slow markets this year.
The recent wave of repricings is particularly notable because loans underperformed other risky assets for much of last year. While stocks climbed to records, the extra yield, or spread, that investors were demanding to hold loans above their benchmark interest rates increased for all but the highest-rated loans.
Demand for loans last year was hurt in part by an uptick in financial stress among low-rated borrowers, caused by everything from opioid lawsuits to a decline in oil prices. A series of interest-rate cuts by the Fed also played a role, because loan coupons are pegged to underlying interest rates and individual investors typically flee from loan mutual-funds when rates are falling.
Increased interest in loans is a sign that some, if not all, of the challenges facing borrowers have stabilized. It also reflects the Fed's recent move to take a wait-and-see approach to reducing interest rates.
The lowest-rated loans have been the best performers in recent months. The average spread on triple-C rated loans in the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index has fallen to 11.9 percentage points above the London interbank offered rate from 13.9 percentage points in early November, while the spread on higher-rated double-B loans has slipped roughly 0.1 percentage point to 2.7 percentage points.
Some investors have been a little surprised by the volume of repricings given that the loan market remains weaker than it was during past refinancing booms.
Typically, repricings happen in large numbers when the percentage of loans trading at or above par is around 65% or higher, said Drew Sweeney, a loan trader and portfolio manager at TCW Group. Yet that number was a little below 50% in January, according to LCD.
Even so, many portfolio managers would rather accept a lower interest rate than have their loan repaid and be forced to either hold more cash or find a new loan.
"There's an avalanche of repricings, so you can't say no to all of them," Mr. Sweeney said.
Not all companies have won consent from investors to reprice their loans. Some lower-rated companies faced resistance in the last week of January when investors were particularly nervous about the coronavirus.
Software and analytics firm Change Healthcare Holdings Inc. failed to win support from investors to lower the interest rate on its $3.8 billion loan, which has a coupon of Libor plus 2.5 percentage points. The internet-services provider Web.com Group Inc. also couldn't reprice its $998 million loan, which has a coupon of Libor plus 3.75 percentage points.
Among the many successful companies, BJ's Wholesale Club was able to reduce the interest rate on its $1.3 billion loan to Libor plus 2.25 percentage points from Libor plus 3 percentage points, while Calpine cut the interest rate on its $980 million loan to Libor plus 2 percentage points from Libor plus 2.5 percentage points.

Hundreds of Americans who had been passengers on a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship in Japan landed in the U.S. on Monday, including 14 people who tested positive for the virus and were allowed to join the evacuation operation at the last minute.
The number of virus cases aboard the Diamond Princess ship rose to 454 -- about one in eight of those originally on the ship -- prompting more questions about whether Japan made the outbreak worse by confining potential virus carriers in a narrow space that wasn't designed for a long-term quarantine.
The efforts to get people off the cruise ship come as the virus continues to disrupt global supply chains that rely on China, the epicenter of the outbreak, and daily life in many parts of the country. The Chinese government reported more than 72,000 cases on the mainland, with more than 1,860 deaths. Only three deaths and 794 cases have occurred outside of China, the World Health Organization has said, with the majority of those cases aboard the Diamond Princess.
Fourteen of the cruise-ship passengers who tested positive for the novel coronavirus were among the Americans who arrived home Monday in two chartered cargo jets. One landed at Travis Air Force Base near Sacramento, Calif., while the other arrived at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.
Ten infected passengers, as well as some of their spouses, were flown on to Omaha, where they were brought to the University of Nebraska for additional monitoring. The remaining patients were brought to hospitals near Travis Air Force Base, State Department officials said.
None of the 14 infected passengers showed symptoms of the virus, such as sore throats or coughing, the officials said.
The U.S. initially said no one with the virus would be allowed on the flights. But on the bus ride from the ship to the airport, word arrived that 14 passengers in the group had tested positive based on tests conducted two days before the evacuation, U.S. officials said.
Rather than turn them back, officials decided to seat the 14 in an isolated section apart from other plane passengers, according to a joint statement by the State Department and the Department of Health and Human Services.
"Infection prevention and control measures are difficult to implement in a ship environment," said Sylvie Briand, the WHO director of global infectious hazard preparedness.
Meanwhile, the remaining Americans who tested negative must serve out two weeks of quarantine in the U.S. after nearly two weeks quarantined aboard the cruise ship, which remains docked in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, with more than 2,000 people aboard.
As of Friday, there were 15 cases of the virus in the U.S., the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
The number of cases in Japan unrelated to the cruise has jumped to more than 60 in recent days, including doctors and nurses who treated earlier victims. Fearing a greater spread in the general population, the Tokyo Marathon on Monday canceled public entries because of the coronavirus outbreak, cutting more than 30,000 runners from one of the biggest races in the world. Only around 200 elite runners will now be allowed to take part in the March 1 race.
About 380 Americans and family members of Americans were on board the Diamond Princess when the quarantine started Feb. 5. Some who had earlier tested positive for the virus remain in Japan in hospitals across the Tokyo region.
The last-minute discovery of infected passengers bound for the chartered flights caused hours of delay.
Amy Ellefson, 73 years old, from Eden Prairie, Minn., estimated it took an hour and a half to board the plane, after which passengers were asked to disembark and start all over again. It was a "nightmarish journey," Ms. Ellefson said.
Japan is testing everyone aboard the cruise ship before they disembark. Its health ministry said Monday that an additional 99 people aboard the ship have tested positive for the virus, bringing the total to 454. Russia said one of its citizens was in that group, the first Russian diagnosed with the virus.
Health ministry official Yosuke Kita said the ministry was on track to finish most of the testing by Wednesday, the day the two-week quarantine ends. He said as many as 1,000 passengers might be able to leave the ship that day, and most of the other passengers will be allowed to go on shore by Friday.
Dr. Masahiro Kami, an expert in infectious diseases, said once it was clear that the number of virus cases on the ship was growing fast, the government should have rushed to test everyone and released everyone who tested negative. Some people who tested negative later tested positive, so such a step could have exposed people in the community to virus carriers, but Dr. Kami said that was a risk worth taking because the virus was likely already spreading in Japan.
Shigeru Omi, a former WHO official who is helping Japan respond to the virus outbreak, said early data suggested the number of cruise passengers newly acquiring the infection dropped quickly after Feb. 5, when the quarantine started.
Still, Dr. Omi said the Diamond Princess "was not designed for isolation for several weeks." He said crew members, who circulated on board during the quarantine to deliver food and do other work, continued to get infected at a worrisome rate.
"The goal was to keep service going," said a waiter on board, who has developed a cough and was waiting Monday for his test results.

After allowing a stranded cruise ship to dock in Cambodia on Thursday, Prime Minister Hun Sen greeted disembarking passengers with warm handshakes and red roses.
It looked like a savvy photo op by the wily authoritarian, who instantly pleased both his closest ally, China, and his most powerful critic, the United States. Several countries had denied entry to the Holland America Line ship, the Westerdam, because of fears that passengers or crew could be carrying the novel coronavirus, although company officials said no one on board was infected.
The risks of the Cambodian leader's gesture became apparent after an 83-year-old American passenger tested positive for the virus in Malaysia after she and hundreds of others left Cambodia en route to their home countries.
The announcement sent company officials, governments and medical experts scrambling to trace passengers who had dispersed to multiple countries -- highlighting the challenge of containing a virus that often fails to trigger symptoms and is circling the globe.
"We are in close coordination with some of the leading health experts from around the world," said Grant Tarling, Holland America's chief medical officer. "These experts are working with the appropriate national health authorities to investigate and follow up with any individuals who may have come in contact with the guest."
The American woman, who didn't report feeling ill until after she left Cambodia, was in stable condition at a hospital in Malaysia, Holland America said Monday. Her 85-year-old husband has tested negative for the virus.
The company said that out of 2,257 passengers and crew members -- including more than 650 Americans -- only 20 reported feeling ill during the voyage and were tested for the virus. All tests came back negative.
Hundreds of passengers disembarked at the port of Sihanoukville without being screened.
"Obviously in hindsight, this was a mistake," said Charles Chiu, a professor of infectious diseases at UC San Francisco.
Chiu said that more precautions should have been taken in Cambodia given that the epidemic is in its early stages and can still be controlled. The crowded spaces and communal facilities on cruise ships make it easy for disease to spread among passengers. On the Diamond Princess cruise liner quarantined off Japan, 454 people have tested positive for the coronavirus.
"Now that the passengers have either gone home or continued traveling in other countries, this only magnifies the global public health challenge of tracking and performing contact tracing for each and every one of the passengers," Chiu said of the Westerdam. "Self-quarantine measures for 14 days would need to be rigorously enforced to prevent spread by anyone else who may have been infected."
Thailand said Monday that for 14 days it wouldn't let in anyone who had been aboard the Westerdam. Malaysia blocked further arrivals. Singapore placed two nationals who had returned from the cruise in a government quarantine facility and said it wouldn't allow any other passengers in.
Passengers temporarily stopped disembarking from the Westerdam, and those who were in hotels were asked to stay in their rooms until they were tested for the virus and cleared.
Christina Kerby, a passenger from Alameda, Calif., who had been tweeting updates about her trip, disembarked and flew on Saturday to Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. That evening, she gleefully posted pictures of her dinner of seafood and beer at a local bar, Nelsons. The next morning, she said Cambodian health officials had asked passengers to stay in their rooms "pending further health screenings."
"I left the hotel for a few hours on Saturday before I knew the extent of our situation," Kerby tweeted Monday. "I deeply regret if I've inadvertently put anyone at risk."
All passengers in Phnom Penh were tested for the virus, and no new infections had been reported as of Monday evening, according to Holland America. Those who were virus-free were able to travel home. About 1,000 people -- mostly crew members -- were still being screened aboard the ship.
More than 73,300 people have been infected with the coronavirus since it surfaced in December in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, and more than 1,870 have died. Although the vast majority of cases have occurred in China, infections have appeared in more than two dozen countries, showing how the virus has spread silently through global travel.
"It's a gamble Cambodia was making in allowing Westerdam to dock," said Ou Virak, president of Future Forum, a Cambodian think tank.
Still, he praised Hun Sen's decision on humanitarian grounds, saying that many other countries were reacting to the outbreak with "hysteria."
The cruise liner had been at sea for two weeks and turned away by ports in at least five countries, including the U.S. territory of Guam, after concerns were raised that travelers could have been exposed to the virus from the journey's origin point of Hong Kong. The ship was reportedly running low on supplies when the Cambodian government granted it permission to dock in Sihanoukville.
Hun Sen had several reasons to be hospitable. China is his country's No. 1 trading partner, and from the outset the Cambodian leader has played down the threat of the virus.
He has opted not to evacuate Cambodians from Wu-han, and he declined to wear a mask to guard against infection -- even threatening to boot journalists from a news conference if they failed to follow his lead. "What is more terrible than the epidemic is the panic itself," Hun Sen told Chinese leader Xi Jinping during a visit to Beijing this month.
"People will of course question whether Hun Sen is doing this under pressure from China or of his own accord," Ou Virak said. "I think it's a combination of both."
Allowing the ship to dock also deflected attention from a diplomatic blow Hun Sen suffered last week, when the European Union partially suspended Cambodia's trade privileges, citing serious violations of civil, political and labor rights.
President Trump hailed "the beautiful country of Cambodia" and tweeted, "The U.S. will remember your courtesy."
The U.S. Embassy's social media accounts have been full of praise for the Cambodian government, a departure from recent years, when the State Department has sharply criticized Hun Sen's moves to ban opposition parties, silence independent media and block public assemblies.
"The close, positive, and public collaboration between the Cambodian government and the U.S. Embassy on the docking has ultimately turned this into something of a high point," said Bradley Jensen Murg, assistant professor of political science at Seattle Pacific University.
Some Cambodians were worried about exposure to the virus. Several journalists who covered the arrival of the passengers said they were isolating themselves, although none reported showing symptoms.
Cambodian officials continued to play the cheerful host. The governor of Phnom Penh on Monday took some passengers on a bus tour. Hun Sen said he wanted to throw them a party.
The country had reported one coronavirus infection before the Westerdam, but some Cambodians are skeptical of that figure given a huge volume of Chinese travelers, a weak health system and the virus' ability to evade detection.
Paul Ananth Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said Cambodia and Malaysia played their roles and now other countries would have to track the ship's passengers.
"I think that this was a very difficult decision, as keeping the ship at sea or in the harbor is not a viable option," Tambyah said. "Someone has to take the passengers ashore and send them somewhere else."

More than 300 American cruise ship passengers, including 14 who tested positive for coronavirus, were being quarantined at military bases in California and Texas on Monday after arriving from Japan on charter flights overnight. 
One plane carrying cruise passengers touched down at Travis Air Force Base in Northern California just before midnight Sunday, while another arrived at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas early Monday.
The passengers will remain at the bases for two weeks.
Japan's Defense Minister Taro Kono tweeted earlier that Japanese troops helped transport 340 U.S. passengers on 14 buses from Yokohama port to Tokyo's Haneda airport.
About 380 Americans were on the cruise ship.
The U.S. said it arranged for the evacuation because people on the Diamond Princess were at a high risk of exposure to the new virus that has been spreading in Asia.
For the departing Americans, the evacuation cuts short a 14-day quarantine that began aboard the cruise ship Feb. 5.
The State Department announced later that 14 of the evacuees received confirmation they had the virus but were allowed to board the flight because they had no symptoms.
They were being kept isolated from other passengers on the flight, the U.S. State Department and Department of Health and Human Services said in a joint statement.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, said Sunday that an infected person who shows minimal symptoms could still pass the virus to someone else.
It's unclear which base the 14 who tested positive for the virus went to.
Officials said the evacuees who arrived at Travis Air Force Base will be housed at a different location from the more than 200 other Americans who were already being quarantined on the base, in a hotel. Those people have been at the base since early February, when they arrived on flights from China.
Now that they're in the U.S., the cruise ship passengers must go through another 14 days of quarantine at the military facilities -- meaning they will have been under quarantine for a total of nearly four weeks.
Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and Italy were planning similar flights of passengers. Other governments, including Canada and Hong Kong, also will require the passengers to undergo a second 14-day quarantine.
Japan on Monday announced 99 more infections on the Diamond Princess, raising the ship's total number of cases to 454. Overall, Japan has 419 confirmed cases of the virus, including one death.
The United States has confirmed 15 cases within the country. Separately, one U.S. citizen died in China.
Americans Cheryl and Paul Molesky, from Syracuse, New York, opted to trade one coronavirus quarantine for another, leaving the cruise ship to fly back to the U.S. Cheryl Molesky said the rising number of patients on the ship factored into the decision.
"We are glad to be going home," Cheryl Molesky earlier told NHK TV in Japan. "It's just a little bit disappointing that we'll have to go through quarantine again, and we will probably not be as comfortable as the Diamond Princess, possibly."
Some American passengers said they would pass up the opportunity to fly to the United States because of the additional quarantine. There also was worry about being on a long flight with other passengers who may be infected or in an incubation period.
Chinese health authorities on Tuesday reported 1,886 new cases of the virus and 98 more deaths, raising totals in mainland China to 72,436 people infected and 1,868 deaths.
In Beijing, Communist Party authorities said Monday the government may postpone its annual congress in March, its biggest political meeting of the year, as the military dispatched hundreds more medical workers and extra supplies to the city hit hardest by a 2-month-old virus outbreak.
The standing committee for the National People's Congress said it believes it is necessary to postpone the gathering to give top priority to people's lives, safety and health, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
The standing committee said it would meet Monday to further deliberate on a postponement.
The meeting is due to start March 5.

Growth Investors Face Test of Their Mettle

The revenue warning issued on Monday by Apple Inc. is another test of investors' long-running love affair with so-called growth stocks.
For weeks, investors have bet that the giant technology stocks that have led the market would march on despite the disruption and economic slowdown in China caused by the coronavirus. They've continued to put their faith in companies that promise rapidly increasing profits and revenue.
"Investors believe they're better positioned to weather any economic storm," said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co., speaking of growth stocks. "Even if there's a recession, people will keep using Facebook."
Investors could take Apple's warning on Monday that it won't meet revenue expectations for the current quarter as a sign that the growth stock run is over. Or they could see the downturn as temporary and specific to Apple.
Apple was the most vulnerable of the popular tech giants, which include Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc., because these companies are software and cloud-computer providers. Apple depends on a sophisticated supply chain that runs through Chinese factories to produce its physical products, including the iPhone.
Either way, growth stocks like Apple are susceptible to a downturn. The big names are sitting on double-digit gains in 2020 and have powered 45% of the S&P 500's total return, which reflects price changes and dividend payments, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
The index has set 12 record closes this year as it has risen 4.6%, or 4.9% when including dividends.
The growth rally has been a shift from the fall when value stocks -- those that tend to trade at low prices relative to their earnings or net assets -- outperformed growth shares and pundits predicted their long-awaited rebound had arrived after years of disappointing returns. Those hopes were buoyed by three interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve that were expected to spur a rally in bank stocks and other traditional value plays.
Even through periods of turmoil, investors have stuck with growth stocks. Markets have been rattled even before the coronavirus outbreak, which has sickened tens of thousands of people around the world and crimped business activity. The slowdown pushed oil prices into a bear market and drove investors to traditionally safer bets like U.S. Treasurys. Before that, there were tensions between the U.S. and Iran.
Investors appear confident growth stocks can survive these challenges. Many are eager to hold on to stocks they view as enduring winners of a period of technology disruption. And despite their dramatic rally, valuations among tech giants aren't approaching the levels seen during the dot-com bubble.
As they grapple with a murky outlook, investors will turn their attention this week to the Fed's latest meeting minutes and fresh reads on manufacturing. Meanwhile, results from Walmart Inc. on Tuesday will offer new insight into the health of the consumer.
The run in value stocks "was short lived," said Joe Fath, portfolio manager for U.S. growth stock strategy at T. Rowe Price. "There's a number of crosscurrents that are driving what you've seen."
The MSCI USA Growth index has returned 9% this year, while the MSCI USA Value Index added 1% through Thursday.
The divergence between growth and value shares has been wide since the financial crisis. Over the long run, value stocks have earned better returns than their growth peers, and some investors say it is only a matter of time before growth stocks' reign ends.
The recent shift has given extra fuel to the market's star performers and punished shares of financial and energy companies, which typically are in the value category. Financial stocks have struggled to keep pace with the broader market this year, rising 0.9% in the S&P 500, as yields have dropped in the wake of the outbreak. Higher yields tend to improve banks' lending profitability.
Meanwhile, the slide in oil prices has hit energy shares. The S&P 500's energy sector has declined 10.2% this year, the biggest drop among the 11 groups in the index.
As these sectors have muddled through, big tech companies, which have become nearly synonymous with growth in recent years, have continued to stand out. The S&P 500's tech sector is up 11% this year, leading the way as it has for much of the decadelong bull run.

CITY &amp; STATE; 14 of Americans evacuated from ship have virus

U.S. officials said early Monday that 14 American passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan had tested positive for the new coronavirus, but were allowed on flights to military bases in California and Texas.
The State Department chartered the flights to transport more than 300 U.S. citizens from the ship, which had been docked off Yokohama since Feb. 3. The passengers landed Monday at Travis Air Force Base in Solano County, although some will continue on to Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland. All will face a 14-day quarantine on the bases.
The 14 infected passengers had been tested two to three days before the evacuation, but officials received notice of the positive results after they had left the ship for the airport, the U.S. Departments of State and Health and Human Services said in a joint statement.
The passengers did not display symptoms, the statement added. They were isolated in a specialized containment area on the aircraft. All passengers were to be closely monitored by medical personnel during the flights and moved to the containment area if they showed symptoms, officials said.
Those who stay at Travis Air Force Base will be housed separately from the 234 people already quarantined there after arriving on previous evacuation flights that landed Feb. 5 and Feb. 7, officials said.
The Diamond Princess set sail Jan. 20 and was placed under quarantine by Japanese officials on Feb. 5 after a passenger who departed the cruise ship in Hong Kong tested positive for the coronavirus.
"We understand this is frustrating and an adjustment, but these measures are consistent with the careful policies we have instituted to limit the potential spread of the disease," the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said in a letter sent to cruise ship passengers Saturday.
So far, no positive coronavirus results have been reported among those quarantined earlier at Travis; one case has been reported among those quarantined at Lackland. The virus has killed more than 1,870 people and infected more than 73,300 since it was discovered in Wuhan, China, in late December.
Travis is one of three military bases in California that the Defense Department has designated as sites to house returning coronavirus evacuees. The others are Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego County, where 232 people are currently quarantined, and March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County. About 195 people were permitted to leave from there last week after completing a 14-day quarantine.
The move to transport the American cruise ship passengers came as the number of coronavirus cases aboard the Diamond Princess continued to grow over the weekend, with 67 new diagnoses on Saturday, and the U.S. government issued a recommendation that all American passengers and crew members leave.
"We are deeply grateful to the cruise line and government of Japan for working diligently to contain and control the spread of the illness," the letter from the U.S. Embassy said. "However, to fulfill our government's responsibilities to U.S. citizens under our rules and practices, as well as to reduce the burden on the Japanese healthcare system, the U.S. government recommends, out of an abundance of caution, that U.S. citizens disembark and return to the United States for further monitoring."
The 3,700 passengers and crew members aboard the Diamond Princess include two Santa Clarita residents, Carl Goldman and his wife, Jeri Seratti Goldman. The couple own the radio station KHTS and have been documenting their experiences in a diary on the station's website.
Many of the posts have been lighthearted, but on Saturday, Carl Goldman wrote that one of their traveling companions had been diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus.
"It's a sad day aboard the Diamond Princess," he wrote. "No joking today."
The woman, Jerri Jorgenson, and her husband, Mark, were confined to the cabin adjoining the Goldmans', and the two couples had unlocked a partition separating their balconies so they could move freely back and forth between the units during the quarantine, Carl Goldman wrote.
"Last night, after watching a movie, all four of us took our temperatures. Jerri had a fever," he wrote. "In the morning, she still had a fever. As Mark and Jerri were getting ready to call the ship's hospital, Japanese health officials knocked on their door. They were dressed in hazmat suits."
He said that they handed Mark Jorgenson a letter saying that his wife had tested positive for the virus and said she had one hour to pack a small bag. She was taken by ambulance to a hospital about four hours away in Fukushima, where her husband was not permitted to join her, Goldman wrote.
Goldman, his wife and Mark Jorgenson were planning to fly back to the U.S. on one of the evacuation flights and undergo a second quarantine at one of the military bases, Goldman wrote.
"We are unclear what tomorrow will bring," he wrote. "We are shaken and devastated that we have been removed from our friend."
Health officials say that the COVID-19 virus continues to pose a low risk to the general American public. Just 15 cases had been diagnosed in the U.S.: eight in California, two in Illinois, and one each in Arizona, Massachusetts, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.

Tokyo Marathon Closes to Public Participants; Nearly 30,000 runners are cut from the March 1 event, which only will accept elite entrants

TOKYO—The Tokyo Marathon closed itself to public entries because of the coronavirus outbreak , cutting more than 30,000 runners less than two weeks before the event.
Only about 200 elite runners will now be allowed to take part in the March 1 race. "We cannot continue to launch the event within the scale we originally anticipated" because of the spread of the virus in Japan, the event organizers said in a statement.
The cancellation adds to a growing list of sports events affected by the virus, which originated in central China and has now spread to countries around the world. The Formula One Chinese Grand Prix, scheduled for April, has been postponed, and some qualifying events for the Tokyo Summer Olympics this year have been delayed or moved.
Japan has reported cases of the virus in locations across the country, including in Tokyo. Organizers for the Tokyo Olympics said last week they weren't considering any changes to the schedule for the Games, due to start on July 24.
Tracking the Coronavirus
* 14 Americans repatriated to the U.S. from the Diamond Princess tested positive for the virus.
* An additional 99 people aboard the ship tested positive for the virus on Monday, bringing the total to 454.
* Beijing is weighing plans to postpone its biggest political assembly as the government races to contain the coronavirus epidemic.
Julia Church, from Adelaide in Australia, was scheduled to take part in the Tokyo marathon this year with her husband. Ms. Church had hoped to achieve a common goal among distance runners of completing the world's six biggest marathons by joining the Tokyo race this year and the Boston Marathon next year.
She said she cried when she heard the news but understands the reasons for the cancellation.
"Months of preparation and training and careful logistical planning to make these trips work all comes to an abrupt end," she said. "It's such a shame, but we can't stay angry for long."
The Tokyo Marathon organizers said registered runners would be able to defer their entry until next year but would have to pay entry fees again. Last week, the event asked registered runners from China to instead join the race in 2021.

BHP First-Half Profit Rises; Dividend Lifted; Directors declared interim dividend of 65 cents a share, up from an ordinary payout of 55 cents a year ago

SYDNEY—BHP Group Ltd. reported a 29% rise in half-year net profit and lifted its dividend, after strong prices of iron ore more than offset weakness among almost all other commodities that it produces.
BHP, the world's largest listed miner by market value, said it made a net profit of $4.87 billion in the six months through December, up from $3.76 billion a year earlier. Earnings improved despite a $318 million drag from canceled power contracts at two copper mines in Chile as BHP shifts toward running the operations fully on renewable energy, and costs tied to the Samarco dam failure in Brazil several years ago.
Underlying profit from continuing operations was up 29% at $5.19 billion, broadly in line with the $5.22 billion median estimate compiled by FactSet and The Wall Street Journal.
Tuesday's result was the first delivered by Mike Henry since he succeeded Andrew Mackenzie as BHP's chief executive at the start of January. Mr. Henry, a veteran BHP executive who ran the Australian minerals division for more than three years, took the helm at a time when major resources companies are being pressed by investors to map out clearer strategies for growth while balancing benefits to shareholders through dividends and other forms of capital management.
Directors of BHP declared an interim dividend of 65 cents a share, up from an ordinary payout of 55 cents a share a year ago, but opted against using surplus cash to pay a special dividend as well. Net debt rose to $12.84 billion at the end of December.
"The dividend reflects the solid cash flow generated in the period, caution due to near-term market volatility driven by the 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak, trade policy and geopolitics, and our preference for net debt to be at the bottom end of the US$12 to US$17 billion target range," BHP said.
BHP has benefited from a tailwind of high iron-ore prices as the market responded to reduced supply in Brazil following a deadly spill of mining waste at an operation owned by Vale SA early last year. BHP last month said its iron ore fetched an average price of $78.30 a metric ton in the six months through December, up 41% from a year earlier.
However, the coronavirus outbreak in recent weeks has weighed on iron-ore prices, as China idled manufacturing as part of a strategy to contain its spread. Morgan Stanley estimated that more than 40 blast furnaces have been taken offline temporarily with the potential loss of 80 million tons of annualized iron-ore demand—enough to tip the market into surplus.
Mining executives and investors will be watchful for any new moves by Beijing to stimulate the national economy once the virus is contained, as this could stoke demand for resources. China is the world's top buyer of many commodities, accounting for around 60% of the trade in iron ore by sea.
"Despite near-term uncertainty—due to the coronavirus outbreak, trade policy and geopolitics—we remain convinced about the positive underlying fundamentals of our commodities," Mr. Henry said.
BHP dug up 121 million tons of iron ore in the six months through December and expects its share of production to total between 242 million tons and 253 million tons in the 2020 fiscal year. Copper output has also been rising, although oil and gas production in the half-year period was affected by the impact of Tropical Storm Barry in the Gulf of Mexico along with some fields becoming less productive as they approach the end of their life.

Dubai to Delist Global Port Operator DP World; Deal comes as the emirate faces another looming debt crisis

DUBAI—Dubai plans to delist its global port operator and return it to full state ownership in a deal that would help the emirate repay billions of dollars in debt.
The emirate—which was bailed out by neighboring Abu Dhabi following a financial crisis in 2009—is again facing economic turmoil. Real-estate prices have fallen sharply since 2015, driven by oversupply and weakened consumer sentiment on lower oil prices and geopolitical tensions.
It faces another looming debt crisis. In September, Fitch Ratings said the emirate and its state-related entities could be forced to restructure a significant portion of $23 billion in loans maturing through 2021.
The deal involves DP World, one of the largest operators of ports and terminals around the globe.
State-owned Port and Free Zone World is set to buy the 19.55% it doesn't already own in DP World by acquiring shares listed on the Nasdaq Dubai exchange for $2.7 billion, both companies said in a statement. The deal values DP World at $13.9 billion.

* Once Billed as a Financial Haven in the Middle East, Dubai Turns Investors Wary (Aug. 2, 2018)
PFZW is owned by Dubai World, the investment vehicle of the emirate's government. As part of the deal, PFZW will also pay $5.15 billion to Dubai World to help repay its owner's debts, the statement said.
The payment is required, the parties said, to ensure the ports operator isn't subject to restrictions imposed on Dubai World by its creditors, though they didn't detail those restrictions.
PFZW will finance the transaction via new debt facilities arranged by Citibank and Deutsche Bank AG, according to the statement. As a result, DP World will be a guarantor of an expected further $8.1 billion of debt, PFZW and DP World said in the statement.
DP World, one of Dubai's most successful companies, has itself suffered from recent global trade tensions and now faces the threat of further disruption from the outbreak of the coronavirus in China .
Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chairman and chief executive of DP World, in a statement said that private ownership would free the firm from the public market's demands for short-term returns, which he said are incompatible with the ports industry.
But Moody's Investors Service said it would review DP World's credit rating for a possible downgrade, saying the additional debt required for the transaction and the payment to Dubai World would be a "material deviation from the group's self-imposed financial policy."
Dubai World was at the heart of the Dubai government's crisis-era woes in 2009 when it called a standstill on debts and began negotiations with banks to restructure about $25 billion of loans.
The conglomerate had borrowed heavily to fund eye-catching real-estate projects and investments, including a palm-tree-shaped island off the coast of the emirate. It was caught by surprise when banks suddenly weren't willing to refinance loans following the global financial crisis, which left Dubai's real-estate market in a downturn.
Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, which includes Dubai, subsequently provided $10 billion to its neighbor to help meet some of its debt obligations.
State-owned developers have again been on a building spree, driving down property prices, ahead of hosting a world exposition later this year. Dubai officials hope the event, called Expo 2020 and focused on science, innovation and entertainment, will attract 25 million visitors over a six-month period and boost state revenue.
Dubai's economy, which is largely based on trade, tourism and retail, could suffer in the short term from the global fallout of the coronavirus, according to S&P Global. The ratings firm warned Monday that Gulf economies were susceptible to falling oil prices caused by lower demand from China as a result of the virus.
The U.A.E. has the highest contribution from Chinese nationals to airline traffic, tourism, retail, of all of the Gulf states, S&P said. However, the impact of the virus on Gulf economies will be limited should it be contained by March, the firm added.
DP World earlier this month reported a 1% like-for-like increase in 2019 container volumes across its network compared with a year earlier. The company said it was operating in a challenging market, caused by the trade war between the U.S. and China and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.
DP World shares were up 10% at $14.30 on Monday.

Companies Seize on Loan Demand With Near-Record Refinancing Push; Demand has allowed businesses to cut billions of dollars in borrowing costs

Investors' renewed demand for speculative-grade corporate loans is proving to be a boon for businesses, allowing them to slash billions of dollars in borrowing costs in one of the biggest refinancing waves on record.
So far this year, businesses ranging from retailer BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. to power generator Calpine Corp. have lowered the interest rates on some $117 billion of loans. That includes $95 billion in January, the second-largest monthly total in records going back to 2002, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence.
One reason why businesses sometimes prefer issuing loans, rather than bonds, is that they are relatively easy to refinance. Companies with speculative-grade credit ratings often are prevented from refinancing bonds for at least three years after they sell them. But they typically face only a small charge for refinancing speculative-grade, or leveraged, loans within six months of a sale and no penalty after that.
And, rather than issue new loans to replace old ones, they can simply ask investors to accept lower interest rates on their existing loans, in a practice known as repricing.
Investors can refuse. But they typically don't when demand for loans is strong.
As with other types of riskier assets, from stocks to speculative-grade bonds, loans have been lifted in recent months by investors' growing confidence that the U.S. economy is on solid footing—thanks in part to improved U.S.-China trade relations and promises of support from Federal Reserve officials.
Though the coronavirus's spread has recently dented some of that confidence , demand for loans has remained sturdy enough that companies have continued to request lower rates from investors.
Especially with interest rates low around the world, "money is trying to find a place to generate returns," said Serhan Secmen, a portfolio manager at Napier Park Global Capital. "Not the Australian fires, not the coronavirus, not the potential Middle-East quagmire with Iran " have been enough to significantly slow markets this year.
The recent wave of repricings is particularly notable because loans underperformed other risky assets for much of last year. While stocks climbed to records, the extra yield, or spread, that investors were demanding to hold loans above their benchmark interest rates increased for all but the highest-rated loans.
Demand for loans last year was hurt in part by an uptick in financial stress among low-rated borrowers, caused by everything from opioid lawsuits to a decline in oil prices. A series of interest-rate cuts by the Fed also played a role, because loan coupons are pegged to underlying interest rates and individual investors typically flee from loan mutual-funds when rates are falling.
Increased interest in loans is a sign that some, if not all, of the challenges facing borrowers have stabilized. It also reflects the Fed's recent move to take a wait-and-see approach to reducing interest rates.
The lowest-rated loans have been the best performers in recent months. The average spread on triple-C rated loans in the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index has fallen to 11.9 percentage points above the London interbank offered rate from 13.9 percentage points in early November, while the spread on higher-rated double-B loans has slipped roughly 0.1 percentage point to 2.7 percentage points.
Some investors have been a little surprised by the volume of repricings given that the loan market remains weaker than it was during past refinancing booms.
Typically, repricings happen in large numbers when the percentage of loans trading at or above par is around 65% or higher, said Drew Sweeney, a loan trader and portfolio manager at TCW Group. Yet that number was a little below 50% in January, according to LCD.
Even so, many portfolio managers would rather accept a lower interest rate than have their loan repaid and be forced to either hold more cash or find a new loan.
"There's an avalanche of repricings, so you can't say no to all of them," Mr. Sweeney said.
Not all companies have won consent from investors to reprice their loans. Some lower-rated companies faced resistance in the last week of January when investors were particularly nervous about the coronavirus.
Software and analytics firm Change Healthcare Holdings Inc. failed to win support from investors to lower the interest rate on its $3.8 billion loan, which has a coupon of Libor plus 2.5 percentage points. The internet-services provider Web.com Group Inc. also couldn't reprice its $998 million loan, which has a coupon of Libor plus 3.75 percentage points.
Among the many successful companies, BJ's Wholesale Club was able to reduce the interest rate on its $1.3 billion loan to Libor plus 2.25 percentage points from Libor plus 3 percentage points, while Calpine cut the interest rate on its $980 million loan to Libor plus 2 percentage points from Libor plus 2.5 percentage points.
On average, companies that were able to execute repricings in January cut the interest rate on their loans by 0.55 percentage point to Libor plus 2.83 percentage points, according to LCD.

Global Stocks Edge Higher on New Stimulus Measures in China; Japanese stocks drop after data shows economic output shrank sharply in the fourth quarter

Global stocks edged higher Monday after Chinese authorities launched new stimulus measures to steady the economy and curtail the impact of the coronavirus outbreak .
Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 0.2%, on a day when U.S. stock markets were closed for Presidents Day. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index closed 0.3% higher. China's Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.3%, allowing the gauge to recover all its losses since the Lunar New Year holiday, when disruption caused by the epidemic led to a steep decline in equities.
The broad advance in global equities came after the People's Bank of China cut an interest rate in a move that could pave the way for benchmark borrowing rates to be reduced on Thursday. The central bank lowered the one-year medium-term lending facility rate to 3.15% from 3.25%, the latest step it has taken to bolster the Chinese economy during the viral outbreak.
The decision bolstered investors' confidence that Beijing is taking the necessary steps to prevent the coronavirus—which has sickened at least 71,812 people world-wide and killed more than 1,750—from leading to a significant slowdown in China's economy.
"The disruption we're currently experiencing should fade and the level of activity should come back to a normal level and even be stronger than in the first quarter," said Sophie Chardon, a strategist at Swiss private bank Lombard Odier.
Chinese authorities have been "very active on this front, especially on the monetary front, with the PBOC cutting rates twice," Ms. Chardon said. "They are actively managing the situation to mitigate the short-term effects of the virus."
Investors will get an early glimpse at how measures to contain the illness have rippled through the world economy later this week, when closely watched gauges of activity in the manufacturing and service sectors are published in the U.S., Europe and Japan.
Data showing that the coronavirus has dented economic activity world-wide will likely get "a bit of a free pass" from investors, according to Andrew Sheets, a strategist at Morgan Stanley. Fund managers don't expect the disruption to last long, he said.
Stock markets could come under pressure if economic growth doesn't show signs of recovery by April or May, when the Federal Reserve is expected to taper its purchases of short-term U.S. government debt securities, Mr. Sheets said. The central bank has said the program, launched in October to ease strain in money markets, will run "at least into the second quarter."
Among European stocks, auto-parts makers advanced after France's Faurecia proposed a higher dividend and predicted growth in sales this year. Its shares jumped 6.5% in Paris, while Italy's Pirelli and German car-part maker Continental also rose.
Jupiter Fund Management gained 3.7% after the London-based asset manager said it had agreed to buy Merian Global Investors for an initial £370 million ($483 million) in stock. If completed, the deal will create a group with more than £65 billion in assets under management.
Shares in Alstom rose 3.5% after The Wall Street Journal reported that the French company had reached a preliminary deal to buy the train business of Canada's Bombardier. Alstom has signed a memorandum of understanding to buy the unit for €5.8 billion to €6.2 billion ($6.28 billion to $6.72 billion), the rail company said after the close of trading.
In Japan, the Nikkei 225 stock index closed down 0.7% after fresh data showed a steep contraction in the nation's output in the final three months of 2019. Japan's economy—the world's third-largest—shrank at an annualized rate of 6.3%, largely because an increase in the national sales tax triggered a decline in private consumption.
In a sign that investors think Beijing will limit the economic damage caused by the coronavirus, copper prices continued their recent recovery, rising 1% to $5,813 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange. China accounts for around half of global demand for the industrial metal.

US evacuates travelers from quarantined ship in Japan

American passengers on Sunday frantically prepared to evacuate a cruise ship that has been quarantined for more than 10 days in the Japanese port city of Yokohama as hundreds of people on board fell ill with the coronavirus. 
As the Americans scrambled to pack their bags and prepare their own meals for a chartered flight to the United States, Japanese health officials said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases found on the ship, the Diamond Princess, had grown by 70, to 355.
"Can't get off here fast enough," Sarah Arana, 52, a medical social worker from Paso Robles, California, told reporters on Sunday.
The U.S. Embassy in Japan had recommended that American citizens stay aboard the ship during a 14-day quarantine period. But it suddenly changed course on Saturday, citing "a rapidly evolving situation" as conditions appeared to worsen.
American passengers said they were told to prepare to leave the ship at 9 p.m. local time. Their flight was scheduled to depart Haneda Airport in Tokyo at 3 a.m. Monday. Officials said they would be taken to one of two military air bases in the United States.
But the process, taken deck by deck, went slowly. By close to 11 p.m., many were still waiting in their rooms.
Passengers on the charter were told there would be no overhead luggage space on the flight, so all carry-ons had to fit under the seats in front of them, and shipped luggage could not exceed 70 pounds. They would be flying on a converted 747 cargo plane, the officials said, which could be cold, so they were advised to shower and dress warmly for the flight. They were also advised to bring their own food.
Late in the afternoon, as buses lined up on the pier, American officials dressed in protective suits knocked on the cabin doors of American citizens to inform them that they needed to put their luggage out at 6 p.m. to prepare for the 9 p.m. transfer.
Rachel Torres, 24, who had been on her honeymoon with her husband, Tyler, also 24, said they were trying to clean their stateroom so as not to leave a mess.
"We didn't sleep much last night," said Rachel Torres. In preparation for the flight, she said, the couple were "drinking as much water as we can to hydrate for the flight since we will be wearing masks on the plane."
Including the cases aboard the Diamond Princess, Japan has recorded the highest number of infections from the new coronavirus outside mainland China. Worldwide, more than 68,500 people have been infected, and at least 1,669 have died, almost all in mainland China.
When the ship was placed under quarantine, more than 3,700 passengers and crew were on board, including about 400 Americans.
The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said those with coronavirus infections or symptoms would not be allowed to take the chartered flight.
Once in the United States, the passengers will be required to undergo a two-week quarantine at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, California, or Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio.
Those who do not take the charter will not be allowed to travel to the United States until March 4, two weeks after they would have otherwise been allowed to leave the ship on Wednesday, the embassy said.
With at least 40 Americans from the ship having tested positive for the coronavirus during the quarantine period, some will be left behind in Japan when the charter flights depart.

Study abroad programs cut short by virus; Students across U.S. try to find alternative plans and secure visas

Last summer, Andie Yu arrived in Beijing for a yearlong program at Peking University. The UC Irvine computer science student from Las Vegas was eager to improve her Mandarin and gain experience to be a more competitive job candidate in China.
But her program was cut short after the University of California suspended all nonessential travel to China, including study abroad programs, in response to the fast-spreading coronavirus.
Now Yu, 23, an American citizen, is stuck in Xiamen, China, where she has relatives. She booked a flight to Los Angeles but is unsure when she'll make it home to her parents in Las Vegas -- and expects she'll be quarantined.
Yu is among hundreds of college students nationwide whose study plans have been upended by intensifying response to the virus. Students and university officials alike are scrambling to secure visas and flights back to the U.S., reenroll in coursework so as not to lose out on an entire semester, or find alternate study abroad programs, typically a highlight of students' college experience.
"Study abroad is, for most students, challenging to schedule into their degree advancement at all. So if it doesn't work in the planned semester, it's unlikely it's going to work in some other semester," said Caroline Maas, senior vice president for study global operations at the Council on International Educational Exchange. "For these individual students who have been planning to study abroad, in some cases for years, it's pretty tragic."
The blow to these academic exchanges between the U.S. and China is one of the myriad ways in which the virus, officially named COVID-19, has disrupted lives around the world. As of Sunday evening, there had been more than 71,300 confirmed cases and 1,775 deaths from the virus worldwide.
CIEE, which describes itself as the largest study abroad provider in the U.S., has canceled both its spring and summer offerings in China. The move affected students across the country, including several each at Occidental College, Syracuse University, the University of Colorado at Boulder and the University of Miami.
When the late January cancellations hit, most students' home institutions had already begun classes. Just a handful of CIEE programs, including "Berlin Business and Culture" and "Perth Arts and Sciences," remained open for enrollment. Students were given the option of switching to those programs for the same or lower cost or receiving a refund for their China studies.
But some students were advanced Chinese speakers seeking language immersion.
"An English-language program taught in Europe and focusing on business and communications and history clearly wasn't going to work," Maas said. So CIEE created new Chinese-intensive programs in Taiwan and London and moved many students there instead.
Yu was one of about 50 spring participants in China programs administered directly through UC. A native of Fujian province, she grew up primarily speaking a local dialect.
She immigrated to the U.S. after elementary school. Spending a year in Beijing, she hoped, would help her become fluent in Mandarin and teach her about Chinese society.
Yu was visiting relatives in Gutian when she got the news that her program was suspended.
"All my plans got messed up," she said.
At first, she asked to continue her studies since she was already in China. But, Yu said, she was told the program was suspended, in accordance with UC policy for countries under serious travel advisories.
With UC Irvine's winter quarter already well underway, returning to classes on campus wasn't an option. Yu was offered the chance to apply to Korea University but took too long to make up her mind, she said.
Even trying to collect her belongings and return to Las Vegas has been an ordeal. As she traveled last week from Gutian to Xiamen, she walked a quarter of a mile down a highway to cross a checkpoint, where officials took her temperature, she said.
She can't go back to Beijing to get her things from the Peking University dorm, so she's asked a teacher there to ship them to relatives.
Yu had to cancel a flight home, paying a $300 penalty, because passengers from China can no longer arrive directly in Las Vegas.
At USC, where study abroad in China is a part of many business students' education, officials have been "working like crazy" to respond to the effects of the coronavirus, said Tyrone Callahan, vice dean for undergraduate programs at the Marshall School of Business.
A popular leadership course for about 80 freshmen, for example, educates students on Chinese history and the economy and then sends them on a weeklong trip to Beijing and Shanghai over spring break.
"We spend a lot of time telling them how amazing it is to be able to go and see what's happening in China ... so when we had to pull back from that they were obviously disappointed," Callahan said.
Those students will instead split the week between Havana and Mexico City.
In New York, about 250 students from New York University's Shanghai campus were relocated to its flagship in Manhattan. About 80 moved to other NYU sites around the world, while some 600 more -- mostly Chinese nationals who didn't have or couldn't quickly get a visa to study elsewhere -- remain in China, where they may continue the semester through distance learning online, said NYU Associate Vice Chancellor Josh Taylor.
Alexandra Kogler of Atherton, Calif., and Brandon Shi of Chino Hills began their freshman year at NYU Shanghai last fall. The two 19-year-old students are now enrolled on campus in New York.
"It feels overwhelming to adjust to a new campus right away. It's a huge change in terms of the city and the student body size," said Kogler, who has yet to declare a major.
She said her new professors have given her time to catch up with coursework.
Shi, an interactive media arts and business major, is worried about his expenses. Although the university didn't charge him more for housing in New York, he expects to pay a lot more for food.
But mostly he's excited.
"I think this was honestly the best solution to a tragic incident," he said.

Toys to Teslas: Virus blocks flow; Businesses that rely on China for production, tourism and consumer spending feel the pain from deadly outbreak.

Like many other American staples and luxuries, L.O.L. Surprise! dolls are made in China. Chatsworth-based MGA Entertainment has them manufactured in Guangdong province, trucked to the port in Yantian Harbor, loaded on ships and brought to the United States, where the popular toys are distributed to retailers and scooped up by eager children. The process went smoothly for years.
Then the coronavirus outbreak hit, and the supply chain stuttered.
The situation is "a disaster, frankly," MGA Chief Executive Isaac Larian said. Production of his company's toys has dropped 60% compared with this period last year. To get by, he said, he is filling only partial toy orders -- "if a retailer wants 100,000 pieces, we're giving them 15,000 or 20,000."
Businesses of all stripes in California and nationwide are feeling pain from the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed 1,775 people and infected more than 71,300 others worldwide, mostly in China.
Activity at Chinese factories has slowed or stopped. Fewer cargo ships from China are docking at Southern California ports. Chinese visitors' spending in Los Angeles could plunge nearly $1 billion this year.
U.S. shoppers might start seeing items missing from store shelves as early as mid-April, analyst Edward J. Kelly of Wells Fargo Securities said in a note to clients last week. Big-box retailers such as Walmart and Target "could be the first to experience out-of-stock issues" because they restock more quickly, he wrote.
Should the epidemic be quickly contained, the overall effect on California's economy will be short-term with minimal job losses, said Lynn Reaser, chief economist of the Fermanian Business &Economic Institute at Point Loma Nazarene University.
"Most of the damage will be toward the bottom lines of these companies," Reaser said. "There's therefore no need to implement long-term layoffs of the types of employees involved in California."
Still, she said California's technology firms will probably see a drop in sales and profits, especially those dependent on parts coming from China and those reliant on the sale of goods and services to China.
Larian, however, fears the virus could "cause a major downturn on the whole consumer-goods business -- electronics, shoes, apparel."
The timing of the outbreak was key because workers at Chinese plants had returned to their hometowns for two weeks to celebrate the Lunar New Year on Jan. 25, and "now they're stuck, they cannot come back to the factories" because of quarantines, Larian said.
"Some of the factories that did open can't get raw materials, like fabric and plastics, to make the products. And if they can make products, they can't get them on the road to the ships because the quarantines mean you can't travel from one area to another," he said.
Rival toymaker Mattel Inc. in El Segundo also cited that problem Friday in announcing that its Chinese factories and those of its contract partners, which were supposed to restart production Feb. 3, would stay shut until Monday.
"We do expect production delays," Mattel Chief Financial Officer Joseph Euteneuer said on a call with analysts. "While none of our manufacturing is located in the Wuhan province" where the coronavirus outbreak started, "the ability of the manufacturing workforce to return to work after the Lunar New Year holiday is being impacted."
One of those workers is Li Jianchao, who works in a factory that makes stuffed animals and dolls in the southern Chinese city of Dongguan but traveled to the Jiangxi province in central China, 500 miles away, for the holiday. For the last few weeks, he's had no luck contacting his boss about returning to work.
"At first, he said he would get back to us when he knew he could resume the operation," Li said. "Then he stopped taking anyone's phone calls."
It's a problem felt across industries. Apple Inc.'s manufacturing partners, such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., also known as Foxconn, imposed quarantines on workers returning from the holiday this month, causing a halt in device assembly operations.
"We see that the number [of virus cases] don't seem to be ebbing," said Gerrit Schneemann, senior smartphone analyst at the research firm IHS Markit. "It feels like this will continue on at least for a couple more weeks."
The delays "will be a shock to the system and disrupt the supply chain further for Apple on both its core iPhone franchise and AirPods unit production, which is already facing a short supply," analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said in a recent note.
China makes 80% of the world's smartphones and tablets and it exports 55% of the world's handsets and computers, according to research from the Swiss bank UBS.
Earlier this month Facebook Inc. stopped taking new orders for its back-ordered Oculus Quest virtual reality headset due to delays in hardware production from the viral outbreak.
Amazon.com urged Chinese third-party sellers on its Marketplace section to alert buyers of the likely disruption of orders and to consider setting their status to vacation mode to avoid incurring poor customer ratings, according to messages to sellers viewed by The Times.
Qualcomm Inc., the San Diego-based chip manufacturing giant, warned shareholders on an earnings call that the virus had introduced "significant uncertainty" into the company's overseas supply chain, with Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf calling the outbreak an "unprecedented situation."
Chui Yin Chau, a virtual and augmented reality industry analyst with Greenlight Insights, said there was no clear end in sight to the turmoil.
"When we talk to manufacturers, they cannot give an estimate" of when they might be able to return to full production capacity, Chau said. "Most of them are starting to resume production this week, but it still depends on many, many external factors, so they cannot guarantee anything."
The effect on supply chains extends to the Port of Los Angeles -- along with the dockworkers, truck drivers and the vast warehouse and distribution network that rely on it -- all of which already had been disrupted in recent months by the U.S.-China trade war, said Gene Seroka, the port's executive director.
He estimated that overall, there would be 80 fewer sailings of ships from China to the United States, and 350,000 fewer shipping containers received, in the coming weeks. The number of cargo containers received at the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach would drop by one-fifth.
The virus also means fewer Chinese people are visiting Southern California. Tourism Economics, a division of Oxford Economics, forecasts a loss of up to 325,000 Chinese visitors to Los Angeles this year owing to the outbreak, resulting in a drop of $921 million in direct spending. But overall visitor spending in L.A. is still expected to rise.
More than 100,000 people were scheduled to converge on Barcelona, Spain, next week for the world's largest phone show, Mobile World Congress, but that event was canceled Wednesday due to the virus.
David Schwartz, a gaming historian and history professor at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on Las Vegas is still unclear and that a better read will come in March when detailed data on gambling spending for January and February will be released. He said spending on Baccarat, a card game favored by Chinese gamblers, will be telling.
"The question is if it spreads, does it lead to a shift in travel behavior," he said. "If it is contained and goes away pretty quickly, it's not going to be a big impact."
Some of Las Vegas' biggest casino owners, such as Wynn Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts International, may suffer the biggest blows because they also own resorts in Macao, an autonomous region of China where casinos have been shuttered.
Americans, meanwhile, are cutting back on travel for fear of infection. Travel Leaders Network, a group of 5,700 travel agencies in North America, said it surveyed nearly 400 travel advisors and found that about one-third reported a high to moderate number of cancellations to China and other parts of Asia.
Anoosheh Oskouian, chief executive of Ship &Shore, a Signal Hill provider of pollution-abatement equipment, said she won't travel to China to check on operations at a manufacturing facility for fear of getting the virus. The firm became a co-owner of a plant in China late last year to offset the costs of higher tariffs on products it imports.
"This is the first time we are manufacturing everything there and I'm not able to go back," Oskouian said. "I'm supposed to be in China right now. We're almost completely out of touch with the people we should be in regular contact with. It's one of those problems where it's hard to develop a solution."
A broad swath of U.S. firms that sell goods and services in China is also losing sales due to the virus.
McDonald's Corp., Nike Inc. and Starbucks Corp. already have closed scores of stores in China. The apparel firm Under Armour Inc. said the outbreak would cause its sales to drop by $50 million to $60 million.
Skechers USA Inc., the Manhattan Beach-based footwear maker, also reported "a significant number of temporary store closures" and said its comparable store sales in China -- or those of stores open at least a year -- were "below average."
Walt Disney Co. has temporarily shut down its theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong, which is expected to cut $175 million from its second-quarter operating income.
The coronavirus also has effectively shut down mainland China's booming cinema industry, with almost all theaters in the country closed, and Chinese and U.S. studios have felt the effects of the pause.
During the Spring Festival holiday, which ran Jan. 24 through Feb. 12, box-office sales totaled about $3.94 million, down nearly 100% from $1.5 billion the same holiday period a year ago, according to Artisan Gateway, a consultancy that follows the Chinese film industry.
For studios outside China, including Hollywood companies that often rely on the country's massive population to pad results for their movies, the market has virtually vanished temporarily due to the outbreak. Imported films have grossed a mere $37.8 million at Chinese theaters so far this year, down 86% from the same period in 2019, according to Artisan Gateway data.
Tesla Inc., meanwhile, shut down its new Shanghai assembly plant from Feb. 2 to Feb. 10, but it's unclear how much production has resumed. The Fremont automaker was aiming to build 150,000 electric cars at the facility this year.
"It is unknown whether and how global supply chains, particularly for automotive parts, may be affected if such an epidemic persists for an extended period of time," Tesla said in its newly issued 2019 annual report.
Overall, the virus will disrupt production of at least 1 million vehicles across the industry, the China Assn. of Automobile Manufacturers said.
Even if the outbreak stabilized today, "it's probably three weeks before you get real visibility" on its effect on the carmakers "and everyone has their own plans to either throttle down or ramp up capacity," said Dan Hearsch, a managing director at the consulting firm AlixPartners.
Earlier this month, European commercial aircraft maker Airbus temporarily closed a final assembly line for its A-320 aircraft in Tianjin, China, but the company said Thursday it had been authorized by Chinese authorities to reopen the line. Airbus did not specify when it would restart or how the closure affected its business.
"Airbus is constantly evaluating the situation and monitoring any potential secondary effects to production and deliveries and will try to mitigate via alternative plans where necessary," Airbus said.
Due to tight government regulations, the U.S. aerospace industry does not typically import components from China, though materials from China can be made into parts elsewhere in the world and eventually used in U.S. planes and other vehicles.

Rockville congregation hopes to ease fears with prayer, updates on virus 
On Sunday, the Mandarin-speaking congregation at the Chinese Bible Church of Maryland started the service, as they have for weeks, with a several-part prayer for those affected by the coronavirus. 
In a white-walled sanctuary, they prayed for the sick, and for the doctors and nurses treating them. They prayed for the government leaders working to contain the epidemic, which has infected 69,000 people and killed more than 1,600, nearly all in China. They prayed for congregants whose relatives have been infected, and finally, they prayed for themselves. 
'For people with their hearts filled with fear, give them faith,' said elder John Lei, 58, from the pulpit. In a yellow booklet distributed to attendees, church leaders made their plea more explicit: 'Pray that the false information spreading via social media will stop and not be trusted, and that the spread of unwarranted fear, anxiety, panic, and prejudices outside China will stop.' 
The Chinese Bible Church is located in Rockville, which has the highest population of Asians in Maryland, including several thousand born in China. With about 1,000 congregants, the church is among many in Chinese communities in the United States that have felt strong ripple effects from fears about coronavirus. 
Of the six congregations at the church, the two Mandarin-speaking ones have been most affected, said senior pastor Hugo Cheng. In recent weeks, there has been a noticeable drop in attendance at Mandarin services, from about 280 attendees at Sunday worship to about 200, he said. Some members have canceled events or meetings, and a handful have called to withdraw participation in church activities 'indefinitely,' Cheng said. 
Other churches have seen even greater fallout: At the Grace Chinese Baptist Church in Richmond, attendance is down 50-percent, said pastor Carter Tan. 
Part of this decrease is expected, Tan said. Many Chinese in the United States have recently visited China for the Lunar New Year, and church leaders have advised those who just returned to avoid services for two weeks as a 'courtesy' to other attendees. There are also, however, some congregants who have not left the United States in months but are nonetheless fearful of visiting the church.
'People are trying to take extra precautions and not show up, which I can understand,' Tan said. 'They ask themselves, 'Where should I avoid going?' The Asian grocery store is on that list, the Chinese church is on the list.'
Cheng, the Rockville pastor, said that a majority of congregants have been levelheaded about the crisis but that a small group of 'alarmists' have found it difficult to differentiate between Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, and the United States, where only 15 cases of the infection have been confirmed " none in the Washington area. 
'Even though they're in the U.S., their mind-set is as though they are in China,' Cheng said.
At the same time, there are several congregants from Wuhan who still have family there. Last week, two congregants reported that their parents had died of the virus; because the city is still in lockdown, neither of them have been able to return. 
'In this way, it's not far from here at all,' said Lei.
According to public health experts, the coronavirus is the first epidemic that has fully unfolded in the age of social media. Facebook, Instagram, and the popular Chinese apps WeChat and Weibo have allowed users across the world to tune into constant, live updates on the spread of the virus. It has amplified feelings of anxiety, says the Massachusetts Technology Review, and fueled the spread of misinformation.
Working with large tech firms, the World Health Organization has launched a global campaign to fight this 'infodemic.' At local churches, pastors are taking things into their own hands. 
In Richmond, Tan has sent out emails urging congregants to resume regular church activities. In Rockville, church leaders have assembled a 'medical advisory task force' to sift through information from national and international bodies, and provide accurate updates on the virus to the community. A congregant who is also an epidemiologist at the National Institutes of Health has given two informational sessions. And two weeks ago, Chang gave a sermon in Mandarin, calling on members to not 'let their fear control their actions.' 
'His message was not to fear in blindness,' Lei remembered. 'We're here, we're singing songs without a mask because we know who's in control.'
At Sunday morning's Mandarin service, attendance was up, Chang observed. There were still pockets of empty seats in the sanctuary, but some longtime members had returned: a couple who had just finished their period of self-quarantine after visiting Taiwan, one of the elders who had gone to China for business, and an usher who had flown home to see his mother. 
Standing in front of a blue-stained window, Chang held up the paper booklet with church news for the coming week. 'Look at the activities we have,' he said in Mandarin, smiling. 'I know some churches have canceled events, but not us.' 
'I'm grateful,' he continued, 'that we're not intimidated by fear.'

As virus spreads, some
in White House push for
a harder line with China
President Trump has lavished praise on Chinese President Xi Jinping for his handling of the growing coronavirus outbreak " a posture some in his administration are growing increasingly uncomfortable with as his advisers remain concerned about China's lack of transparency and handling of the epidemic.
Worries about rattled financial markets and their effect on the economy as well as the delicate negotiations with China over a trade deal " a key to Trump's reelection " have played a large role in influencing the president's friendly posture toward China over the deadly coronavirus, according to several senior White House and administration officials. Trump has heralded Xi's leadership and 'discipline' in responding to the outbreak.
'I had a long talk with President Xi " for the people in this room " two nights ago, and he feels very confident. He feels very confident. And he feels that, again, as I mentioned, by April or during the month of April, the heat, generally speaking, kills this kind of virus,' Trump told the nation's governors last week. 'So that would be a good thing. But we're in great shape in our country.'
U.S. and international health experts have for weeks expressed concerns that China has not been fully transparent about the breadth of the outbreak and that it cracked down on doctors who tried to sound the alarm in December. U.S. officials still do not have the information they have repeatedly asked for from China, which some have argued warrants a tougher line from the United States.
Trump has repeatedly told advisers that pushing for a harder line against China could backfire because Xi controls the government 'totally' and will not work with the United States if it says anything negative about the country, said one of these senior administration officials, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private talks.
So far, the United States has 15 confirmed cases, though officials have warned that they expect to see more. On Sunday, Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told The Washington Post that 44 Americans who were traveling on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have been infected.
Trump has remained uncharacteristically restrained in his public comments about the coronavirus, which has infected more than 70,000 people, the vast majority of whom are in China. Trump's praise toward Xi has irked some advisers, who say the compliments are unwarranted as the United States is still working to get a team of experts access to data and Chinese sites to study the virus, aid in the response and secure all the needed information.
The United States has been working closely with the World Health Organization and engaged in other diplomatic efforts to get its experts into China. Several U.S. experts are now in Beijing, three senior administration officials said, but officials are still working to ensure that those experts get access to the data and sites they need. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still does not have the information it wants, administration officials said. 
Although the United States has so far effectively contained the virus, some senior administration officials said there have been tensions within the administration over what information the president should receive, his posture toward China and what message to send to the American public. And several officials said there has been too much focus on evacuating Americans overseas " and too little on what to do if the epidemic spreads within the United States, given the continued growth of the virus.
Trump named a coronavirus task force last month that is led by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and composed of top officials from the CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House. It came after a Jan.-27 meeting in acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's office, where some officials argued that the administration was not taking the threat seriously enough.
For weeks, the administration's message was that the threat to the American public remained low and the virus was not spreading within communities " but it warned that could change. Some advisers recently pushed for a more balanced message because they now expect there to be wider spread as more cases have been reported in countries outside China, according to three officials, and the administration has since adjusted its message to reflect that.
When it became clear late last month that the outbreak was far more serious and widespread than previously known, several major international and U.S. air carriers suspended flights to China for weeks. China has also halted work at several factories across the country as it tries to contain the virus, affecting some international companies' ability to conduct business, including Hyundai. 
The United States subsequently escalated its response, barring most non-U.S. citizens who recently visited China from traveling to the United States and mandating federal quarantines for Americans who had visited China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, within the past 14 days. 
The markets fell as the outbreak grew. On Jan.-31, the same day several airlines suspended flights and the United States announced its escalated response, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 600-points, or 2-percent. Trump grew concerned that any stronger action by his administration would hurt the economy, and he has told advisers that he does not want the administration to do or say anything that would further spook the markets. He remains worried that any large-scale outbreak could hurt his reelection bid. 
Four senior administration officials, including Fauci, a member of the task force, insisted that U.S. actions have been driven entirely by public health considerations and a desire to contain the virus.
'President Trump's top priority is the health and welfare of the American people,' White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. 'The president has received regular updates, including from experts within the federal government on infectious diseases.'
HHS officials have told Trump that infections could decrease in the spring when it gets warmer because most coronaviruses and upper respiratory infections " including the flu " level off as the weather warms. 
The coronavirus spreading through China and in about two dozen other countries, however, has never been seen before, and little is known about how it behaves or whether it will eventually mutate. The idea that it will taper off in the spring is 'mainly an educated guess,' according to one senior White House official. In Singapore, for instance, it is above 80-degrees and humid, but there are still more than 50-cases of the virus. CDC officials are now warning the president and others in the administration that cases could increase, administration officials said. 
'In fairness to the president, someone told him something that has a basis in reality. . . . There is some validity in saying respiratory viruses like flu and coronavirus are seasonal,' Fauci said. 'The only thing is, when you're dealing with a pandemic-type virus that is brand new, there's no way of knowing what's going to happen when the weather gets warm.' 
Some of Trump's advisers have contradicted his friendly posture toward China in public. Larry Kudlow, the National Economic Council director, said the United States was 'disappointed' in China's response and called on Beijing to be more transparent. Other officials, including Joseph Grogan, head of the Domestic Policy Council, have said China cannot be trusted. Peter Navarro, one of the president's top trade advisers, has repeatedly pushed for a stronger tone. 
Some officials have complained that Trump's comments about the virus emanate from his briefings with Azar, who they say has been overly controlling in the response and has told other doctors not to get too far into the details of the virus and the outbreak with Trump. Azar is disliked by many in the White House, four administration officials said.
Fauci, however, said Azar has brought medical professionals with him to nearly every briefing and insisted they be part of Oval Office meetings. 
Azar 'always defers to the scientists. That's the reason why whenever we're in the Situation Room and the president would like some briefing, Alex always takes me and (CDC Director) Bob Redfield in with him,' Fauci said. 'He always wants us to give the straight scientific information to the president.' 
Azar has also wanted to be the one to announce major updates about the administration's response to the virus, several officials said. 
On Thursday, he briefed the Senate Finance Committee that the CDC would use public health labs in five cities that normally test for influenza to also test for the coronavirus, taking state health officials by surprise. One senior administration official said it was part of an effort to execute 'radical transparency' with Congress and the public, noting that officials are doing their best to communicate clearly and effectively in a fast-moving situation. 
It was not the first time state officials have been caught off guard by the administration's actions. After the White House announced late last month that it would quarantine travelers who had been in the hard-hit Hubei province within the past 14-days, federal and state officials were struggling with how to carry out the travel restrictions and where to quarantine passengers because they said the order came with no advance notice and little planning.
Two administration officials said the White House was also struggling with the logistics, including last-minute planning for when planes landed with patients and potential patients. 'Doing the best we can,' one official involved in the response said. 
Some officials said the response has become smoother and better coordinated in recent weeks, with daily task-force calls.
'Our public health system's the best in the world, and it's working,' Azar said Friday. 'That system is what identified the 15-cases that we have.'

Japan's Economy Shrinks 6.3% as Sales-Tax Increase Cools Consumption; In Germany, central bank said it sees no sign of improvement in the first-quarter growth outlook

TOKYO—Following a dismal final quarter of 2019, Japan's economy is facing the risk of a recession because the coronavirus outbreak is hurting tourism and production, while Germany's central bank called on the government in Berlin to use its surplus to support growth as a broader danger of a slowdown builds.
Japan, the world's third-largest economy after the U.S. and China contracted at an annualized rate of 6.3% in the October-December quarter, worse than economists' forecast of a 3.9% contraction. The biggest reason was a sharp drop in private consumption after the national sales tax rose to 10% on Oct. 1 from 8%.
"Because of the effects of the novel coronavirus , weakness in consumption will likely continue in the January-March period. Exports and production could be dreadfully weak as the supply chain is interrupted," said Daiwa Securities economist Mari Iwashita.
Some economists, including Ms. Iwashita, say Japan could fall into a technical recession—two straight quarters of contraction—this quarter. The contraction in the October-December quarter was the first in more than a year and the biggest since the April-June quarter in 2014, the last time the sales tax was raised.
Germany's central bank warned Monday that it sees no sign of improvement in the growth outlook in the first quarter of 2020. Germany's economy, Europe's largest, has stagnated for almost two years as international trade tensions weighed on its large manufacturing sector. The coronavirus outbreak in China is an additional threat.
The Bundesbank said a temporary decline in China's economy is likely to damp German exports. "In addition, some global value chains could be affected by the security measures taken. Delivery bottlenecks in individual industries in Germany would be the result," it said.
The Bundesbank called on the government to spend its large surplus to provide a boost, a shift for an economically conservative institution that had until recently pushed back against international demands that Germany loosen its purse strings.
"There is clearly room for maneuver within the framework of the government budget rules," the Bundesbank wrote in its monthly report. "This could be used to improve the conditions for growth and employment."
Singapore said Monday it was downgrading its growth forecast for 2020 to a 0.5% contraction to 1.5% growth because of the coronavirus outbreak, which has led to a sharp decline in tourist arrivals. In November, before the outbreak, the city-state's government had projected growth of 0.5% to 2.5%. Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry said China's slowdown would have an impact across Southeast Asia due to supply-chain disruptions and reduced Chinese import demand.
Malaysian officials said Friday that the government would announce a stimulus package later this month to assist businesses. "Emphasis should also be placed on exploring alternative revenues such as shifting towards encouraging domestic tourism, and sourcing from other markets," Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said.
In Japan, the virus has hit Chinese tourism in Japan and disrupted some manufacturing in the country that depends on Chinese parts.
Sales at Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd.'s three flagship department stores in Tokyo fell about 20% during the Lunar New Year holiday between Jan. 24 and Jan. 30 compared with the previous year. The holiday has been a popular time for Chinese tourists to travel abroad.
"Sales were doing well in the first half of the holidays but declined in the last half after the Chinese government implemented a ban on group tours" on Jan. 27, said an Isetan Mitsukoshi spokeswoman. Cosmetics, jewelry and handbags were among the items feeling the impact, she said.
Chinese accounted for about 37% of the $44 billion in spending by tourists in Japan last year.
The International Civil Aviation Organization estimates that Japan could lose $1.29 billion in tourism revenue in the first quarter because of fewer Chinese air travelers. In central Japan's Shizuoka prefecture, home to hot-spring resorts and a portion of Mount Fuji, more than 90,000 tourists, mainly Chinese, canceled their hotel reservations through March, according to the Shizuoka Prefectural Tourism Association.
Another negative note for the tourism industry comes from the virus outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is docked in Yokohama and quarantined until at least Wednesday. As of Sunday, 355 passengers and crew on the ship tested positive for the virus, according to Japan's Health Ministry.
"The two key points are when flights in and out of China will resume and whether or not global tourists are feeling anxious about coming to Japan after the virus spread on the cruise ship," said Katsuhiro Hashimoto, an official at the Shizuoka association.
Daiwa's Ms. Iwashita expects the economy to shrink an annualized 0.5% in the first quarter, but the figure could worsen if a production slowdown in China hits Japanese factories more widely.
Nissan Motor Co. reduced production at a factory in southern Japan on Friday and Monday owing to a shortage of auto parts shipped from China, a spokeswoman said. That factory will take another day off Feb. 24. Two other domestic locations took the day off Saturday.
Some economists are calling for government spending of tens of billions of dollars to make up the losses.
"The Japanese government needs to state its intention to clearly shift toward fiscal expansion and prepare further economic measures by issuing a large amount of new government bonds," said Takuji Aida, a Societe General economist in Tokyo. "If the economy falls back again into a huge recession and fails to get out of deflation, any more sales tax increase would be almost impossible."

There is now a price tag on the tweet that ravaged the NBA's business in China: hundreds of millions of dollars.
Houston Rockets general manager's Daryl Morey tweet in October supporting the protesters in Hong Kong enraged the Beijing government and resulted in an extraordinary standoff between the world's most populous country and its most popular American sports league. Chinese sponsors cut ties with the Rockets, who haven't appeared on the country's top streaming platform this season, and NBA games still haven't returned to the airwaves of state television.
It has been four months since the league's reckoning, which has been overshadowed by China's attempts to contain an outbreak of the novel coronavirus that has killed thousands of people, but the financial consequences for the NBA have only recently begun to come into focus.
The loss "will be in the hundreds of millions," NBA commissioner Adam Silver said on Saturday, the first time he'd used such a number to estimate the cost to the league's China business. The hit amounted to "probably less than $400 million," Silver said in response to speculation that the losses could reach $1 billion, though he cautioned that the final number might be lower than the figure he cited.
"It's substantial," Silver said. "I don't want to run from that. We were taken off the air in China for a period of time, and it caused our many business partners in China to feel it was therefore inappropriate to have ongoing relationships with us. But I don't have any sense that there's any permanent damage to our business there."
Morey's tweet, China's backlash, the U.S. political establishment's uproar, the NBA's initially conciliatory response and its defiant refusal to buckle under Beijing's pressure were the roots of the greatest crisis the league had encountered in years.
It plunged the NBA into an unexpected battle that pitted its commitment to protecting free speech against the pursuit of riches in a lucrative market, and it played out with the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets on Chinese soil for two exhibition games while Beijing and Washington were engaged in a heated trade negotiation on the heels of the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule.
After the players, teams and league executives returned to the U.S., Silver stressed that the league was committed to a future in China, describing calls for the NBA to disengage as "cartoonish characterizations of business." NBA officials were confident that if they took a diplomatic approach to the standoff, then cooler heads would prevail over time, but they couldn't be sure when.
It hasn't happened yet.
The streaming giant Tencent is showing a reduced number of games from last season, and Chinese state-run television still hasn't broadcast the NBA this season. Tencent is airing the events of All-Star weekend, however, and NBA officials had been quietly optimistic that CCTV's sports channel would bring the NBA back with the All-Star Game on Sunday, which happened to be after the Lunar New Year and the beginning of a new trade deal between Washington and Beijing.
But then the coronavirus hit China. The remarkable pressure on China to contain the virus makes the Communist Party's strategy for dealing with the NBA seem trivial by comparison. Even with millions of people living under quarantine who could be watching basketball at home, the NBA returning to CCTV is not a priority for a government under fire.
"It's almost hard for us to be having conversations about the broadcasting of games when there is a major national, if not global, health crisis happening," Silver said.
Silver said he's not pressing the issue at a time when everyday life in China is at a standstill because of the virus. When the NBA might be on television again is beyond the league's control, Silver said, and he was not sure which official in China's authoritarian government would have the power to make such a decision.
Silver opened his customary news conference on the Saturday of All-Star weekend by addressing the recent deaths of Kobe Bryant and David Stern—and, in a sign of how much the NBA values its largest foreign market, speaking to the people of China.
"We wish you all the best in dealing with these tragic circumstances and encourage you to stay strong and hope you can find some solace through sports and the things we're doing at the NBA," Silver said.
There had been indications the league was taking steps to brace for significant losses even before Saturday's disclosure.
Last month, the NBA informed teams to expect a $1 million drop in the projected salary cap for next season, according to a person familiar with the matter. The salary cap determines how much the league's 30 teams are permitted to spend on players, and it's based on approximately half of the NBA's annual revenues. The guidance came after the league downgraded its projections last September, before the unexpected showdown with China, from $118 million to $116 million. The latest decrease was down to $115 million—which appeared to signal the league was planning for losses in the $60 million range.
It still represents an increase from this year's salary cap of $109 million, and the league owes much of its financial boom over the last decade to a new domestic television contract in 2014 that nearly tripled its rights fees. But the NBA has long viewed China as its most important foreign market and the engine powering its future growth, and the league signed a five-year contract extension worth $1.5 billion last summer with Tencent, which has refused to show Rockets games since the team was effectively blacklisted in October.
But it was encouraging to the league when Yao Ming, the former Rockets star who is now the head of the Chinese Basketball Association, made the trip to New York recently for Stern's memorial service, where the 7-foot-6 man had a reserved seat in the front row of Radio City Music Hall. Yao, who refused to take the NBA's calls during the China standoff, was one of the few players who received a special mention in Silver's eulogy.

Congo's Ebola outbreak finally wanes

The second-biggest Ebola outbreak in history, which has upended life in eastern Congo's North Kivu and Ituri provinces since August 2018, infecting nearly 3,500 people and killing about 2,250, is down to its last chain of transmission.
Despite ongoing violence that has hampered the response from its outset, and that has spiked again recently, new cases have dwindled. At its height last May, hundreds were contracting the disease every week.
The waning of the Ebola outbreak comes as a new one captures global attention " and, potentially, funding as well. Global health officials have warned that while the novel coronavirus, now known as covid-19, racks up thousands of new cases a day, the hard work of ending the Ebola outbreak and preventing another is far from over.
'Funding needs [for the Ebola response] have not as yet been fully met, and currently there is a risk there will not be funding for WHO activities beyond February,' said Margaret Harris, a World Health Organization spokeswoman.
On Wednesday, an independent committee that advises the WHO unanimously agreed the Ebola outbreak 'still constitutes a public health emergency of international concern' " a designation that was recently extended to the covid-19 outbreak.
Ebola and covid-19 are vastly different viruses: Ebola can be transmitted only through exchange of bodily fluids, but it killed nearly 70 percent of those who contracted it in eastern Congo.
The WHO's director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said Thursday that covid-19 'might have adverse consequences for the [Ebola] response efforts through diminishing focus' on it.
While the WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a constellation of nonprofits and the Congolese Health Ministry have mounted a relentless campaign to contain Ebola, little has been done to shore up the region's health system, which is sorely lacking in even the most basic infrastructure. Ebola is endemic to Congo's rainforest, and the likelihood of future outbreaks is high.
'Only half of health facilities have access to water,' Tedros said. 'Strengthening a health system may not be as sexy as responding to an outbreak, but it is equally important.'
Almost all of this month's cases have been reported in the restive city of Beni, which has also been besieged by an Islamist militia that calls itself the Allied Democratic Forces, or ADF.
In late October, the Congolese military launched an offensive against the ADF, complicating the Ebola response and sparking a wave of retaliatory attacks that have killed hundreds of civilians. The offensive has been lauded by Congo's president, Félix Tshisekedi, as nearly flushing the group out of Beni and the surrounding region, but a resurgence of ADF attacks in February has cast doubt on those claims.
Harris, the WHO spokeswoman, said that while officials were confident in asserting only one chain of Ebola transmission remains, ongoing violence has made it impossible to reach some areas that have had cases over the past few months.
'Given the lack of access in some areas like Lwemba, it's possible that there are other areas where there could be cases that we are not aware of, but it's unlikely,' she said.
With the end of the outbreak in sight, some of the response's protocols have shifted as resources have been freed up from emergency activities. Now, patients can be afforded a greater degree of comfort, instead of being confined to Ebola treatment centers where the dead and dying were present.
'Everyone who has been in contact with someone confirmed to have Ebola is now offered the option of voluntary isolation " meaning that if they would like, they can be accommodated in a guesthouse where they are provided with food and health support " so that they can be monitored as closely as possible, and if they develop symptoms they can be brought to care as quickly as possible,' Harris said. 'Most people are taking up this offer.'
In addition to a shortfall of investments in eastern Congo's health infrastructure, a large funding gap exists for an ongoing measles outbreak in the same region that has killed 6,300 people in far less time than Ebola.
Peace is also unlikely to return soon to the region, known as the Great Lakes for its defining geographical feature, as competition over minerals heats up between the Congolese, Ugandan, Rwandan and Burundian governments and local militias aligned with them.
'The Great Lakes region is increasingly on edge. Distrust is rife among Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda, all of which have connections to insurgents in eastern Congo,' said a recent report by the International Crisis Group. Plans by Congo's Tshisekedi to invite armies from those countries to help defeat the ADF and other groups heighten the chances for an intensification of conflict.
'Were Burundian, Rwandan and Ugandan forces given a green light' to operate in Congo, the report said, 'the danger would be all the graver, raising the specter of an interlocking proxy war wherein each Great Lakes country is backing its rivals' enemies.'

TRAVELERS FACE
MORE QUARANTINE
American from 2nd vesselhas virus, Malaysia says
YOKOHAMA, Japan " U.S. officials on Saturday set in motion plans to evacuate Americans under lockdown aboard the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in the Japanese port of Yokohama. But some passengers greeted the news with outrage after learning that they will face a 14-day quarantine upon their return to the United States.
Meanwhile, an 83-year-old American woman aboard another cruise ship, which docked in Cambodia on Friday after being refused by five other ports, tested positive for coronavirus. Cambodia had cleared her and others on the ship to travel, but she was tested again in Malaysia after flying there and showing symptoms, according to Malaysian health officials.
Details about the woman's case remained unclear. But it could force health officials in the United States and other countries to reevaluate whether to put additional checks on MS Westerdam passengers, who are heading home.
In China, the epicenter of the outbreak, a team of experts from the World Health Organization is expected to arrive Sunday, following prolonged negotiations with the country's government. They will travel to Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected in December, and other affected cities to see the efforts underway to contain the virus and treat patients, China's National Health Commission said Saturday. 
The team from the Geneva-based WHO will encounter a nation under even more draconian quarantine rules to halt the virus's spread as the number of cases nationwide surpasses 68,500 and the death total reaches approximately 1,666. Meanwhile, France announced that a patient had died of the illness, marking the first death outside Asia.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Saturday that 'it's impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take' and expressed concern about 'the lack of urgency in funding the response from the international community.'
Chinese President Xi Jingping, under pressure to show that he has been proactive in addressing the virus, on Saturday released a Feb.-3 speech that he gave to the Communist Party's most powerful body acknowledging that he had asked top party officials to respond to the outbreak almost two weeks before the nation's officials spoke publicly about the virus, according to local news reports.
Not far from Tokyo, Americans on the Diamond Princess reacted with both relief and anger to the news Saturday that they may soon disembark. The two-week quarantine that they will face on U.S. soil is consistent with the isolation of Americans evacuated from Wuhan, as the virus has a maximum incubation period of 14-days.
The Diamond Princess passengers will be housed at Travis Air Force Base in California or Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas and kept separate from the previous evacuees, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All passengers will be screened before leaving the ship and constantly monitored and evaluated along the way, the CDC said.
The government-chartered flights, set to depart Sunday, will be passengers' only chance to return to the United States until at least March-4, the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo told passengers in a letter. The date is 14-days after the rest of the Diamond Princess's passengers expect to disembark Wednesday.
Passengers who take the U.S. government-chartered flights will not have to pay for their return to the first stop in the United States, but they will be responsible for the cost of traveling on to their homes, the embassy said.
The Canadian government on Saturday said that it, too, will repatriate its citizens on the Diamond Princess. A government-chartered plane will bring passengers to a military base for screening and then to an air-traffic control training center for a 14-day quarantine.
The Diamond Princess was declared a quarantine zone on Feb.-5, so passengers had expected to be able to leave the ship beginning Wednesday. But as more tests were carried out on passengers and crew members, it became clear that a high percentage had contracted the virus, and experts warned that there was a risk it could still be spreading on the ship.
So far, 355 passengers and crew members have tested positive for the virus. There were 2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew members on the ship when it was placed under quarantine, but those found to have the virus have been taken to Japanese hospitals.
The situation on the Diamond Princess raised alarm about other cruise ships sailing around Asia, including the Westerdam, which had been stranded at sea for two weeks. Five ports denied the ship docking privileges, fearing that passengers could transmit the coronavirus, before the ship docked in Cambodia and passengers began to disembark on Friday.
On Saturday, Malaysian health authorities said an American passenger from the Westerdam tested positive for coronavirus after flying into Malaysia from Cambodia, Reuters reported. It's the first case of an infected person who had been on that ship. The woman was not identified by name.
The cruise ship said the passengers had been tested regularly onboard, and 20 were checked once more after the boat docked, with no positive cases. Cambodian health officials had cleared the woman on Friday to travel on to Malaysia, Reuters reported.
The woman and her husband, like 143 other passengers from the ship, flew to Malaysia on their way home. None of the other passengers showed coronavirus symptoms.
The woman was sent to isolation in a hospital and was in stable condition, the Malaysian health ministry said, according to Bloomberg News. Her husband, 85, tested negative for the virus but is under observation, the ministry said.
Holland America said in a statement Saturday that it was 'awaiting secondary testing for confirmation' of the American's case, and working with Malaysia, Cambodia and CDC authorities.
As the virus continues to spread rapidly in China, the country's leaders " after initially trying to suppress or play down the severity of the virus but discovering that belated efforts to contain it were not working " are trying to show that they are on top of the outbreak. Beijing is also increasingly worried about the impact on China's economy, which was already slowing.
All residents returning to Beijing are required to stay at home 'or submit to group observation' for 14-days, and those who refuse 'will be held accountable under law,' according to a notice issued Friday by the capital's virus prevention working group.
Analysts saw this as a sign that the virus is still spreading, but also that the Communist leaders are growing increasingly nervous about party meetings scheduled for the first week of March. The 'Two Sessions'bring thousands of party members from around the country to Beijing. 
In Wuhan, authorities moved to seal all residential compounds. The city's 11-million residents had been placed under a kind of emergency law, which stipulates that only one member of each household could go out once every three days to buy groceries and other supplies. But now, only people who are seeking medical treatment or working on epidemic prevention and control will be allowed to leave residential complexes.
In Shanghai, people returning from areas 'hit hard by the epidemic' are required to quarantine themselves. But the city is trying to dissuade those who don't come from or work in the city from entering. People in Shanghai's airports and train stations must have their temperature checked and be registered against their name.
In Paris, French Health Minister Agnès Buzyn said Saturday that an 80-year-old man from Hubei province had succumbed to the illness after being hospitalized in Paris, along with his daughter, since Jan.-25. The daughter is expected to be discharged soon.
On the Diamond Princess, the news of an additional quarantine period was a blow to some of the Americans, who say they had been repeatedly told otherwise by U.S. officials.
'Why didn't they test everybody [earlier], and it would have been over?' asked Melanie Haering, 58, of Tooele, Utah, echoing a question many people have asked from the beginning.

U.S. stocks were little changed Friday but ended the week with gains as investors' concerns about a sharp rise in coronavirus cases faded.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite swung between small gains and losses Friday and ended the session higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered a modest loss.
The S&P 500 rose 6.22 points, or 0.2%, to 3380.16, a new record. The Nasdaq Composite added 19.21 points, or 0.2% to 9731.18, also a new high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 25.23 points, or 0.1%, to 29398.08. All three indexes notched gains of at least 1% for the week.
Investors grew concerned about when the coronavirus outbreak might peak after Chinese authorities changed the criteria for diagnosis earlier in the week, leading to a dramatic increase in the number of new cases. But stocks in the U.S. and in Europe largely continued rallying on faith that central banks and governments would take steps to shield the global economy from the impact of the outbreak.
"The market wants to believe this is a one-quarter blip and we're back to the races," said Neil Dwane, global strategist at Allianz Global Investors.
Additionally, earnings have continued to largely beat investors expectations. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 1.587%.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said it is temporarily halting production at a car factory in Serbia because it can't get parts from China, a sign of how the coronavirus outbreak is creating a domino effect in a straining global supply chain.
At the same time, union officials at two major General Motors Co. factories in the U.S. are warning more production outages could come as certain parts at SUV and truck plants in Michigan and Texas run low.
Fiat Chrysler's planned shutdown next week at a factory in Kragujevac, Serbia, is the first publicly disclosed closure of a large car plant outside Asia. Shortages of China-made parts have already begun to ripple through the automotive supply chain, leading Hyundai Motor Co. and France's Renault SA to temporarily idle some assembly lines in South Korea. Nissan Motor Co. has had to adjust production at some of its plants in Japan because of problems getting parts from China.
Fiat Chrysler said it was moving up a planned shutdown previously planned for later in the month at the factory, which makes the Fiat 500L sedan. The factory, Fiat Chrysler's only one making the 500L, has more than 2,000 employees. That stoppage had been scheduled to adjust production to slumping demand. The company said it didn't expect the change in scheduling will affect its total monthly production. Fiat Chrysler said it is working to get the parts, which it declined to identify, from other suppliers. It declined to comment further.
Closer to home, a factory in Flint, Mich., which makes heavy-duty versions of GM's Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks, faces shortages of at least two parts sourced from China, said Chad Fabbro, a financial secretary at the United Auto Workers' local representing workers at the plant. In Arlington, Texas, GM's assembly plant is confronting the possibility of running out of certain parts from China, said Terry Valenzuela, president of UAW's local chapter. The situation remains fluid, he said. That factory makes Cadillac Escalades and Chevrolet Suburbans.
GM said it doesn't anticipate an impact on truck production for now. "We continue to monitor our supply chain and are in close communications with our Tier One suppliers to mitigate any risk to production in North America," the company said in a statement.
"The car industry is in a supply chain twilight zone right now," said Warren Browne, a former car industry executive who now works as a consultant. "If you know it's going to last six or seven months you start moving production around. If it's going to be six weeks you don't move anything because it's not worth the trouble."
The outbreak of the disease that health authorities are now calling Covid-19 led China's government to impose extended shutdowns of manufacturing plants throughout the country after the traditional break for the Lunar New Year holiday, in hopes of slowing the disease's spread.
Many auto companies said they planned to restart plants in China this week. It is unclear how many have. Analysts say the impact of supply-chain disruptions and worker quarantines make it difficult to anticipate when production will return to normal.
The outbreak has halted assembly lines at several car plants in China, and forecasters at LMC Automotive expect the outbreak to depress Chinese auto production by around 1.2 million cars this quarter. Last year, GM produced nearly 640,000 cars -- nearly 40% of its Chinese production -- in Hubei province, the origin of the outbreak where most of the infections have been diagnosed, LMC Automotive said.
The factory in Flint is one of GM's largest U.S. factories, employing about 5,000 workers. The plant would likely run out of decals and vents first, both of which can be installed after a near-finished truck rolls off the assembly line, Mr. Fabbro said. But longer delays could affect more critical components, he said.
"This is going to be a day-by-day monitoring thing," he said. "If it goes six weeks, then we all have bigger problems."
GM has arranged for parts to be flown by chartered jet from China when parts are available, he said. A GM spokesman declined to comment.

WASHINGTON -- Consumer spending in the U.S. picked up slightly in January after a weak holiday season, while manufacturing started the year on a decline, suggesting forces that slowed 2019 growth continued at the start of this year.
Government and survey data released Friday showed consumers remained upbeat, but the manufacturing industry was struggling. "There seems to be this ongoing dichotomy between business and the consumer sector," said Gregory Daco, an economist at Oxford Economics.
Business investment declined in three out of four quarters in 2019, and remained constrained by weak global growth, trade tensions and now China's coronavirus outbreak that threatens to upend global supply chains.
Industrial production, a measure of factory, mining and utility output, decreased a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in January from the prior month, the Federal Reserve said Friday. Utilities production dropped 4% last month, as Americans cut back on energy consumption during a warmer-than-usual January.
The halt in production of Boeing Co.'s 737 MAX airplane, which started in January, led to a 7.4% decrease in the aerospace industry's production last month. Economists expect Boeing's troubles to affect first-quarter U.S. economic growth, along with economic ripples from the coronavirus.
Consumers in the U.S. remained upbeat, however. A University of Michigan survey released Friday said the index of consumer sentiment increased to 100.9 this month from 99.8 at the end of January, close to the postrecession peak of 101.4 set in March 2018. The coronavirus was mentioned by just 7% of respondents when asked about their economic expectations in early February.
Consumers are spending, too, after a weak holiday season. Retail sales, a measure of purchases at stores, at restaurants and online, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in January from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said Friday. That was the strongest pace of growth since October, after December's holiday retail sales were revised down slightly, to a 0.2% rise.
January was the fifth warmest for the month on record for the U.S., according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Mild winter weather was a boon to consumer spending in certain categories, such as home-improvement stores, restaurants and bars.
But it hurt spending in other categories, such as apparel, as consumers held off on purchases of winter coats and boots. Clothing sales dropped 3.1% from December, the largest month-over-month decrease in that category since March 2009.
"Once you incorporate the utility effect, the [weather] impact has probably been marginally negative" on overall consumer spending, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.
Consumer spending is the main driver of the U.S. economy, accounting for more than two-thirds of economic output. It rose at a weak 1.8% annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2019, down from a 3.2% rate in the third quarter, and Friday's report offered few signs that the pace of household outlays picked up meaningfully in the first month of 2020.
Still, factors driving U.S. consumer spending remain positive. Unemployment was a low 3.6% in January, and average hourly earnings posted a 3.1% year-over-year gain, suggesting households have money to spend.
Some retailers are circumspect about the prospects for 2020. Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette said recently that while the economy is still healthy, he is mindful "that it's not going to be as strong as it was in the two previous years."

EXCHANGE --- Markets News -- Commodities: Oil Prices Brush Off Growing Supplies

Oil prices rose this week, snapping a five-week losing streak and shrugging off a downbeat U.S. inventory report, lower forecasts for growth in crude demand and fresh worries about the scope of the coronavirus outbreak in China.
U.S. crude futures rose 3.4% to $52.05 a barrel for the week after posting a 1.2% gain on Friday. Brent, the global gauge of prices, rose 5.2% for the week to $57.32 a barrel and climbed 1.7% on Friday.
Prices climbed even after the Energy Information Administration reported that domestic crude stockpiles rose by 7.5 million barrels the previous week, more than double the 2.9-million-barrel rise that analysts and traders surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had predicted.
On Thursday, the IEA slashed its oil-demand growth forecast for 2020 by 30%, or 365,000 barrels a day, citing a likely economic slowdown in China related to the coronavirus outbreak there.
The day before, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reduced its estimates for oil-demand growth by 230,000 barrels a day.
And a jump in China's daily count of new coronavirus cases has raised fresh concerns over the disease's trajectory and whether China is offering an accurate appraisal of the epidemic's reach. Fears about the virus's effect on oil demand have helped drive U.S. crude prices down about 15% so far this year.
At least some of crude's move upward this week is due to short sellers covering bets that oil prices would fall, some analysts said. Prices began to advance earlier in the week following a burst of optimism about a possible slowdown in the virus's spread.
Crude's recent rise follows a sharp decline over the past several weeks that now "is being replaced by accumulation as well as short covering from speculators who have recently entered the market," Ritterbusch &Associates analysts wrote in a note.
Elsewhere in commodities, natural-gas futures rose 0.6% to $1.837 per million British thermal units on Friday. A mild winter has weighed on prices, pushing futures to their lowest level in nearly four years earlier this past week.

WASHINGTON—Consumer spending in the U.S. picked up slightly in January after a weak holiday season, while manufacturing started the year on a decline.
Retail sales, a measure of purchases at stores, at restaurants and online, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in January from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said Friday.

Consumer spending is the main driver of the U.S. economy, accounting for more than two-thirds of economic output.
One positive for future spending is that consumer confidence remains high. A University of Michigan survey released Friday said the index of consumer sentiment increased to 100.9 this month from 99.8 at the end of January.
While data on retail sales can be volatile from month to month, the broader trend shows that consumer spending remains relatively robust: from a year earlier, retail sales increased 4.4% in January.
Higher retail sales last month will feed into the broader pace of economic growth for the first quarter. Still, the report showed spending was uneven across the board. Gasoline sales dropped by 0.5%, the most since August, amid lower gas prices last month .
Unlike other reports produced by the government, retail sales aren't adjusted for price changes. Sales at electronics and health care stores posted sharp declines, and clothing sales dropped 3.1% from December, the largest month-over-month decrease in that category since March 2009.

Consumer spending rose at a weak 1.8% annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2019, down from a 3.2% rate in the third quarter, and Friday's report offered few signs that the pace picked up meaningfully in the first month of 2020.
Still, factors driving U.S. consumer spending remain positive. Unemployment was a low 3.6% in January , and average hourly earnings posted a 3.1% year-over-year gain, suggesting households have money to spend.
"The economy is on stable ground," payroll-processing company Automatic Data Processing Inc.'s Chief Executive Carlos Rodriguez said during an earnings call on Jan. 29. Wage growth is "still at robust levels and should drive continued consumer spending and continued consumer confidence," he said.
Some retailers are circumspect about the prospects for 2020. Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette said last week that while the economy is still healthy, he is mindful "that it's not going to be as strong as it was in the two previous years."
On Jan. 15, the U.S. and China signed a trade deal in which the U.S. agreed to cut tariffs on $120 billion in Chinese goods by half, to 7.5%, and to forgo other planned tariffs. But the deal leaves in place U.S. tariffs on about $370 billion in Chinese goods, or about three-quarters of Chinese imports to the U.S.
January also saw the first confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S., and in late January the U.S. imposed entry restrictions on foreign nationals and quarantines on Americans returning from the Chinese province at the center of the outbreak. While the impact of coronavirus on the U.S. so far has been minimal, a worsening of the outbreak could dent consumer confidence down the line and has already disrupted some U.S. retailers' operations overseas.
Ralph Lauren Corp. temporarily closed around two-thirds of its mainland China stores over the past week due to coronavirus. The fashion house said Thursday it would take a hit in its current quarter of $55 million to $70 million in sales, and $35 million to $45 million in operating income in Asia, due to the outbreak.
"The company also expects broader impact across its businesses in China and parts of Asia due to significantly reduced travel and retail traffic," Ralph Lauren said.

Trump's Tariff Threats Are Tested by Europe's Record Trade Surplus; Europe's surplus, a bone of contention for the president, rises amid efforts toward a new EU trade deal

Europe's trade surplus with the U.S. hit a record high in 2019, amid renewed threats from President Trump to place tariffs on European Union goods if the bloc doesn't agree to a new deal .
The EU's surplus with the U.S. stood at €152.6 billion ($165.5 billion) last year, an 11% increase over 2018.
The surplus has sparked sharp comments from the U.S. president, who said this week his administration would refocus on trade talks with the EU following a recent agreement with China. Mr. Trump wants to reach a deal with the EU before the November election and has threatened to levy tariffs on European goods if the talks fail.
"Europe has been treating us very badly," he said Monday. "Over the last 10, 12 years there's been a tremendous deficit with Europe. They have barriers that are incredible."
The U.S.-EU trade talks have progressed little due to a number of differences, most notably concerning U.S. insistence that Europe open its giant agricultural market to American businesses.
The European Union's statistics agency Friday said the 27 members of the bloc imported €231.7 billion in goods from the U.S. during the year, an increase of 8.6% from 2018. European exports to the U.S. rose 9.5% to €384.4 billion.
Among the goods singled out by Mr. Trump for tariff increases are automobiles. According to Rabobank, an increase in U.S. import duties on cars would hit Germany particularly hard, with production in Europe's largest automobile industry falling as much as 5% if a tariff of 25% were imposed.
That fresh blow would fall at a challenging time for Germany. Figures also released Friday showed its economy stalled at the end of last year, as the export powerhouse wrestled with tensions in global trade, turbulence in its large auto industry and a slowdown in China.
The country's economy grew at its slowest pace in six years during 2019, held back by a drop in exports to the U.K. and a slowdown in sales to Chinese buyers. A pickup in sales to the U.S. was a bright spot, although imports rose even more rapidly, leading to a narrowing of its trade surplus.

Germany has been flirting with recession for a year and a half, with no end in sight. Its slowdown has rippled across the entire continent, prompting a fresh burst of stimulus in September from the European Central Bank.
Economists expect the slump could deepen if the coronavirus in China hits the global supply chains on which Germany's export-oriented car and capital goods manufacturing sectors depend. German growth will likely slow further to 0.5% in 2020, according to economists at Allianz.
German exports to China could fall around 5% in the first quarter of 2020 due to the coronavirus-induced shutdown, slicing about 0.2 percentage point off German growth, especially as some companies could suffer from a lack of deliveries from China, said Joerg Kraemer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
Germany isn't the EU's only soft spot. A separate release from Eurostat on Friday showed that none of the bloc's three largest economies managed to record an increase in economic activity during the final three months of 2019, with France and Italy experiencing contractions. It was left to Spain and the Netherlands to drive the meager, 0.2% increase in eurozone gross domestic product at the end of last year.
According to economists, the faster rate of growth in the U.S. is one reason for its widening trade deficit with the EU, with recent tax cuts spurring higher spending by businesses and households, some of which goes on imports.
While U.S. complaints have focused on the EU's protection of its farmers and other barriers to trade, the Trump administration also has urged European governments—and that of Germany in particular—to cut taxes as a spur to growth. Germany's government has indicated it has no plans to ramp up spending.

U.S. stocks were little changed Friday but ended the week with gains as investors' concerns about a sharp rise in coronavirus cases faded.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite swung between small gains and losses Friday and ended the session higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered a modest loss.
The S&P 500 rose 6.22 points, or 0.2%, to 3380.16, a new record. The Nasdaq Composite added 19.21 points, or 0.2% to 9731.18, also a new high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 25.23 points, or 0.1%, to 29398.08. All three indexes notched gains of at least 1% for the week.
Investors grew concerned about when the coronavirus outbreak might peak after Chinese authorities changed the criteria for diagnosis earlier in the week, leading to a dramatic increase in the number of new cases. But stocks in the U.S. and in Europe largely continued rallying on faith that central banks and governments will take steps to shield the global economy from the impact of the outbreak.
"The market wants to believe this is a one-quarter blip and we're back to the races," said Neil Dwane, global strategist at Allianz Global Investors.
Additionally, earnings have continued to largely beat investors expectations, helping give stocks a boost.
Some investors said they remained optimistic about the trajectory for U.S. stocks this year, despite nagging concerns about the virus.
"As the year progresses, we're in a pretty strong place to continue to surprise on the upside," said Wayne Wicker, chief investment officer at Vantagepoint Investment Advisers. "These types of issues--while tragic--in and of themselves are short lived."
Still, some of the jitters that were on display earlier in the week were more apparent in the market for government bonds.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.587%, according to Tradeweb, from 1.616% Thursday as fresh data released Friday showed that U.S. retail sales increased 0.3% in January from the month prior, in line with expectations. Though the report showed that spending is on steady footing, spending was uneven across the board. Clothing and gasoline sales dropped while U.S. auto sales increased.
There were signs of fresh tensions between Washington and Beijing that emerged overnight after the U.S. charged Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei and two of its U.S. units with racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to steal trade secrets. Tensions between the two nations had roiled markets for large parts of last year, and eased only briefly after they sealed an initial trade accord that failed to address a number of crucial issues.
"We always thought the 'phase one' trade deal would not actually resolve tensions between the U.S. and China," said Simona Gambarini, markets economist at Capital Economics in London. "The two economies are based on totally different foundations."
Shares of some individual companies recorded bigger moves Friday. Nvidia advanced $19.01, or 7%, to $289.79 after the graphics-chip maker's fourth-quarter earnings topped Wall Street's expectations . Nvidia's lurch higher to a new record helped the S&P 500's information technology sector outperform the broader market, rising 0.5%.
Expedia Group gained $12.21, or 11%, to $122.80 after the online travel company projected cost savings and growth in a measure of profit for this year.
Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 index slipped 0.1% and the Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.4% higher.

Xi ousts pair of officials amid outrage over virus response

President Xi Jinping summarily ousted two top Communist Party officials from the province at the center of the coronavirus epidemic Thursday, exacting political punishment for the regional government's handling of a crisis that seemed far from under control. 
The reshuffling of the party leadership in the province, Hubei, and its capital, Wuhan, reflected an effort by Xi to contain not only the political and economic damage of the epidemic but also any simmering public anger among millions of people locked down now for more than three weeks.
The Communist Party replaced both officials with proteges of Xi who have extensive backgrounds in public security.
The moves, announced in terse statements in state news media, came as the number of deaths and infections skyrocketed by the highest amounts in any day. The rise, in part, reflected changes in the way infections in Hubei are counted, but the latest figures confirmed warnings that the true scale of the epidemic remains muddled.
The death toll from the virus, known officially as COVID-19, reached 1,367 Thursday, up 254 from a day earlier, and the number of confirmed cases jumped to 59,804, up 15,152.
"The personnel changes can be spun as Beijing finally taking decisive action and beginning the process of sheeting home responsibility for the crisis," said Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, using a nautical idiom meaning to fix blame, "but they also reek a little of panic."
Only the day before, Xi presided over a third emergency session of the country's top political body, the Politburo Standing Committee, and declared that the government's efforts were beginning to have "positive effects."
"All regions and departments performed their duties actively and conscientiously," Xi said, once again referring to the fight against the epidemic as a "people's war."
Xi's reassuring remarks made the dismissals, like the rise in new cases and deaths, even more of a surprise.
In a separate move that underscored similar concerns, the government's highest body, the State Council, announced that it had appointed another Xi protege to take over the national office overseeing Hong Kong, which has been roiled by protests since last summer and by the coronavirus now.
At Wednesday's meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, Xi urged officials to do everything possible to improve the care of those sickened in Hubei. At the same time, he urged them to make sure that business returned to normal and that the government met its economic development goals for the year, according to an official summary of the meeting by Xinhua, the state-run news agency.
Meanwhile, U.S. officials Thursday announced the country's 15th confirmed case of the new coronavirus -- an evacuee from China who had been under quarantine in Texas.
The patient, who had been flown to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio last week, was reported in stable condition. The infection was confirmed Wednesday night, making the person the first coronavirus patient in Texas.

The U.S. Treasury Department sold 30-year bonds at a record low yield on Thursday, highlighting investors' demand for longer-term debt and its benefits to the government.
The Treasury sold $19 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday afternoon at a 2.061% yield. That beat the previous record of 2.170% set last October, according to data from BMO Capital Markets.
The auction came as Treasury yields generally moved lower after Chinese officials changed the way they counted coronavirus infections, leading to a big jump in the number of confirmed cases in the country's Hubei province. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 1.616%, compared with 1.629% Wednesday.
Yields fall when bond prices rise.
Fear that the coronavirus will slow global growth has helped push down Treasury yields in recent weeks. Other factors include persistently soft inflation, which has limited one of the main threats to the value of longer-term Treasurys, analysts said.
Investors have also grown more comfortable buying 30-year bonds because they view them as insurance against losses in riskier assets, said Jon Hill, a U.S. interest-rates strategist at BMO. Prices of 30-year bonds increase more for every one-percentage point decline in yields than those of shorter-term bonds. That means on days like Thursday, when investors are selling stocks and buying bonds, the holders of 30-year bonds are well-hedged, Mr. Hill said.
Thursday's level isn't the lowest point that the 30-year bond yield has ever reached. Last August, it settled as low as 1.941%, but yields rose again before the next 30-year auction in September.

World News: Jump in Virus Cases Fuels New Worries --- Change in counting leads to sharp rise; some question when the outbreak will peak

New cases of the coronavirus rose sharply after Chinese authorities changed the criteria for diagnosing the illness, raising questions about how soon the outbreak will peak.
On Thursday, health officials in Hubei province, the epicenter of the infections, announced the largest one-day jump in cases -- 14,840 on Wednesday, about nine times the number of new cases a day earlier. Epidemiologists, government officials and investors might now need to recalibrate their projections for the trajectory of a virus that remains little understood.
In recent days, investors had pushed U.S. stocks to records as Chinese officials touted gains in the fight against the fast-spreading illness that has gripped central China for the past month, fixing their attention on one number -- a drop in the growth rate of new infections -- that suggested the virus was running out of steam.
Such a dramatic surge in cases as announced Thursday is likely a one-off. It reflects the shift in how Hubei province authorities are classifying patients as having clinically confirmed infections after they are diagnosed by a doctor, such as through an X-ray, rather than just counting those patients who have positive laboratory identification of the virus.
The new practice isn't a standard way to diagnose the presence of a specific virus.
"This does not represent a significant change in trajectory of the outbreak," said Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program. He called the jump in cases "an after-fact of reporting."
Dr. Ryan said the move would allow authorities to do more public-health investigations, such as by tracking down patients' contacts, which are needed to contain the outbreak.
The vast majority of Thursday's newly confirmed cases -- 13,332 -- were retroactively reclassified. But the broader classification rules mean the daily rise in the number of new cases could continue to gain because more undiagnosed cases might come to light.
Zhong Nanshan, head of a National Health Commission task force on the virus, sought in recent days to alleviate public fears by saying the outbreak might peak before March.
On Wednesday, just hours before Hubei health authorities announced their new numbers, China's official Xinhua News Agency touted a drop in the number of daily new confirmed cases. Xinhua noted it had steadily fallen from nearly 4,000 on Feb. 4 to just over 2,000 on Tuesday, citing National Health Commission data.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., pointing to those figures, told clients in a note Wednesday that "the spread of the virus has slowed, as the number of new confirmed cases nationwide has gradually declined." Shortly after, the U.S. stock market opened with the Dow Jones industrials popping.
The Thursday jump in cases threatens to damp that optimism, though experts remain divided on whether it changes the longer-term outlook.
Goldman, in a note after the new figures were released, said that while the sharp rise doesn't imply a renewed acceleration in the spread of Covid-19, as the disease is known, it would be "theoretically possible" to see other changes to the definition of cases in Hubei again or other provinces in the future.
Authorities don't yet have an accurate estimate of the number of infected people in Wuhan, Chen Yixin said earlier this week. Mr. Chen, a top law-enforcement official from Beijing helping oversee the crisis in Wuhan, added that "the base number of potentially infected Wuhan may still be relatively large."
John Nicholls, a coronavirus expert and clinical professor of pathology at the University of Hong Kong, said that the "change in criteria doesn't mean that there is a rise in the actual infections" but rather it is "casting a wider net to pick up what the true incidence of the infection is."
Mr. Nicholls, however, warned that the reclassification of earlier cases in Hubei will "provide a challenge for retrospective analysis of data," making it more difficult to get a sense of the larger trajectory of the coronavirus's spread.
Hubei province's Thursday tally of 242 deaths included 135 patients who had been only clinically diagnosed with the coronavirus. It didn't count any earlier deaths that had been only clinically diagnosed.
Excluding Hubei province, the rest of China has continued to see a steady drop in the number of new cases, reporting just 312 Wednesday for a ninth straight day of declines.
Still, the outbreak could be more severe than figures suggest. Unlike Hubei, other parts of China still require either gene sequencing or lab tests to confirm the pathogen, meaning not all cases may be being detected and tallied.
Initially, health authorities in Hubei province had counted a patient as a confirmed infection case only if a laboratory test provided pathogenic evidence of the virus. Questions around the reliability of the test, however, pushed authorities to broaden their criteria to include clinical diagnoses, in which doctors can confirm a case based on symptoms.
In a document circulated to hospitals across China last week, the National Health Commission updated its case categories for Hubei to separate clinically diagnosed cases out from suspected cases. Hubei patients whose chest scan showed signs of pneumonia would be included in this category, while those whose chest scan didn't would remain as suspected cases.
Hubei's health commission said the goal was to let more patients be treated as confirmed cases, so that more could be cured. Officials spent the past few days combing through suspected cases, the statement said, to identify the thousands of cases added to the province's confirmed tally on Thursday, which now stands at more than 48,000 cases.
At the same time, Hubei began blanket screening using the looser diagnostic standards, picking up patients with fever whose chest scans showed lung infections, and sending them to designated hospitals.
Only 20% to 30% of all pneumonia cases can be proven in testing to be linked to any pathogen, Tong Zhaohui, a respiratory disease doctor from Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, told China's state broadcaster.
The policy shift was motivated in part by a recent increase in hospital capacity in Wuhan, including two newly opened prefabricated hospitals, according to Hu Yang, a respiratory diseases expert based in Shanghai.

Oil Demand Set to Post Rare Quarterly Drop

LONDON -- Global oil demand is expected to fall in the first three months of the year -- the first quarterly drop in more than a decade -- according to a closely watched forecast from the International Energy Agency.
The agency blamed a likely economic slowdown in China related to the coronavirus outbreak there.
The IEA also slashed its oil- demand growth forecast for 2020 by 365,000 barrels a day, a cut of 30% to its previous forecast made in January. The IEA warned of a drop in oil demand this quarter of 435,000 barrels a day, compared with a year ago. That would represent the first quarterly drop in demand since the height of the financial crisis.
Brent crude rose 1% to $56.34 a barrel but is still 18% below a peak hit early last month. U.S. crude oil added 0.5% to $51.42 a barrel and has also tumbled in recent weeks.
The IEA's cut to its forecast demand growth was significantly larger than the one announced Wednesday by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which reduced its estimate by 230,000 barrels a day.
"The consequences of [the virus] for global oil demand will be significant," the IEA said in its report. It said "there is already a major slowdown in oil consumption and the wider economy in China."
The Paris-based energy watchdog said China accounted for more than three-quarters of global oil demand growth in 2019, and its oil demand has more than doubled since the outbreak of the SARS virus in 2003. "There is little doubt that the virus will have a larger impact on the economy and oil demand than did SARS," the IEA said.
Economists have lowered their forecasts for Chinese economic growth since the city of Wuhan was sealed off on Jan. 23, and it became clear that factories and other businesses would suffer a loss of output as officials scrambled to contain the spread of the virus.
Assuming that and other lockdowns are lifted in April, economists expect the damage to Chinese growth to be limited, with gross domestic product likely to be around 3% to 4% higher than a year earlier in the first three months of the year. Growth had previously been forecast at 5%, although economists expect much of that lost output to be recouped as the year advances, with only a limited impact on the global economy. Releasing new forecasts Thursday, the European Commission said it expects to see "relatively limited global spillovers."
Weaker forecasts for oil demand come after double-digit-percentage drops in oil prices this year, with the spread of the pathogen forcing border closures, flight cancellations and other travel restrictions across China.
The IEA reported that Chinese jet-fuel demand will fall 14% below last month's forecast for 2020's first quarter, while the country's diesel and gasoline demand figures would fall 12% and 13% below last month's forecasts, respectively.
Reduced demand as a result of the coronavirus will also sting global refiners, the agency said, reducing its global refinery runs forecast for 2020 to 700,000 barrels a day. New bunker fuel regulations stipulated by the International Maritime Organization boosted sweet crude refinery margins, though.
The IEA noted an 800,000 barrel-a-day decline in global oil supply, 710,000 barrels of which appeared to be accounted for by OPEC. In December, OPEC agreed with its allies to deepen production cuts by 500,000 barrels to 1.7 million barrels a day until the end of March.
The United Arab Emirates was responsible for 300,000 barrels a day of that reduction, the IEA said.
It said production in Libya -- strained by blockades amid the latest developments in its near-decade-long civil war -- dropped 360,000 barrels a day.
Some OPEC nations have attempted to bring forward the meeting scheduled for early March between the cartel and its allies, known as OPEC+. The organization's technical committee last week recommended deepening and extending current cuts.

A rally in stocks paused after an increase in the number of new coronavirus cases in the Chinese province at the epicenter of a global outbreak.
Chinese officials reported the number of newly confirmed infections in Hubei surged overnight. That raised the prospect of a longer period of economic disruption than investors had anticipated and weighed on markets that had climbed for much of the past two weeks.
The rising number of cases has prompted "renewed concern around the dynamics of the coronavirus," said James McCormick, a strategist at NatWest Markets. "Having had several days of relative calm, it's a bit of a wake-up call that this process is probably going to go on for quite some time."
He said investors became "a bit complacent" in recent days as the number of new cases appeared to have slowed, helping push equity markets in the U.S. and Europe to records.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 128.11 points, or 0.4%, to 29423.31, retreating from a record set the prior day. The S&P 500 declined 5.51 points, or 0.2%, to 3373.94 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 13.99 points, or 0.1%, to 9711.97.
Although the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. remains low, analysts said disruption to business and travel in China could ripple through the American economy.
A drop-off in tourism and slowdown in exports to China could pull down annualized U.S. growth by half a percentage point in the first quarter, according to economists at Goldman Sachs Group.
Among individual stocks, shares of Cisco Systems fell $2.61, or 5.2%, to $47.32 after the telecom-gear maker said economic uncertainties had delayed investment decisions at some companies, denting its sales growth.
MGM Resorts fell $1.86, or 5.5%, to $31.80 after the resort operator withdrew its 2020 forecast, citing uncertainty around the coronavirus outbreak, and said Chief Executive Jim Murren was stepping down.
Haven assets climbed, with gold for February delivery rising 0.5% to $1,575.10 a troy ounce.
"As time goes on, people are realizing more of the telltale signs of the economic impact" of coronavirus, said Cliff Tan, East Asian head of markets research at MUFG.
In one such sign, Chinese auto sales dropped 18% in January to 1.94 million vehicles, according to data from the government-backed China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Car sales typically slide during the Lunar New Year holiday, but Mr. Tan said he expects them to tumble further in February. "How can you buy a car if you can't get to the dealership?" he said.
Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 retreated less than 0.1%, and the Shanghai Composite Index closed down 0.7%.
At midday in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei was down 0.5%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.7% and the Shanghai Composite was up 0.6%.
The British pound rose 0.6% against the dollar after Sajid Javid, chancellor of the Exchequer, stepped down.
Sterling rose on the basis that "this could mean a stronger hand on the fiscal controls" for Prime Minister Boris Johnon, said John Wraith, rates strategist at UBS Group. "The prospect for more significant fiscal loosening or fiscal stimulus is greater."
Investors have overreacted to Mr. Javid's resignation, according to Mr. Wraith. The departure appeared to be the result of a political power struggle rather than a clash over economic policy, he said.

Japan relaxes cruise ship quarantine for elderly amid fears of virus spread

YOKOHAMA, Japan " Japan announced a new plan Thursday to gradually test passengers on board the stricken Diamond Princess for the new coronavirus and allow some to disembark before the end of the quarantine period, as fears rise that the virus may still be circulating on board the cruise ship.
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said Thursday that 44-more people on board have tested positive for the new coronavirus on the quarantined cruise liner, bringing to 218 the total found to have the virus, including 21-crew members.
On shore, Japan announced its first death from the coronavirus, a woman in her 80s in Kanagawa Prefecture, the same region outside Tokyo where the ship is docked, and three more cases of the virus. 
That news will put further strain on Japan's limited ability to test people for the virus and pose some tough questions on where to concentrate limited resources.
For now, though, there is a new focus on getting people off the Diamond Princess, after a sharp rise in the number of people found to have the virus.
Amid mounting criticism, Japan's government changed course on Thursday, announcing that it would begin a phased program of testing, where passengers who have no trace of the virus will gradually be allowed to disembark before the quarantine ends on Feb.-19, on a voluntary basis.
Kato said the program would begin with the most medically vulnerable people, the more than 200-people in their 80s on board, and those with health problems that put them at particular risk. Priority will also be given to people with indoor, windowless cabins, while gradually extending the age range of evacuees.
They will be taken to a quarantine facility with individual rooms and bathrooms, but no medical clinics on site, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wrote in a letter emailed to the American passengers on board.
So far, more than 30-percent of the 713-people on board who have been tested for the virus have been found to have been infected. That makes it statistically virtually certain that more people among the 2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew have the virus.
While the CDC and the World Health Organization have backed the Japanese government's handling of what is an unprecedented health crisis, questions continue to be asked why Tokyo didn't move more quickly to test people on board and get them off the ship. 
'I personally believe that this [quarantine] is a fundamental violation of human rights, and it's a very risky situation to be in,' said Lauren Sauer, director of Operations with the Johns Hopkins Office of Critical Event Preparedness and Response. 'There are so many people on the ship who are potentially now exposed, and their risk continues every minute they are on the ship.'
Hong Kong tested 1,800 crew members on board another cruise ship, the World Dream, in just a few days and allowed everyone to disembark, but Japan has limited capacity to test for the virus and competing demands from around the country of 127 million people, officials say, with 32 confirmed cases of coronavirus already.
Last week, a government official said the country could test 1,000 people a day nationally. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe spoke of administering 300 tests a day to boat passengers but said the government aimed to raise that number to 1,000 by the time the cruise ship's quarantine is over, so people can be tested before being released. 
But tests are not completely reliable, nor would they have been a panacea, experts said.
'Looking at the way a typical norovirus outbreak would be handled, they wouldn't keep them on the ship; they would get them off the ship . . . to make sure they are not at risk of ongoing exposure,' said David Hamer, a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health and School of Medicine. 'I think it's really hard to prevent continued transmission in a context like that. It might have made more sense to act differently in the beginning.'

Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams PHOTO: Gabe Palacio for The Wall Street Journal
NEW YORK—Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said Thursday the central bank's rate cuts last year put the economy on a path to continue its expansion, and he said what happens next with interest-rate policy depends on what happens with the data.
Three rate cuts last year "positioned us well to keep the economy growing above trend, GDP growth was about 2 ¼% last year, I think it's going to be about the same this year based on what we have, and that's going to generate continued strong labor markets and inflation around 2%," Mr. Williams said in an appearance before a bankers' group in New York.
Mr. Williams said "the baseline outlook I laid out is pretty darn good" but there are uncertainties, including from overseas growth issues and what is happening with the novel coronavirus, which causes the illness known as Covid-19, in China.
In that environment, "we just have to go back to our data dependence: Adjust or make plans, adjust the plans as the information is coming in. There is a lot of risk management to this," Mr. Williams said.
Mr. Williams's comments were his first since the Fed's late January rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and this week's appearance before Congress by central bank leader Jerome Powell. The Fed chairman told Congress he expects continued growth and a healthy job market, while once again affirming the central bank's consensus outlook that after three rate cuts last year, monetary policy will likely hold steady for now.
Mr. Williams, who also serves as vice chairman of the FOMC, has largely echoed the views of Mr. Powell in recent comments, and was a supporter of last year's rate cuts.
Over recent days, Fed officials have novel coronavirus situation in China as a factor adding uncertainty to the outlook. Some regional Fed officials have said a bad situation on that front, should it arise, could open the door to lowering rates to help keep the U.S. economy moving forward.
In his remarks, Mr. Williams also commented on the Fed's ongoing effort to calm money market volatility that initially flared in September. The Fed restored order by providing massive amounts of temporary liquidity to banks, which it has slowly been winding down this year. It hopes to end temporary offerings in April as it buys Treasury bills to bolster underlying banking sector reserve levels.
There are enduring questions whether September's stress was related to temporary factors or whether it was a sign of structural problems in short-term interest-rate markets.
Last week, the Fed's top bank regulator, Randal Quarles, laid out a plan that would reinvigorate the Fed's emergency lending discount window as a tool to help short-term stress, but there is uncertainty around that plan. Some also see regulatory problems, which could be slower to fix, as a factor adding friction to money markets.
Mr. Williams said efforts to restore calm in money markets have been effective. "Things are going very well" and the Fed has the control it wants over the federal-funds rate, the focus on monetary policy.

A rally in U.S. stocks paused Thursday after a spike in the number of new coronavirus cases in the Chinese province at the epicenter of a global outbreak.
Chinese officials reported the number of newly confirmed infections in Hubei jumped nearly 10-fold overnight . That raised the prospect of a longer period of economic disruption than investors previously anticipated and weighed on markets that had climbed for much of the past two weeks.
The number of newly confirmed infections in the province jumped to more than 14,000 on Wednesday, from 1,638 a day earlier, after the provincial health commission started to count clinically diagnosed cases, on top of people with a positive laboratory test.
The rising number of cases has prompted "renewed concern around the dynamics of the coronavirus," said James McCormick, a strategist at NatWest Markets. "Having had several days of relative calm, it's a bit of a wake-up call that this process is probably going to go on for quite some time."
Investors became "a bit complacent" in recent days as the number of new cases appeared to have slowed, helping push equity markets in the U.S. and Europe to all-time highs, Mr. McCormick said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 128.11 points, or 0.4%, to 29423.31, retreating from a record set the prior day. The S&P 500 declined 5.51 points, or 0.2%, to 3373.94 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 13.99 points, or 0.1%, to 9711.97.
Although the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. remains low, analysts said disruption to business and travel in China could ripple through the American economy. A drop-off in tourism and slowdown in exports to China could pull down annualized U.S. growth by half a percentage point in the first quarter, according to economists at Goldman Sachs Group.
Among individual stocks, shares of Cisco Systems fell $2.61, or 5.2%, to $47.32 after the telecom gear maker said economic uncertainties had delayed investment decisions at some companies, denting its sales growth .
MGM Resorts fell $1.86, or 5.5%, to $31.80 after the resort operator withdrew its 2020 forecast, citing uncertainty around the coronavirus outbreak, and said its chief executive Jim Murren was stepping down.
Haven assets climbed, with gold for February delivery rising 0.5% to $1,575.10 a troy ounce.
"As time goes on, people are realizing more of the telltale signs of the economic impact" of coronavirus, said Cliff Tan, East Asian head of markets research at MUFG.
In one such sign, Chinese auto sales dropped 18% in January to 1.94 million vehicles, according to data from the government-backed China Association of Automobile Manufacturers on Thursday. Car sales typically slide during the Lunar New Year holiday, but Mr. Tan said he expects them to tumble further in February. "How can you buy a car if you can't get to the dealership?" he said.
Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 retreated less than 0.1%, and the Shanghai Composite Index closed down 0.7%.
The British pound rose 0.7% against the dollar after Sajid Javid, chancellor of the Exchequer, stepped down. Sterling rose on the basis that "this could mean a stronger hand on the fiscal controls'' for Prime Minister Boris Johnon, said John Wraith, rates strategist at UBS Group. "The prospect for more significant fiscal loosening or fiscal stimulus is greater."
Investors have overreacted to Mr. Javid's resignation, according to Mr. Wraith. The departure appeared to be the result of a political power struggle rather than a clash over economic policy, he said.

China reports 14,840 new virus cases, 242 more deaths

The news seemed to be positive: The number of new coronavirus cases reported in China over the past week suggested that the outbreak might be slowing -- that containment efforts were working. Stocks ticked upward in the United States, as some analysts declared it safe again to invest in companies that depend on China. 
But Thursday, officials added more than 14,840 new cases to the tally of the infected in Hubei province alone, bringing the total number to 48,206 -- the largest one-day increase recorded. The death toll in the province rose to 1,310, including 242 new deaths.
The sharp rise in reported cases illustrates how hard it still is to grasp the extent and severity of the coronavirus outbreak in China, particularly inside the epicenter, where thousands of sick people remain untested for the illness.
The authorities were confronted by so many people with symptoms -- and such a shortage of kits to test officially for the virus -- that they had to change the way the illness is diagnosed.
Hospitals in Wuhan -- the largest city in Hubei province and the center of the epidemic -- have struggled to diagnose infections with scarce and complicated tests that detect the virus's genetic signature directly.
Officials now seem to be including infections observed on lung scans alone. This shortcut will help get more patients into needed care, provincial officials said, but it also shows the enormous number of people who are sick and have not been counted in the official tally of the outbreak.
The few experts to learn of the new numbers Wednesday night were startled.
"We're in unknown territory," said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.
Doctors in China probably don't have the chemicals necessary to perform complicated testing, and perhaps insufficient numbers of technicians, he speculated.
But lung scans are a perilous means to diagnose patients. Even patients with seasonal flu may develop pneumonia visible on a lung scan.
"They're talking about using this as another diagnostic test, but we haven't seen it validated by data," Schaffner said.
A social media campaign started by a physician in Wuhan last week called for using CT scans to simplify the screening of patients suspected of having the coronavirus and accelerate their hospitalization and treatment, instead of waiting for test results.
CT scans produce immediate results, she said, and Wuhan was running short of testing kits.
The change in diagnosis may make it harder to track the epidemic, said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, co-director of the University of Washington MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security.
"It makes it really confusing right now if they're changing the whole way they screen and detect," he said. Now estimating the scale of the epidemic "is a moving target."
The news is the latest in a set of confusing data points suggesting the epidemic is far from contained.

World Health Organization Criticized for Virus Response

BEIJING -- When the World Health Organization declared a global public-health emergency at the end of last month, it praised China's "extraordinary" efforts to combat the coronavirus epidemic and urged other countries not to restrict travel.
"China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
Many governments ignored the travel advice. Other public-health experts criticized his unqualified praise for China.
"It's very obvious to me -- it must be to most people in the world -- that Dr. Tedros and the WHO are caught in an awfully difficult position, between what the science dictates and a very, very powerful country," said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University who advises the WHO.
Among the complaints directed at Dr. Tedros: He was bending to Beijing by lauding a Chinese response that included quarantining 60 million people -- which many health experts see as inconsistent with WHO guidelines -- while calling on other countries not to cut off travel and trade with China.
In an interview Wednesday, Dr. Tedros denied the WHO bowed to Chinese pressure. He said China's actions don't contradict WHO standards and have slowed the virus's spread. "They are reducing the vulnerability of other countries," he said.
The coronavirus is presenting the United Nations agency with a conundrum that threatens its ability to lead global responses to such crises.
Over its decades of battling epidemics, the WHO has rarely had to deal with an entity as politically and economically powerful as China today. It can't afford to alienate the country's leadership, whose clout and financial largess it aims to attract to health causes. It needs Beijing's cooperation in preventing a full-blown pandemic -- and this may not be the last time. China is the source of many emerging pathogens, which jump from animals to humans in its teeming live markets.
The WHO's role is to marshal a global response to epidemics, to uphold international health regulations to which countries have agreed to adhere, and to make decisions and recommendations based on the best available science. That sometimes involves confronting a government where a public-health threat is unfolding.
Many people who work, or have worked, with the organization, and who study its operations, say that in not declaring a global health emergency earlier, the agency gave too much weight to China's concerns that the move would damage its economy and its leadership's image.
By praising China's response effusively, the WHO is compromising its own epidemic response standards, eroding its global authority, and sending the wrong message to other countries that might face future epidemics, they say.
"The WHO's message that no, don't anybody panic, keep travel flowing, keep the borders open, and then saying that we support the Chinese government is a mixed message," said Kelley Lee, a professor at Canada's Simon Fraser University who wrote a book on the WHO and co-established the WHO Collaborating Centre on Global Change and Health.
"A key issue is, who can we trust when we have these outbreaks," she said. "It really should be the WHO."
The WHO's advice against travel restrictions, which it says can cause disruption and unnecessary economic damage, is being widely ignored. Shortly after the global emergency was declared, the U.S. warned against all travel to China and banned entry to most travelers from there. More than a dozen other countries, including China's close friend Russia, followed with their own travel curbs.
China says it has been quick to share information on the outbreak, and blames the U.S. for setting a bad example in imposing unilateral travel restrictions.
"By taking strong measures, China is not just acting for the sake of its own people, but for people across the world," foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular news briefing Monday. China'sgovernment information office and national health commission didn't respond to requests for comment.
Dr. Tedros said in the interview that China's quarantine in Hubei province -- the outbreak's epicenter -- is consistent with the WHO's International Health Regulations, or IHR, a treaty signed by member states including China that calls for the least intrusive measures possible and strong protection for freedom of movement and other human rights. A quarantine is allowable "as long as a country takes measures that are proportionate to the problem they have," he said.
But, he said, "I think that human rights and so on should be respected." He said the WHO needs to monitor the situation to ensure movement of supplies isn't impaired. He said he also credits China with identifying the virus in "record time," sharing its genetic sequence quickly, and flagging potential international spread.
In a news conference last week, Dr. Tedros said his "very frank and very candid" meeting on Jan. 28 with China's Xi Jinping produced results, including an agreement to share data and send an team of international experts led by the WHO to China.
"During our visit we told them, you need to speed up, time is of the essence," he said in the interview.
Still, it took nearly two weeks for the agency to get a go-ahead from China to send even an advance team, which arrived in Beijing on Monday, to discuss a joint mission. The three-person team is discussing with Chinese officials the agenda and questions that the joint mission of about 10 international experts will pursue, Dr. Tedros said Monday.
"The WHO has to keep China on its side," said John Mackenzie, an infectious disease expert who is an emeritus professor at Australia's Curtin University and member of a WHO committee that advised Dr. Tedros on declaring a global public-health emergency. "China has a history in the past, of course, of clamming up when it wants to."
Dr. Mackenzie questioned why Chinese authorities appeared to delay reporting an increase in infections in the first half of January.Many health experts believe the outbreak spread more quickly early on because local authorities tried to cover it up, and then were slow to announce it could pass person-to-person.
"China is obviously an important player," said Dr. Mackenzie. "So everything the WHO does has to keep that in mind. At the same time, you can be overly effusive."
Since its founding in 1948, the WHO has played a critical role in coordinating global responses to public-health threats. Governed by its member countries, it has to respect national sovereignty.
The agency has improved its capabilities since 2014, when a slow, bureaucratic response to Ebola in West Africa helped fuel a global crisis. Concerned that the coronavirus will take off in other countries, the WHO is advising on how to detect and prevent its spread, coordinating research and distributing hundreds of thousands of test kits.
China's quarantine of Hubei province -- the largest in human history -- may yet prove effective, health experts say. But there's little scientific evidence that large, population-wide quarantines work. Such measures in the past have caused people to seek illicit escape routes, avoid reporting to authorities when sick and become physically hostile toward health workers.
"It's a very extreme measure, and quarantine has limited effectiveness" on this scale, said Devi Sridhar, an expert on global health at the University of Edinburgh who has worked with U.N. agencies and ministries of health in the developing world.
"The way they've gone about it is quite dangerous because you actually start to erode that trust in the government," she said. "You want citizens coming forward and saying: I feel unwell."
Striking the right balance with China has proved to be a challenge for governments, corporations and others in the democratic world. China is the second-biggest donor to the U.N.'s regular budget, after the U.S. China's importance to the WHO derives not so much as a current donor but as a future source of funds and a partner with which to tackle the biggest global health problems.
The WHO has supported China's building of medical centers and sending health teams to countries involved in its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure project.
Many health experts say China deserves credit for responding more quickly and effectively than it did to the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic that killed 774 people globally in 2002 and 2003. Beijing was widely criticized for covering up that epidemic for months.
One reason China became more active in the WHO since then, people involved say, was to ensure that Taiwan, the democratically self-governed island that Beijing considers part of its territory, wasn't a party to the IHR treaty. Taiwan isn't a member of the WHO.
Beijing then backed the appointment of Margaret Chan, a former director of health in Hong Kong, as WHO director-general from 2006 to 2017.
Since 2017, China has blocked Taiwan from attending the organization's annual World Health Assembly following the election of an independence-leaning president there.
Taiwan officials have repeatedly said that Beijing isn't sharing information about the outbreak with them. Beijing has said it has kept Taiwan, with 18 confirmed cases as of Monday, informed.
Some foreign government officials and public-health experts believe that Dr. Tedros, a former Ethiopian foreign minister, delayed declaring the global emergency last month partly in deference to China's concerns.
Dr. Tedros said that was not the case. "China never interfered on this," he said. "They didn't have any problem when we said we will focus on science."
To make that decision, the director-general can take into account factors including the views of the state concerned and the advice of an emergency committee -- in this case comprising 15 members, including one from China's National Health Commission and another from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as six expert advisers. Its discussions aren't made public.
The emergency committee failed to reach a consensus in a meeting on Jan. 22 and 23. Didier Houssin, the committee's chair, told a news conference the body was divided "almost 50-50." One side cited the increase in infections and the mounting evidence of the disease's severity, he said, while the other cited the limited number of cases abroad and China's countermeasures.
Ahead of the meeting's second day, China locked down three cities at the center of the epidemic -- Wuhan, Huanggang and Ezhou -- covering some 20 million people.China pressed the committee not to recommend an emergency, according to a person familiar with its deliberations. Dr. Tedros said China explained its position but didn't press. "Even if they did press, it wouldn't change anything," he said.
Most governments resist such a move when facing outbreaks within their borders, but it carries more weight coming from China, according to global health experts.
Dr. Tedros decided not to declare an emergency. The number of cases outside China was small, there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China, and there were unanswered questions about the virus's severity and transmissibility, he said. The committee recommended meeting again in 10 days.
"That was the mistake right there: It put them in the worst of all possible worlds," said David Fidler, an expert on global health at the Council on Foreign Relations who has been a consultant for the WHO and is on a roster of experts who can be asked to join one of its emergency committees, but was not in this case. "It looks like they dragged their feet."
On Jan. 23, there were 581 confirmed cases in China and 10 abroad. Dr. Tedros flew to China and met with Mr. Xi on Jan. 28. By then, there were 4,537 confirmed cases in China, and 56 internationally.
He said he wanted to use the time before the next emergency committee meeting to get more information.
The rapid increase in cases, signs that the virus was easily transmissible, and China's quarantine convinced the U.S. government to act.
By Jan. 25, the U.S. was making plans to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan. On Jan. 26, the CDC warned Americans to avoid nonessential travel to Hubei province and the next day extended that warning to all of China. The U.S. government then warned against all travel to China and banned most foreign nationals who had just been to China from entry.
At their Jan. 28 meeting, Dr. Tedros gave Mr. Xi personal credit for his efforts to tackle the crisis, and complimented the Chinese government's transparency.
After he arrived back in Geneva the next morning, Dr. Tedros called the emergency committee to reconvene. It met exactly a week after its last meeting. This time it recommended declaring an emergency.
Dr. Tedros agreed. Human-to-human transmission had been detected in three countries outside China, and he was concerned the virus would spread elsewhere, particularly in countries with weak health systems.
The WHO is raising funds and helping those countries prepare for possible cases, he said. "Even now there's a window of opportunity," he said. "The number of cases elsewhere in the world is still small."

A plan to roll out coronavirus testing kits to public health laboratories in the U.S. has hit a snag.
Some of the labs validating the Centers for Disease Control test got inconclusive results when running it themselves, the CDC said on Wednesday. The inconclusive results were part of a test run, and weren't used on actual patient samples.
The likely culprit is a reagent, or chemical substance, used in the test that isn't behaving consistently, authorities said, and the CDC is working to remanufacture the substance.
The test is often run with a control reaction that is supposed to demonstrate a negative result and make sure the test is running properly. But for some labs, that negative reaction ended up showing a small signal, implying there was some sort of contamination and that results would be invalid, said Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious diseases at the Association of Public Health Laboratories.
Also Wednesday, the CDC said a second person under federal quarantine in San Diego tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the number of confirmed U.S. cases in the global outbreak to 14.
The two patients, both at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, were passengers who arrived on separate planes from China, and health authorities say they have no links.
"At this time, there is no indication of person-to-person spread of this virus at the quarantine facility," CDC on-site team leader Chris Braden said.
The CDC said there are likely to be more confirmed cases in the coming days and weeks. More than 600 people who recently returned from Hubei province on chartered flights are under federal quarantine.

The coronavirus outbreak originating in China that has weighed on demand for crude oil, copper and soybeans is prompting a rally in some niche commodities markets.
For raw materials including thermal coal, which is burned to generate electricity, or alloys of vanadium and molybdenum, used to toughen up steel, the drop in Chinese output has outweighed any decline in demand. The same goes for manganese, a specialty metal used by steelmakers as well as producers of fertilizer.
The prices of these commodities have climbed as buyers in China and elsewhere try to secure supplies, underlining the country's complex position in the world economy as a major consumer, supplier and processor of raw materials.
China is scrambling to contain an illness that has led to more than 1,000 fatalities and infected over 45,000 people by imposing travel bans, urging people in some regions to stay home, and forcing stores and factories to curtail operations. Even as businesses in some parts resumed operations after an extended Lunar New Year holiday, many people remained stranded far from home.
The shortage of workers has stalled production at mines in China, squeezing supplies of thermal coal and lifting prices.
In the northern port of Qinhuangdao, where thermal coal is loaded onto boats and shipped down the coast to power companies as far south as Guangzhou, the price of the fossil fuel rose 3.8% in 2020 to $82.44 a metric ton as of Tuesday, according to S&P Global Platts. By contrast, Brent crude oil futures, the benchmark in energy markets, had dropped 18% through Tuesday as traders braced for a decline in Chinese fuel consumption.
Neighboring Mongolia might have imposed a ban on sending coal into China, according to Joe Aldina, head of coal analytics at Platts, which could be adding to the squeeze on supplies. Health checks on people, meanwhile, have slowed the flow of ships into Qinhuangdao.
Utility companies in the U.S. and Western Europe have slashed the amount of coal they burn in recent years, cementing China's position as the driving force behind global thermal-coal prices. Mr. Aldina expects the current rise in prices to be short-lived, as China's six largest utilities appear to have sufficient coal reserves so they won't rush to buy the fuel from other countries.
Prices have risen even further in smaller commodities markets where Chinese producers dominate global output. That includes ferrovanadium, an alloy of iron and vanadium used by steelmakers to improve resistance to heat and corrosion. Vanadium is also used by aircraft makers in jet engines when it is mixed with titanium and aluminum instead of iron.
China produced around 70% of the world's vanadium alloys in 2019, according to Timothy Wood-Dow, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. The spread of the coronavirus has knocked out around 40% of Chinese ferrovanadium production and pushed prices up world-wide.
A pound of ferrovanadium cost $13 in the U.S. last week, according to commodities consulting firm CRU Group, 20% more than at the start of the year. In Europe, ferrovanadium prices have jumped 26% to $28.70 a kilogram Tuesday.
"China supplies most of the global market," said Greg Smart, an analyst at CRU, adding that there were already some shortages of vanadium before the start of the coronavirus outbreak. "Most of it is produced in China, and as a result there's been quite a shock to the market."
The price of electrolytic-manganese metal -- used by makers of stainless and carbon steel, as well as some aluminum producers -- has jumped 26% to $2,087.50 a metric ton this year through Tuesday, according to CRU. China, which accounts for more than 90% of global electrolytic-manganese output, imports unrefined ore from countries including South Africa, Australia, Ghana and Gabon before processing it into refined metal.
Traders have struggled to transport manganese across China because of disruption in the trucking industry. Some traders in China have stopped offering quotes to customers, and some European importers have ceased placing orders due to worries the manganese won't be delivered on time.
"The problem is getting the material to the port," said Sebastian Kreft, co-founder of Metalshub, a trading platform for specialty metals. "There seems to be lots of logistics problems."

Stocks rose to records as concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak continued to ease.
The S&P 500 was propelled in part by companies whose shares had suffered as investors worried how the outbreak in China would affect global economic growth. The beaten-down energy sector posted the largest advance in the broad stock index, which was also pulled forward by gains among airlines, resorts and cruise companies.
All three major U.S. stock indexes closed at highs. The S&P 500 added 21.70 points, or 0.6%, to 3379.45, its 11th record close of 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 275.08 points, or 0.9%, to 29551.42, its seventh record of the year.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 87.02 points, or 0.9%, to 9725.96, its 13th such record.
The spread of the disease appears to be slowing, according to China's National Health Commission.
"The coronavirus is still the main narrative," said James Athey, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. The economic impact of the virus is unclear as figures for the first quarter haven't been released yet, he said. "The market is finding a way to consistently see the positive in everything in the absence of bad news."
As concern about the outbreak's effect on demand receded, Brent crude, the global benchmark for oil, gained 3.3% to settle at $55.79 a barrel. The energy sector, the S&P 500's weakest-performing group this year, rose 1.4%.
Companies that have seen their share prices fall amid concerns about the outbreak gained ground. Shares of Royal Caribbean Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and Carnival each rose more than 2.5%. Airline shares also ticked upward, with United Airlines Holdings and American Airlines Group adding more than 2%.
"Today the rally is led by the laggards," said Olivier Sarfati, head of equities at GenTrust.
U.S. stock indexes have shaken off headwinds this year to reach highs even after a major rally in 2019. Investors say equities could still have room to run.
"The market can continue to move higher because of recovering earnings growth, stable economic growth and a friendly monetary environment," said Nancy Perez, senior portfolio manager at Boston Private.
With about 70% of S&P 500 companies having reported, analysts expect earnings to log an increase of 0.8% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to FactSet.
Investors watched Tuesday and Wednesday as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testified before Congress. On Tuesday, Mr. Powell said the U.S. central bank is monitoring disruption from the coronavirus and focusing on effects on the U.S. economy. He said it was too early to tell if the outbreak would change the Fed's view that interest rates are at an appropriate level.
Among individual stocks, Bed Bath &Beyond fell $3.06, or 21%, to $11.79 after the home-goods retailer said sales declined in December and January. Lyft dropped $5.48, or 10%, to $48.46 after the ride-hailing company said it doesn't expect to turn a profit until the end of 2021.
Shopify, meanwhile, rallied $38.50, or 7.8%, to $531.25 after its revenue outlook was unexpectedly positive.

Oil Hedges Likely Added To Outbreak-Led Plunge

A scramble by Wall Street to reduce exposure to falling oil prices may have hastened crude's recent descent.
In just 19 days during January, crude prices tumbled 20% from their recent peak. That was the fastest slide into a bear market since early 2016, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
Analysts blame the slide on fears the coronavirus would hit the global economy and weaken demand for oil. The speed of the decline also suggests it was fueled by big banks making bets designed to hedge deals with oil companies, some traders said.
Oil companies expect to produce a certain amount of crude at future dates and want to protect themselves from price swings. They do so by buying financial instruments that typically give them the right to sell an amount of crude at a prearranged price, known as the strike, within a given time frame.
If the price of oil heads toward that strike price, the banks and other financial institutions on the other side of the trade need to protect themselves against losses. These firms do this using another set of financial instruments, but those trades can put further downward pressure on the price of oil.
For instance, banks may have felt compelled to sell crude futures in January as prices slid toward the strike price, said Robert Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA. For U.S. crude, $50 tends to be a popular strike price, he said.
Such trades help institutional traders and banks mitigate the risk associated with oil-price swings. But traders say they can also amplify price movements, especially when a lot of firms start making them.
"You end up with this situation where the price is going down because people are worried about falling demand due to the coronavirus," said energy economist Philip Verleger. "Then, on top of that, you have these financial institutions that have written these hedges coming and selling more futures."
While such trades likely exacerbated crude's most recent fall, traders and analysts say the recent plunge was driven by supply-and-demand issues. Crude prices have edged up this week, with West Texas Intermediate futures gaining 1.7% to settle at $51.17 a barrel on Wednesday. Brent, the global gauge of prices, has advanced 2.4%, settling at $55.79 a barrel Wednesday.
Producers have promised restraint amid a global crude glut, but investors still doubt oil prices will rise. During the week ended Feb. 4, hedge funds and other speculative investors cut net bets on higher U.S. crude prices to their lowest since November.
Slumping oil prices have hurt shares of energy companies recently. Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp. both fell around 11% in January.
And now the coronavirus is hitting oil demand. The Chinese government has closed off the hardest-hit cities and several countries have advised citizens against nonessential travel to China.

S&amp;P, Nasdaq Gain, as Dow Slips

The S&P 500 ticked higher, with investors weighing the latest developments on the coronavirus outbreak and digesting markets-friendly comments from the Federal Reserve chairman.
The broad stock-market index rose 5.66 points, or 0.2%, to 3357.75, while the Nasdaq Composite added 10.55 points, or 0.1%, to 9638.94. Both indexes set records for the second consecutive session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.48 point, or less than 0.1%, to 29276.34.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony that the central bank is monitoring the potential for global economic disruptions from the coronavirus in China.
While "some of the uncertainties around trade have diminished recently," the viral outbreak "could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy," Mr. Powell said in prepared remarks before the House Financial Services Committee.
Edward Moya, senior market analyst at brokerage Oanda, said the biggest factor for investors is confidence that the Fed will step in to support the economy if needed.
"Until the Fed starts to tighten" -- something nobody expects -- "it's green lights and go time," he said.
The Dow was weighed down by several stocks. Shares of Microsoft and Apple were hit by news the Federal Trade Commission was expanding its antitrust probe into tech companies.
Microsoft fell $4.26, or 2.3%, to $184.44. Apple lost $1.94, or 0.6%, to $319.61.
Investors continue to grapple with conflicting signals surrounding the virus outbreak.
Although concerns about the widespread transmission of the virus to other countries including the U.S. and U.K. remain, the number of confirmed infections showed the smallest one-day increase since Jan. 24.
"The rate of infection seems to be slowing," said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for EMEA at State Street Global Advisors.
He said he wasn't tracking the total number of infections, "but the rate, the speed at which the disease is spreading, and that seems to be topping out."
In addition, investors are "fully convinced that the Chinese government will step in to do, to quote Mario Draghi, whatever it takes" to support the domestic economy, Mr. Kassam said.
Some traders worried that the Chinese government could be undercounting cases, said Art Cashin, head of UBS's floor operations at the New York Stock Exchange, which he said contributed to some selling.
The potential economic fallout from the disease and efforts to stop the virus from spreading remains a concern. The death toll has surpassed 1,000 and businesses have been slow to resume operations following the extended Lunar New Year holiday, even after some local governments stopped calling for people to stay away from the workplace.
Among individual stocks, shares of Sprint surged $3.72, or 78%, to $8.52 after a federal judge approved the company's merger with T-Mobile. The decision clears the way for the No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers by subscribers to combine, overcoming an antitrust challenge. T-Mobile shares rose $9.96, or 12%, to $94.49.
The news weighed on competitors Verizon Communications, which fell $1.55, or 2.6%, to $58.69, and AT&T, which dropped 17 cents, or 0.4%, to $38.17.
Under Armour shares dropped $3.86, or 19%, to $16.59 after the sportswear company reported a loss for the holiday quarter and said U.S. sales would fall in 2020.
Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.9%, hitting a record.
At midday Tuesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei was up 0.5%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was also up 0.5% and the Shanghai Composite was down 0.2%.

Treasury Yields Turn Higher

U.S. government-bond yields rose as concerns around the coronavirus abated, stocks edged higher and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is monitoring the potential global economic disruptions from the virus.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.589%, according to Tradeweb, compared with 1.547% Monday.
Investors often buy Treasurys, whose prices rise as yields fall, when they are seeking safety during market turbulence or economic uncertainty. When concerns subside, they usually allocate capital back into higher-yielding assets such as stocks or junk bonds.
The move in the 10-year yield snapped a three-day slide. Some traders said it indicates the worst of the coronavirus may be priced into government bonds. The Chinese government encouraged people to resume work after an extended Lunar New Year holiday and some plants resumed manufacturing.
Mr. Powell, who testified before the House Financial Services Committee, said the U.S. economy was in a very good place.
He said the central bank is y monitoring the potential impact of the virus on the global economy.
Mr. Powell is set to testify again Wednesday before the Senate Banking Committee.
Analysts and traders expect Treasury yields will trade within a limited range in 2020 as the Fed remains on hold for an extended period and provides liquidity to financial markets.
They also expect inflation to hover below the central bank's target of 2%, limiting the risk the central bank tightens monetary policy.
Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed-income at BlackRock Inc., expects the yield on the 10-year Treasury will stay between 1.50% and 2.25% during the year, but that the coronavirus and the corresponding growth risk could keep the range lower for a period.
Some analysts warn that investors shouldn't underestimate the virus's effect on global supply chains, which could further pressure some currencies and boost the dollar. The WSJ Dollar Index rose 0.1% to 91.45 on Tuesday and is up 2.2% this year.

WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is closely monitoring the extent of global economic disruptions from the coronavirus in China, singling out a risk that has made officials more likely to lower interest rates than to raise them.
"We'll be watching this carefully," Mr. Powell said Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee. "The question for us really is what will be the effects on the U.S. economy? Will they be persistent? Will they be material? That's really the question."
Mr. Powell said it was too soon to say whether the outbreak would change the central bank's view that the current level of short-term rates remains appropriate to support solid economic growth and hiring. "There's no way to be confident about anyone's assessment, and there are a range of assessments," he said.
No sooner had the U.S. and China signed a trade truce last month than the coronavirus outbreak rekindled doubts about the global economy's prospects in 2020.
"We find the U.S. economy in a very good place, performing well," Mr. Powell said. "We see signs of global growth bottoming out." He is set to testify Wednesday before the Senate Banking Committee.
President Trump has frequently criticized the Fed for not doing more to lower rates to weaken the relative value of the dollar, which could boost exports. Mr. Trump repeated his frustration around 90 minutes into Tuesday's hearing.
"When Jerome Powell started his testimony today, the Dow was up 125, &heading higher. As he spoke it drifted steadily downward, as usual, and is now at -15," Mr. Trump said in a tweet. "Fed Rate is too high." Stocks gained ground in the second half of the three-hour hearing.
Central banks moved aggressively last year to provide stimulus to cushion the global economy against a growth slowdown amplified by trade tensions. Fed officials cut their benchmark federal-funds rate three times in 2019, to a range between 1.5% and 1.75%, after raising it four times in 2018.
Mr. Powell said the Fed had held rates steady and signaled a wait-and-see posture at its most recent meetings in December and January because some uncertainties surrounding trade had diminished and because there were "some signs that global growth may be stabilizing," Mr. Powell said.
Mr. Powell repeated the Fed's recent wait-and-see policy guidance, in which the current level of rates "will likely remain appropriate" as long as the economy continued to perform in line with projections for steady growth. "Of course, policy is not on a preset course," he said. "If developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly."
China serves as the hub of global supply chains for numerous products, including cars and computer chips. Beijing has imposed quarantines that have idled factories, while air travel to the country has been curtailed. Stock markets paused after racing to records last month, and bond yields have slid, reflecting uncertainty about whether the Fed might adjust rates if the epidemic isn't quickly contained.
The Fed's semiannual report to Congress, released Friday, repeatedly highlighted the potential growth headwinds from the coronavirus and cited fragilities in China's corporate and financial sector.
"Because of the size of the Chinese economy, significant distress in China could spill over to U.S. and global markets through a retrenchment of risk appetite, U.S. dollar appreciation and declines in trade and commodity prices," the report said.
Fed officials grew especially sensitive to global developments last year in part because weaker inflation abroad has made it much harder for the central bank to keep U.S. inflation at its 2% goal.

Gold prices fell, staying below a recent peak hit in late January, with some analysts expecting confidence in the U.S. economy to limit demand for the haven asset.
Front-month gold futures for February delivery fell 0.6% to $1,565.60 a troy ounce on the Comex Division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, dropping 1.1% below a nearly seven-year high hit late last month. Prices have surged since last summer, with investors seeking to hedge against a stock-market downturn and lower bond yields globally making gold more attractive.
Lower yields support gold by making it less likely investors will miss out on outsize returns by owning bonds rather than gold as a haven.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell last week to its lowest level since early October, with investors worried the fallout from the coronavirus will slow global growth. Bond yields fall as prices rise.
The 10-year yield rose to 1.589% Tuesday, up from its recent low of 1.520% and from Monday's close of 1.547%.
Some investors expect yields to extend their rebound, with authorities taking steps to contain the coronavirus and U.S. economic data continuing to show sturdy growth.
January hiring figures released last week showed employers added 225,000 jobs in the first month of 2020, the latest example of strength in the labor market.
Analysts are looking ahead to data this week on inflation, retail sales and industrial production, with more upbeat economic figures potentially dimming gold's allure.
Another reason that strong U.S. economic data hurt gold is they often boost the dollar. A stronger dollar makes commodities denominated in the U.S. currency more expensive for overseas buyers.
The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 other currencies, rose Monday for the 11th time in 13 trading days with investors favoring assets more tied to the U.S. It edged lower on Tuesday.
Hedge funds and other speculative investors have already pared back bullish gold bets.
They cut net bets on higher bullion prices to their lowest level in nearly two months during the week ended Feb. 4, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
Figures for the week ended Tuesday will be released on Friday.
Elsewhere in commodities, U.S. crude-oil futures rebounded 0.7% to $49.94 a barrel, stabilizing after closing at a 13-month low on Monday with analysts projecting excess supply. The coronavirus has dented fuel demand in Asia, sending oil prices into a bear market recently down more than 20% from a peak hit in early January.
On Tuesday, Brent crude, the global gauge of prices, added 1.4% to $54.01 a barrel.

SAN DIEGO -- A passenger flown on a U.S. government-chartered flight out of Wuhan, China, became the first evacuee to test positive for the coronavirus.
The woman, who arrived in San Diego on a flight to a military base there tested positive after developing a cough and being taken to a hospital.
Tests didn't initially confirm a coronavirus infection, so she was returned to the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station, where evacuees are being quarantined for 14 days, said Christopher Braden, deputy director for emerging and zoonotic diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The patient was hospitalized at UC San Diego Health when the test came back positive, he said.
According to the CDC, the lab samples sent to Atlanta for testing were mislabeled, resulting in an negative report from incorrect samples.
In addition to the woman in quarantine in San Diego, the U.S. has 12 other confirmed coronavirus cases.
The U.S. State Department has evacuated more than 800 people from Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, housing them in hotels on military bases for the 14-day quarantine period.
Despite the initial erroneous test result, Mr. Braden said, the quarantine and health screenings were effective in keeping the rest of the residents safe from infection.

FEDERAL RESERVEPowell: Coronavirus a risk to global economy
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell said the U.S. central bank is keeping a close eye on fallout from the deadly coronavirus outbreak in China, singling it out among risks threatening the U.S. and world economies. 
'In particular, we are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy,' Powell said in remarks before U.S. lawmakers Tuesday.
Powell stopped short of saying the outbreak had changed the Fed's baseline outlook for the U.S. economy or the expectation among many members of the Federal Open Market Committee that rates will remain on hold this year.
Powell faced questions from lawmakers of the House Financial Services Committee about the potential impact of the virus on the U.S. economy.
'We know that there will be some, very likely be some effects on the United States,' he said, adding that the question for the Fed is whether they will be 'persistent' and 'material.'
The Fed chief is scheduled for a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee at 10 a.m. Wednesday as part of his semiannual testimony to Congress.

AIRLINE INDUSTRYNo commercial planes sold by Boeing in Jan.
Boeing failed to sell any commercial planes in January, extending a slump that has strained the company's finances since two deadly crashes grounded the 737 Max last year.
Last month was Boeing's second with no orders since the Max flying ban began in March, according to data posted Tuesday on the company's website. The Chicago-based manufacturer also came up empty in May 2019.
Deliveries were also lackluster. While January typically is a slow month for plane makers, Boeing shipped only 13 jets last month, down from 46 a year earlier.
Boeing has been losing ground to European rival Airbus SE as the U.S. titan works with regulators to clear the Max to resume commercial service, a process the company expects to complete by midyear.
" Bloomberg News
HOUSEHOLD DEBTU.S. borrowing jumped in 4th quarter
Americans increased their borrowing for the 22nd straight quarter as more households took out loans to buy homes or refinance existing mortgages, according to a report released Tuesday from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Total U.S. household debt rose by $601-billion in the fourth quarter, or 1.4 percent, surpassing $14 trillion for the first time, the New York Fed's quarterly household credit and debt report showed. That is $1.5 trillion above the previous peak in the third quarter of 2008. Overall household debt is now 26.8-percent above the second-quarter 2013 trough.

Also in Business 
U.S. job openings unexpectedly slumped, falling to a two-year low in December, which could reflect weaker demand for hiring as an increasing share of the population joins the workforce. The number of available positions decreased by 364,000 to 6.42-million, according to the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, released Tuesday. That compares to the median forecast for a modest gain to 6.93-million. The quits rate held at 2.3-percent for a fourth month.
Wells Fargo chief executive Charles Scharf announced his first major reshuffle on Tuesday, promoting several executives to new roles. The consumer bank will be split into a consumer lending division and a retail banking division, and the wholesale bank will be split into a commercial banking unit and a corporate and investment banking unit.
WeWork on Tuesday brought forward its target of becoming free cash flow positive by a year to 2022 as Chairman Marcelo Claure pushes ahead with his five-year turnaround plan aimed at boosting valuation and winning back investor trust. The office-sharing start-up, which has gone through a meltdown as its public offering imploded last year, also said it expects to record its first $1-billion revenue quarter this year.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is urging governments to get more involved in supporting the tepid euro-zone economy through targeted spending and business-friendly reforms. Lagarde said 'other policy areas . . . have to play their part.' The remarks to the European Parliament on Tuesday played into a debate on the bank's record-low interest rates and money-printing bond purchases, which have been criticized in Germany for their impact on savers and potential role in inflating asset prices. 
Air Italy investors Qatar Airways and the Aga Khan Fund decided to put the struggling carrier into liquidation, citing 'persistent and structural conditions' in the market. Shareholders of the two-year-old airline acted unanimously, and the Italian carrier will guarantee flights scheduled through Feb. 25 by other operators, Air Italy said Tuesday in a statement.

Gold Edges Lower With Investors Eyeing Economic Data; More upbeat economic figures could come later this week, potentially dimming gold's allure

Gold prices fell Tuesday, staying below a recent peak hit in late January with some analysts expecting confidence in the U.S. economy to limit demand for the safe-haven metal.
Front-month gold futures for February delivery fell 0.6% to $1,565.60 a troy ounce on the Comex Division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, dropping 1.1% below a nearly seven-year high hit late last month. Prices have surged since last summer, with investors seeking to hedge against a stock-market downturn, and lower bond yields globally making gold more attractive to investors.

On Tuesday, Brent crude, the global gauge of prices, added 1.4% to $54.01 a barrel.

An international housewares show scheduled to take place in Chicago next month is scrapping part of the event because of travel limitations tied to the coronavirus from China. 
The Inspired Home Show will not include an International Sourcing Expo, which was to include dishes, flatware and other household products made by 500 Chinese companies, said Leana Salamah, the International Housewares Association's vice president of marketing. The Rosemont-based trade group consulted with Chinese organizers and exhibitors and decided to cancel the expo, Salamah said.
"They are factories that are sponsored by the Chinese government... With those Chinese factories, the challenge is that they can't get here," Salamah said.
On Jan. 31, the Trump administration declared coronavirus a public health emergency, temporarily suspending entry into the country by most travelers arriving from China or those who have recently visited China. There have been more than 40,500 confirmed coronavirus cases globally, and the disease has killed 910 people, all but one in China, according to a Monday report by the World Health Organization.
More than 1,700 exhibitors are expected to attend the trade-only show at McCormick Place Convention Center March 14-17, Salamah said. The International Sourcing Expo tends to be the least visited of the expos, but the effect of not having it "remains to be seen," she said.
The association also is warning attendees coming from China they may be denied entry into the U.S.
The coronavirus has gripped the global economy, causing airlines to suspend flights to China and disrupting production facilities.
Other international trade shows are being affected as well. Sony and Amazon were among some of the tech companies that pulled out of the Mobile World Congress, a mobile industry trade fair, in Barcelona, Spain, this month.

World News: Wuhan Evacuees Brace for Weekslong U.S. Quarantine

Tennessee resident David Mayes was in China visiting his girlfriend in Wuhan when officials locked down the city on Jan. 23, aiming to stop a rapidly spreading coronavirus that has killed hundreds there.
Overnight, the city turned into a ghost town, Mr. Mayes said. Eight-lane highways were empty. Businesses were shuttered. But some Americans have made it out, on flights chartered by the U.S. State Department from an otherwise-closed airport.
Mr. Mayes, a 59-year-old pilot, waited at the airport for 15 hours as passengers were screened for fever. When they departed, he found out he was headed for a two-week quarantine on Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, a base near San Diego.
After landing and undergoing a health check, Mr. Mayes was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he spent four days in isolation, watching Netflix and waiting for test results to tell him whether he has the virus. Sunday, his results came back negative, Mr. Mayes said. He was headed to the base for the rest of the quarantine period.
The virus has sickened some 40,000 people, with more than 30,000 cases just in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, and killed more than 1,000. Twelve in the U.S. have been confirmed to have the novel coronavirus, all of them recent travelers to China or their family members.
China's shutdown of Wuhan, a city larger than New York, was unprecedented. So has been the evacuation and quarantine of hundreds of Americans over the past week, who now face mandatory 14-day stays in military hotels.
"It has been over 60 years since we issued a federal quarantine like this. The last one was during the smallpox era," said Jennifer McQuiston, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deputy director of high consequence pathogens and pathology.
At least five military bases in California, Colorado, Texas and Nebraska have prepared to receive passengers from Wuhan. Evacuees are housed in on-base hotels, separated from the rest of the base, Dr. McQuiston said. Those quarantined pass time watching television, playing games or working remotely. Their temperatures are monitored and anyone showing symptoms is whisked to a hospital.
U.S. citizens are expected to cover the costs of the operation. Prospective passengers were told that the flight alone would total about $1,000 and that other fees might apply.
A CDC spokeswoman didn't respond to messages asking how many of the evacuees from the U.S. flights from Wuhan had been taken to hospitals with possible symptoms. None of the evacuees have been publicly declared to have the virus.
Jin Geun Lim, 23, became stranded in Wuhan on a trip from Connecticut to meet his in-laws. Late for his second semester at the University of Bridgeport, he was making plans to find work in China when he found out on Feb. 3 that he could leave on a chartered evacuation flight, he said. The drive to the airport was the first time he had left the family's two-bedroom apartment in 15 days.
Mr. Lim had to leave his wife, who doesn't yet have her green card. She had to find a temporary design job in China. Mr. Lim's mother-in-law was crying as he left them at the airport, he said. On the flight, a woman collapsed and was taken to a hospital as the rest of the group was quarantined at Travis Air Force Base, near Vacaville, Calif.
As of Friday, 12 passengers from commercial flights who had recently traveled to Hubei province had been subject to a federal quarantine, isolated at home or in hotels, private housing or federal facilities.
U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have recently traveled to mainland China have been asked to stay home for up to 14 days, check their temperatures twice a day, limit social contact and check in with local health departments.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose to records as investors focused on signs of strength in the economy.
For the S&P 500, it was the ninth record close of 2020, rising 24.38 points, or 0.7%, to 3352.09. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite notched its 11th record of the year, adding 107.88 points, or 1.1%, to 9628.39.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 174.31 points, or 0.6%, to 29276.82, nearing the record high it reached last week.
Monday's advances came after major U.S. indexes posted their biggest weekly gains in months, as stronger-than-expected corporate earnings and employment data outweighed fears that the coronavirus outbreak in China could drag down global economic growth.
The jobs report Friday showed U.S. hiring strengthened in January as more Americans joined the labor market, a positive sign for the economy at the start of 2020.
"It's really a tug of war between good solid earnings growth, employment prospects in the United States versus the China issue related to the coronavirus," said Joe Quinlan, head of CIO Market Strategy for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank. "The two largest economies in the world, they're tacking in different directions in the near term."
The growth of new cases could accelerate further, the World Health Organization warned, even as officials across the world try to quarantine people to contain the spread.
The degree to which equity markets have been driven by concern about the impact of the coronavirus has ebbed and flowed in recent weeks, leading to increased volatility.
Before Monday, the S&P 500 had jumped or fallen more than 1% in five of the past 10 trading sessions, after previously not moving that much on a single day since October.
The broad stock index dropped 3.1% between Jan. 17 and Jan. 31 but has since returned to record territory.
"I think there's a major shift in investors' mind-set, that you buy into weakness, you don't sell into weakness, and that's causing the pullbacks to be muted," said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager atMorgan Stanley Investment Management.
Microsoft rose $4.81, or 2.6%, to $188.70, closing above $1.4 trillion in market value for the first time and regaining the title of largest U.S. company by market capitalization, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Apple had held that position since Oct. 31, 2019.
Electric-car maker Tesla, whose stock has been on a tear in recent days, gained $23.21, or 3.1%, to $771.28. Betting that the stock would fall has cost investors $8.4 billion since January.
As earnings season continued, shares of CNA Financial jumped $3.96, or 8.5%, to $50.81 after the insurance company beat expectations for earnings.
Shares of Restaurant Brands International gained $1.75, or 2.7%, to $65.61 after the fast-food company reported revenue and earnings ahead of projections.
Companies scheduled to report Tuesday include Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Lyft and Under Armour.
Analysts expect S&P 500 earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019 to register modest growth from a year earlier.
Investors will listen Tuesday as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell begins two days of testimony before Congress.
At their meeting last month, Fed officials held their benchmark interest rate steady and maintained their wait-and-see policy stance.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury dropped to 1.547% from 1.578% Friday. Bond yields fall as prices rise.
Overseas Monday, the Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.1%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed down 0.6%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.6%, the Shanghai Composite rose 0.5% and South Korea's Kospi lost 0.5%.
Early Tuesday, the Hang Seng was up 1.2%, the Shanghai benchmark was up 0.2% and the Kospi was up 1.3%. Japan's stock market was closed for Founders Day holiday.

Currencies: Australian Dollar Sinks on Slowdown Fears

SYDNEY -- Currencies of countries that have their economic wagons hitched to China have taken a sharp hit in recent weeks, with the Australian dollar reaching its lowest point in over a decade Monday.
Reflecting growing concerns about the damage the new coronavirus will do to China's economy, and especially its appetite for commodities like iron ore and copper, Australia's currency traded for as little as 66.7 U.S. cents Friday before rebounding a bit Monday. That was its weakest since March 2009, when Australia's economy was slowing dramatically as the global financial crisis unfolded in the months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. It has dropped 4.7% against the U.S. currency this year.
Concerns about a potential slowdown in China have weighed on the prices of crude oil and metals such as copper and aluminum. That's also soured the outlook for commodity currencies, or currencies from countries that supply those products to China and the rest of the world. These include Australia, Norway, Canada and New Zealand, as well as emerging markets such as South Africa, Russia and Brazil.
"It's not the virus itself causing the economic damage, but the efforts to contain it," said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics. While the immediate impact is most seen in energy demand, prolonged factory closures could have a spillover effect on construction and spending, weakening demand for commodities, he said.
Flights into and within China have been restricted by authorities to stem the contagion, leading to a drop in the use of jet fuel. The world's biggest oil importer has also extended a shutdown of business operations and trade, hurting demand for energy that would be used for the transport of goods.
That has weighed on the currencies on two oil-exporting nations: The Norwegian krone has declined 5.5% this year, while the Canadian dollar is down 2.5% this year.
Around one-third of all Australian exports go to China, and the Aussie dollar is heavily traded globally, making it a convenient way for many investors to express their views on China. That has helped make it one of the worst-performing currencies this year.
The Australian dollar is bearing the brunt of investor concerns about China's likely slowdown, said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital. "It makes sense because Australia is the developed country most exposed to China through the potential hit to commodity demand, tourism and education demand," he said.
An escalating coronavirus outbreak could see the Australian dollar hit 60 U.S. cents or lower in the coming weeks, given the heightened risk for a global and Australian recession, Mr. Oliver added. At the end of 2019, one Australian dollar bought just over 70 U.S. cents.
However, Ray Attrill, the head of global currency strategy at National Australia Bank, said the currency was already weaker than could be justified by the coronavirus epidemic.
Before the virus erupted into an international public-health issue, Australia was already grappling with homegrown challenges, including the effects of a devastating series of summer wildfires. Heavy rains over the weekend extinguished many of the fires.
Yields on 10-year Australian debt have roughly halved in a year, from more than 2% to about 1%, indicating investors expect slower growth and lower interest rates. Lower yields typically depress a currency's value.
The drop in the Australian dollar will help support exporters, acting like an interest-rate cut. Mr. Oliver said the depreciation was to some extent good news for the country's central bank. "It's a de facto monetary easing at a time of a significant threat to Australian economic growth," he said.
The Reserve Bank of Australia recently signaled it is in no hurry to further lower interest rates. The central bank's governor, Philip Lowe, last week pointed to the potential for distorted investment decisions and overheated asset prices if the cost of borrowing falls further.
New Zealand is also vulnerable to China, its largest trading partner in goods. Its currency has dropped 5.1% this year against the U.S. dollar. Both the Australian and New Zealand currencies are likely to face setbacks in the first half as regional economic performance may be curtailed in the coming quarters, according to Francesco Pesole, a foreign-exchange strategist at ING Bank. Going into the new year, his firm had expected both to outperform Group of 10 currencies.
The decline in currencies in recent weeks in response to the coronavirus is overdone, said Ilan Solot, global currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
Meanwhile, the newfound uncertainty in currency markets is likely to keep traders on edge. "It just kind of wakes them up to volatility," Mr. Solot said.

Businesses in China Struggle to Reopen

Business was slow to restart in China, even after some local governments stopped calling for people to stay away from the workplace during a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 1,000 people in the country and dented economic growth.
Workers remained stranded on Monday, unable to reach their factories. Office towers stayed dark as companies asked employees to work from home. In the few open stores in deserted malls, bored clerks played smartphone games.
"None of the workers are able to come back for work," said Luo Xiaoying, who owns a motorcycle-muffler factory in southern China's Guangdong province. "Our production has been suspended for almost a month now, and we don't know how long this will last."
The move to resume business operations came as President Xi Jinping of China paid his first public visit to the front lines of the outbreak, stopping at a Beijing hospital treating infected patients and at a local disease-control office after weeks of remaining largely out of public view.
He acknowledged that some medical workers had "sacrificed their lives," an apparent indirect reference to a young Wuhan doctor, Li Wenliang, whose death last week triggered an emotional response across the country, much of it frustration directed at officials.
The number of confirmed infections from the virus known as 2019-nCoV rose to 42,638 in China at the end of Monday, with 1,016 deaths, according to China's National Health Commission. There were 319 cases and two deaths outside mainland China. Confirmed cases in the U.S. remained at 12, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
The health commission reported a single-day high of 108 deaths in mainland China on Monday from the virus.
The quarantine of nearly 60 million people in Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, the center of the epidemic, means that workers who visited family there over the recent Lunar New Year holiday can't get back to their jobs. Even districts in cities hundreds of miles away such as Hangzhou, home to online retail giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., have confined residents to their homes to try to stop the spread of the virus.
On top of that, many companies continued to encourage people to continue working from home, even after Shanghai and Beijing officially ended their stay-away-from-the-workplace policy at midnight Sunday.
These conditions have created a ghost-town ambience across China, where closed and short-staffed businesses have hammered the economy. S&P Global Ratings on Friday said it had lowered its estimate for China's 2020 gross domestic product growth to 5% from 5.7%.
Accounting for nearly 30% of China's gross domestic product is the manufacturing sector. Many factories closed for the Lunar New Year holiday in late January and were set to reopen Monday, only to find a lack of workers and disrupted supply chains.
Ms. Luo's muffler plant is in a Guangdong district where local authorities require manufacturers to meet stringent safety requirements to resume work. To reopen, factories must guarantee that workers are coronavirus-free, which potentially means quarantining them for 14 days, and must provide them with protective gear such as masks, goggles and gloves that are hard to buy amid a nationwide shortage. Other areas in China have similar restrictions.
Even when her employees return, Ms. Luo is uncertain whether they can build or sell anything. Her suppliers and clients are also shut. "The whole supply chain is paralyzed," she said. She estimates she could reopen in April and resume full operations in May. "That means no income for almost half a year," she said.
Some bigger companies are reopening more quickly. Ford Motor Co. said it had resumed production at its plants in China on Monday, while General Motors Co. said it would resume production on Feb. 15.
Some Apple Inc. suppliers are likely to face further delays in restarting mass production, people familiar with the matter said. A challenge for them has been securing factory workers, because of nationwide travel restrictions and policies in certain cities restricting the entry of people from regions where the virus outbreak is severe, the people said.
Suppliers must also take measures to ensure the virus won't spread within their factories. Some suppliers are required by local governments to prepare enough masks, thermometers and disinfectants for workers, and secure space for quarantines in case workers get sick. Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.
Ms. Luo said her landlord had given her a grace period to pay rent, and her workers had been understanding about going unpaid during the shutdown.
Chinese officials have said the outbreak would increase soured loans. Officials at China's Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said last week that it would slash taxes and urged banks to offer leniency on mortgage and credit-card payments.
In Shanghai, where highway traffic remained sparse but still picked up noticeably from recent days, the municipal government said 70% of manufacturing companies had resumed business.
But a visit to the city's Songjiang factory district -- home to sites of 3M Co., Dow Inc., Foxconn Technology Group, Honda Motor Co., Quanta Computer Inc., Toto Ltd. and Tsingtao Brewery Co. -- suggested many factories were barely operational.
Most local restaurants were closed. The workers who did arrive at Songjiang's train station had their temperatures taken at screening areas.
They also received slips of paper that reminded them to wash their hands after using the toilet and instructed visitors to report if they have had a fever, cough, or shortness of breath, "especially if you have been in Hubei or in contact with patients from Hubei."
In Beijing, subways, which are usually standing room only, were mostly empty on Monday. So was China World, a usually packed Beijing office complex and shopping mall.
Li Guifang said he often sells more than 100 cups of juice a day at his Original Fresh storefront by an office-tower entrance, but by noon Monday he had sold only two cups -- to two journalists.

Trump proposes massive domestic spending cuts

EPA, safety-net programs Targeted 
Budget plan provides fuel for Democratic campaigns
The White House on Monday proposed a $4.8 trillion election-year budget that would slash major domestic and safety-net programs, setting up a stark contrast with President Trump's rivals as voting gets underway in the Democratic presidential primary.
The budget would pursue hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid and seek reductions in the Children's Health Insurance Program, while wringing some savings from Medicare despite Trump's repeated promises to safeguard the program for older Americans. 
The budget is a proposal to Congress, and lawmakers have mostly rejected the White House's proposed cuts in the past. Still, the budget plan sets up the Trump administration's policy priorities heading into the November election and is likely to draw scrutiny in Washington and on the campaign trail. Trump has in the past not shown much interest in pursuing the budget cuts his aides have offered, and he didn't make any public comments about the plan Monday.
Instead, one of his top advisers defended the proposed cuts, even as Democratic presidential candidates blasted the reductions.
Russell Vought, acting White House budget director, touted the proposed spending increases in the budget for NASA, immigration, opioid mitigation and veterans, while saying they would not lead to benefit reductions for Medicare and Medicaid, as Democrats charged. Vought also said the budget includes widespread cuts in federal waste that would bring down the deficit.
'We stand with families and businesses across the country who have to balance their budgets,' Vought told reporters. 'Washington, D.C., does not stand with them and for too long has operated under a different principle of recklessly spending other people's money. That has to change, and hopefully this budget will lead to it.'
A central theme of the new budget plan is its attempt to scale back domestic programs. It would slash the Environmental Protection Agency budget by 26.5 percent over the next year and cut the Department of Health and Human Services budget by 9 percent. HHS includes the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which would see a budget cut even as it is under intense scrutiny over its response to the coronavirus. Officials said the part of the CDC that responds to emergencies like the coronavirus would be protected.
'This is the future President Trump envisions for our nation,' said House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.). 'One where the federal government relinquishes any responsibility for the well-being of the American people in our nation. What the president has put forth is a destructive and irrational budget that intentionally goes after working families and vulnerable Americans.'
The plan would target the Education Department for a nearly 8-percent cut, and the Interior Department would be cut 13.4 percent. The State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development would be cut by 22 percent.
Trump has sought spending cuts in the past, only to back down immediately during negotiations with Democrats. For example, he has sought to cut numerous federal agencies multiple times and then reversed himself and approved budget increases. That's because Trump has pushed for huge increases in military spending, and Democrats have said they would go along with such changes only if Trump backed more money for housing, education and health care.
Proposing the cuts again, on the eve of the New Hampshire Democratic primary, gave Democrats a fresh target to attack.
'The old cliche is that a budget is a moral document,' Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said in a statement. 'What kind of unbelievable moral framework allowed this White House to propose $182 billion in cuts to nutrition assistance from needy families, when nearly one in seven households with children are food insecure?'
Trump did not defend any of the cuts in public. Over the weekend, he commented on the budget proposal just briefly, noting on Twitter that he would not touch Social Security or Medicare.
But even some of Trump's staunchest allies criticized his sharp cuts for domestic agencies, such as the Agriculture Department, which he is targeting for an 8 percent overall reduction. That was an indication that the budget will get a cold shoulder on Capitol Hill from lawmakers of both parties who will be responsible for writing spending bills into law that will actually fund the government when fiscal 2021 begins Oct.-1.
'I applaud the Administration for aiming to tackle the debt and deficit by addressing federal spending, but I do not support the disproportionate cuts to important agricultural programs,' Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said in a statement. 'The cuts proposed today would save little but inflict severe pain in American agriculture.'
Trump has made homelessness a key focus in the past year, but his budget would seek a big reduction in housing funds. He proposed an $8.6 billion cut for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a 15.2 percent decrease from the amount enacted for 2020. The cuts, as in previous years, include eliminating the four-decade-old Community Development Block Grant program popular among congressional Democrats and Republicans as well as affordable housing grants to states and municipalities to help with the construction, purchase or rental of homes.
The block grants, funds that Congress has restored in past budgets, provide cities with money for affordable housing and other community needs such as fighting blight, improving infrastructure and delivering food to homebound seniors. The administration, in its budget documents, said the program 'has not demonstrated sufficient impact.'
Housing advocates were not surprised by the proposed cuts because they were similar to past proposals and they urged Congress to reject them as it has largely done in the past. Advocates pointed to the flat funding of homeless assistance grants as a sign of the administration's lack of seriousness on ending homelessness, especially given Trump's recent focus on the housing crisis in California. The budget plan indicated that the administration will begin a new initiative to reduce street homelessness, targeting select cities, but provides no further details.
Parts of the budget, however, show how the White House has shifted in the face of political blowback from past plans. It would preserve, for example, a handful of politically sensitive programs that in some cases have provoked uproars and caused Trump to backpedal when he has tried to cut them in the past.
These include the Special Olympics and the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative " a program important to Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, critical states in the presidential election. Even as White House officials kept the Great Lakes fund steady, as they did for an ecosystem protection program in South Florida, similar programs in other, less politically important states are cut in the Trump budget.
The budget plan would also preserve State Department and Pentagon aid for Ukraine, something the White House tried to delay last year in a move that led to Trump's impeachment by the House of Representatives. However, the Ukraine portion of a State Department anti-corruption program called International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement would fall under the budget proposal, to $13 million from $30 million this year. Congress has rejected that proposed cut in the past.
Still, some agencies would be spared and even see a proposed increase.
Trump's new budget calls for an increase in funding for the Department of Homeland Security, while keeping Pentagon spending mostly flat. The NASA budget would increase by 12 percent with new money aimed at putting astronauts back on the Moon.
Even with all the other proposed spending cuts, the budget would fail to eliminate the federal deficit over the next 10 years, missing a longtime GOP fiscal target. Instead, White House officials said their budget proposal would close the deficit by 2035.
But it would only achieve this if the economy grows at an unprecedented, sustained 3 percent clip through 2025, levels the administration has failed to achieve for even one year so far. The U.S. economy grew 2.3 percent in 2019, the weakest level since Trump took office. Many economists say growth will remain sluggish this year.
Because the government spends much more money than it brings in, the Treasury Department must borrow the difference by issuing debt. The debt has grown by about $3 trillion since Trump took office, and the budget plan would add more than $5-trillion to it over the next decade. There is currently more than $20 trillion in government debt, something Trump had promised to eliminate by 2025 when running for office.
Trump's budget aims to cut spending on safety-net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, slashing spending on the latter by $181 billion over a decade. It proposes to squeeze hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare over a decade through cost-saving proposals such as reforming medical liability and modifying payments to hospitals for uncompensated care.
A senior administration official defended the Medicaid cut, noting that it reflects a decrease in the rate at which spending would grow rather than a reduction from current spending levels. The official said the administration would save money on Medicaid spending through new work requirements and recouping payments incorrectly spent by the federal government.
During the last year President Barack Obama was in office, the deficit was less than $600 billion, but it has grown significantly in subsequent years.
As part of the new budget plan, the White House would seek to make permanent parts of the 2017 tax cut that are set to expire after 2025. The budget says extending these tax cuts through the end of the decade would amount to a $1.4 trillion tax cut.

City's officials face crisis of confidence amid coronavirus outbreak
The looming new crisis came into view late last week, when an oddly large proportion of people on Hong Kong's streets could be seen clutching bags of toilet paper, sometimes supplemented with boxes of tissues. 
Curious, I toured my local grocery stores. Supplies of meat seemed to be flowing back in after a brief absence, and the vegetable aisle once again was a rainbow of color, as greens, carrots, peppers and other basics returned to shelves. I was cautiously optimistic that two weeks of panic-buying " on a scale unmatched even at the height of violent political unrest last year " might be petering out. 
A ride up the escalator to the dry goods and household products section revealed otherwise. With fears of the novel coronavirus gripping the city, a rumor of impending shortages circulating on social media had apparently spooked consumers, and pack after pack of toilet paper was flying off the shelves. Shoppers could barely carry the number of rolls they were snatching. By evening, not a single roll was left.
The panic stretched through the weekend. No more green-tea-scented toilet rolls, no more quilted plush rolls, no more jumbo rolls promising 'clean comfort' and an inviting picture of a fat Labrador puppy. Such scenes have played out citywide, documented in videos showcasing the frenzy. 
Staples such as rice have all but disappeared. And forget about hand soap, disinfectant, sanitizer or anything that brands itself 'antibacterial' " these have been almost impossible to find for weeks. Shoppers have stood in line in the thousands to obtain surgical masks, only to be turned away empty-handed.
Some are resorting to dramatic and costly measures to procure necessities. On a recent flight back from Myanmar, a woman from Hong Kong was traveling with just one piece of luggage stuffed with surgical masks. She explained to staff at the check-in counter, who were questioning why she had been in Myanmar for less than 24 hours, that she was simply on a supply run.
The idea of anyone flying to Myanmar from Hong Kong " which brands itself 'Asia's world city' " to obtain necessities is staggering. When I lived in Myanmar, also known as Burma, several years ago, the country was under U.S. sanctions. It was nearly impossible to get a SIM card, although these days, if you're lucky, you might find almond milk and sour cream.
Gloves have also been in short supply in Hong Kong, as people fearful of the coronavirus try to minimize direct hand exposure. At the grocery store, a woman had taken to covering her hands with plastic bags. At a subway station, a man was holding his phone in a zip-top bag.
The coronavirus outbreak, which started in China's Hubei province and has rapidly made its way around the world, has not spared Hong Kong. As of Sunday, the city had recorded 36 cases, including nine members of the same family who shared a hot-pot meal. But compounding the difficulties of the city's response is a widespread deficit of trust in the Hong Kong government " a commodity that is perhaps in even shorter supply than toilet paper. As one Bloomberg Opinion columnist put it: The semiautonomous financial hub, once known as a bastion of global trade and capitalism, is now showing signs of a failed state. 
The heightened anxiety over the coronavirus has followed months of political upheaval that battered Hong Kong's reputation as a stable base for international business. More than 7,000 people have been arrested since June, and it is hard to find Hong Kongers who have not tasted the sensation of inhaling tear gas. 
The Hong Kong government's response to the virus threat has reinforced a sense that it is incapable of handling the crisis, notwithstanding the city's experience during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 300 here. While officials have pledged to ensure adequate supplies, it's clear that few people are convinced.
Other jurisdictions took swift and sometimes dramatic measures to curtail the spread of the pneumonia-like virus. Singapore enlisted its armed forces to distribute masks to the public, dipping into its national stockpile. Taiwan implemented a rationing system for masks and imposed a flat fee on each, of about 2 cents, to prevent price gouging. Both those places have effectively closed their border to arrivals from mainland China. 
Even Macao, the semiautonomous Chinese territory known mostly as a gambling center, took drastic action to protect its people, shuttering its casinos, despite the certain hit to its economy.
In Hong Kong, by contrast, prices of masks have skyrocketed. Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive, has refused to close the border with mainland China, as demanded by striking medical workers.
Underpinning it all is the Hong Kong government's continuing challenge of legitimacy. The city's leadership is not directly elected but rather appointed by a 1,200-member committee, which picks from a handful of candidates prescreened by the Chinese Communist Party " a process designed to ensure that top officials are loyal to Beijing. A poll last month by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute found that just 19 percent of Hong Kong residents trust the city's government, with 69-percent saying they distrust the administration. 
With virus fears at fever pitch, civil society has effectively taken over some functions of government, creating infographics on how to effectively wash one's hands and wear surgical masks correctly. A group on the messaging app Telegram, the backbone of organization for the pro-democracy protests, has been set up to crowdsource and disseminate information on where masks are available. 
Meanwhile, protests continue. A crowd gathered this past weekend to commemorate a university student who died during demonstrations last year. When the protesters started to barricade roads, police swooped in and arrested more than 100, including five elected local representatives.
A well-placed former Hong Kong government official, on learning that I was from Singapore, told me during a recent conversation: 'You are lucky. At least your government has to win elections. Over here, no matter what they do, right or wrong, ultimately we all know they don't really answer to us.'

Economies similar under Obama and Trump " but optimism at 20-year high
Americans increasingly rate this as the best economy since the late 1990s, with a recent surge in optimism, even though many economic metrics show striking similarities to the final years of the Obama administration.
Fifty-nine percent of Americans say they are better off financially today than they were a year ago, the highest since 1999, according to a Gallup survey released last week. And nearly three-quarters predict they will do better a year from now, the most optimistic reading that Gallup's annual 'Mood of the Nation' survey has ever recorded.
Other polls and surveys aren't quite as ebullient, but nearly all show that Americans are far less worried about the economy and their personal financial situations than they were during the last presidential election.
Upbeat sentiment is critical for the U.S. economy because it motivates consumer spending, the most important driver of U.S. economic growth. And President Trump is counting on a strong economy to motivate voters to turn out at the polls and reelect him.
Bryan DeHenau runs a roofing business in Macomb County, Mich., just outside Detroit. Around the time of the last presidential election, he had enough jobs to keep one crew busy, but some of the gigs were barely profitable. Today he can keep three crews busy during the spring and summer months, and he has been able to raise prices, regularly giving people estimates of $20,000 to redo a roof and finding that 'they don't even bat an eye about it anymore.'
'I'm driving a brand-new 2019 Ford F-250. I've got work coming out the ying-yang. I'm doing okay,' DeHenau said. 'Four years ago, I couldn't sleep at night. That's a pretty big turnaround.'
Some of the biggest recent increases in consumer confidence have come from independent voters and less affluent households, according to Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. His team always asks people to explain why they feel confident, and, lately, they are hearing near-record levels of people saying their income and wealth are rising.
'We've only seen this many people mention income gains twice before: 1966 after the 1960s expansion and 2000 after the 1990s expansion,' Curtin said.
In interviews with six small-business owners across the country, all acknowledged that the economy had turned around under President Barack Obama, but they pointed out that several more years of steady growth, solid job gains and additional stock market records under Trump had turned 'cautious optimism' into full-blown optimism.
Business owners varied in how much credit they would give Trump personally, but all had examples of how they had more work than they could handle and were buying equipment and bringing on new people in ways that had not happened since before the Great Recession. Trump's approval rating on the economy hit an all-time high last month, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.
On Friday, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy added 225,000 jobs in January, beating forecasters' expectations and further dampening concerns about a recession. Many workers have also felt better off financially thanks to tax cuts, cheaper gas prices and minimum-wage increases in more than 20 states. Wage growth has inched up for rank-and-file workers in recent months, although it remains below the stellar levels of the late 1990s.
Economists say one of the biggest drivers of consumer confidence is job quantity. Confidence rises when people feel as if it is easy to get a job, even if it is not a high-paying one.
Job growth has slowed lately, averaging 182,000 a month under Trump vs. 220,000 a month in the 37 months at the end of Obama's tenure. But the health of the labor market is evident, with the unemployment rate near half-century lows at 3.6-percent. The nation has added more than 2-million jobs every year for the past nine years, an unprecedented streak of steady gains.
'Your chance of going to work tomorrow and getting laid off is lower than it's ever been going back to 1948,' said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. 'That feeling of job security is very important.'
DeHenau, 33, calls this the best economy of his working years. He voted for Obama and then Trump. He gives Obama credit for getting the upswing going, but he thinks the economy would not be as good as it is now without Trump.
'I give Trump 80 to 90-percent of the credit,' DeHenau said. 'Even under Obama when it was good, there was no profitability.'
There has been less praise for Trump in the manufacturing sector, which tumbled into a technical recession last year as the president's trade war drove up prices and hurt purchases from other parts of the world.
Jamison Scott, who runs a small manufacturing company in Woodbridge, Conn., remembers the ugly surprise he got after Trump enacted steel tariffs in March 2018 and steel prices soared about 20-percent.
Scott, who manufactures and distributes air ducts and says he uses American steel, was worried how his company could manage the extra cost " or even keep getting enough steel. One steel shipment he ordered that year showed up with about a quarter less material than what he requested.
But steel prices have come back down in recent months, a welcome relief for Scott, and his business from throughout the country has picked up. Enough cash has been coming in that he bought a new plasma cutter and seam welder, the types of big purchases he had not made in years.
'Customers we haven't heard from in a while are coming out of the woodwork,' said Scott, the executive vice president of Air Handling Systems. 'The biggest difference for me is the volatility is gone.'
Manufacturing is now a smaller part of the overall U.S. economy, which is driven largely by the fast-growing service sector. Still, there are signs of a potential pickup, even for manufacturing. A popular manufacturing gauge, the Institute for Supply Management survey, recently reported its first expansionary reading since July.
Trump's recent 'Phase One' trade deal with China includes promises that China will buy more U.S. manufacturing and agricultural products in the next two years, another reason for optimism in sectors hit hard by the trade war.
'The Chinese are sticking to the Phase One deal,' Larry Kudlow, Trump's top economic adviser, said in an interview. 'The president had a good phone call [Thursday] night with [Chinese President] Xi Jinping. Xi said, 'Look, the expected purchase of U.S. exports may be slightly delayed, but we will make it.' '
Michael Canty, president of Alloy Bellows - Precision Welding in Cleveland, is more confident about manufacturing after the recent China deal and Trump's signing of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
'All boom cycles have an end " we all know that. But I think this is going to continue for at least another two years,' Canty said. 'The reason for that is the trade deals and the regulations that have come off. They are having an effect now.'
There are two big question marks for the U.S. economy this year " how bad the impact of the coronavirus will be and whether business spending will pick up. Kudlow and many private-sector economists have predicted a small impact from the deadly coronavirus on the U.S. economy, shaving off about 0.2-percent from first-quarter growth. But it is yet another reason for leaders of large multinational companies to worry.
While consumers have continued spending at a healthy rate, business investment outside the housing sector contracted from April through December. Many leaders of large corporations do not hold the same economic ebullience that consumers and small-business owners do.
'When we look at the CEO confidence survey, it's quite a different story,' said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators and surveys at the Conference Board. 'They are much more pessimistic. Trade has taken a toll on business investment.'
There are also concerns about the U.S. economy that Democratic presidential candidates have been talking up frequently, especially the lack of higher-paying jobs and the often burdensome costs of health care, child care and college.
Jobs that pay middle-class wages have been going away in recent years, replaced with really high-wage and really low-wage work. That trend is ongoing despite Trump's repeated promises of a 'blue-collar boom.'
'By and large, we are producing a lot of low-quality jobs,' said Mark Muro, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. 'But a job is a job for a jittery nation.'

Fed's Harker Says Rates Should Remain Steady; The Philadelphia Federal Reserve leader said the U.S. economy is in a good place and he sees no reason for the central bank to change its interest-rate target for now

Philadelphia Federal Reserve leader Patrick Harker said Monday the U.S. economy is in a good place right now and he sees no reason for the central bank to change its interest-rate target for now.
"My own view right now is that we should hold steady for a while and watch how developments and the data unfold before taking any more action," Mr. Harker said in the text of a speech prepared for delivery before an event in Delaware.
Mr. Harker is a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year. The Fed lowered rates three times in 2019 to give an otherwise healthy economy some protection from trade-policy uncertainty and slowing global growth.
Mr. Harker, like a number of officials, was skeptical of the need for those rate cuts, saying last year he didn't see lowering borrowing costs doing much to spur activity when uncertainty about the future was the main source of trouble.
Fed officials so far have given few hints they want to change rates this year. The Fed's official outlook in December projected the federal-funds target-rate range would hold steady at between 1.50% and 1.75% this year. But financial markets, spooked by China's coronavirus and other factors, see rate cuts coming by year-end, according to the fed-funds futures market. So far, no Fed officials have joined that view.
Mr. Harker said "it's too early to say what impact the spread of the coronavirus will have on the global economy, but the negative effects on the Chinese economy and international travel are something to watch."
But for the most part, Mr. Harker sees good things for the year.
"I think the economy is in good shape," Mr. Harker said. "We are in the longest economic expansion on record, and I see growth returning to trend of about 2% this year." Mr. Harker said recent job-market data has been good but he nevertheless expects monthly job gains to moderate. He said the jobless rate, now at 3.6%, will stay under 4% for the next couple of years.
Mr. Harker said price pressures also are pointing up. "We haven't quite met our 2% inflation target, but we're on track to get there. While the process has been a slow one, I still believe that the inflation rate will rise to meet our goal," he said.
The official also said that mortgage refinancing, tied to lower Fed rates, will be a plus for the economy.
Philadelphia Fed research says that with no change in mortgage rates about 60% of homeowners may refinance this year, and over the next couple of years that could boost the overall consumption level by $11.2 billion. "On an individual level, an average homeowner would have about $2,000 to spend in extra consumption within the first year after refinancing—a nice lift to almost any budget," Mr. Harker said.

Dollar's Surge Is Hurdle for Shares

Investors worried about the impact of the coronavirus on the world economy might soon have to confront another challenge to corporate profits: a strengthening dollar.
The currency has climbed steadily since the number of coronavirus cases began surging in China last month, pushing the WSJ Dollar Index to its highest level since early October. With many analysts concerned that disruptions to the Chinese economy will dent global growth, investors have been clinging to U.S. assets, helping the S&P 500 rebound from its late-January slide and rise last week to a record.
Although major indexes and the dollar have climbed in tandem, U.S. companies including Johnson &Johnson, Coca-Cola Co., Ford Motor Co. and 3M Co. have mentioned on earnings calls the negative effects of currency swings, highlighting a possible challenge to the longstanding bull market. A stronger dollar makes it more expensive for companies to bring home foreign sales and makes exporters' products less competitive abroad.
Fourth-quarter profits for S&P 500 firms are on track to stay roughly flat compared with a year earlier, extending a trend from earlier in 2019. The combination of weak global growth and a strong dollar raises the possibility that earnings could disappoint again this year.
Any negative impact from the dollar could amplify the fallout from the coronavirus, which has already forced chains from Starbucks Corp. to Nike Inc. to close stores in China temporarily.
Some firms, including McDonald's Corp. and Yum China Holdings Inc., which operates Pizza Hut and KFC in the country, have already discussed the uncertain impact of the virus.
"No one knows how this outbreak will play out, and we don't know how it will ultimately impact us," Richard Fain, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. chief executive, said on the company's earnings call last week. The company has canceled some cruises out of China.
Analysts expect S&P 500 profit growth to accelerate to 10% or higher in the last two quarters of 2020, according to FactSet, a projection that some investors fear will now be hard to hit.
Investors will be monitoring results this week from a group highlighted by PepsiCo Inc., Cisco Systems Inc. and Nvidia Corp.
A rising dollar also affects emerging markets and commodities by making investments denominated in the U.S. currency more expensive for overseas buyers.
Additionally, it becomes more costly for developing countries to service dollar-denominated debt when the currency climbs.
Investors have for years expected global economic growth to weaken the dollar, only for the currency to defy those predictions.
President Trump has criticized the dollar's strength in recent years, arguing that it places the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage. He has also cited the dollar in his criticism of the Federal Reserve, urging the central bank to lower interest rates further.
The currency's recent stability follows three Fed rate cuts in the last half of 2019, the latest example of sturdy U.S. growth attracting investors but potentially adding to a murky earnings backdrop for large companies.
"Expectations might not be met, and that's a market risk," said Lauren Goodwin, an economist and multiasset portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments, which holds a smaller position in U.S. stocks than the benchmark it tracks. "Markets can only defy fundamentals for so long."
Multinational companies have already been under pressure, with earnings from S&P 500 firms that get more than half of their revenue outside the U.S. coming in worse than profits for more domestically oriented companies for much of last year.
Many of those firms are contending with the prospect of weaker Chinese demand and a stronger dollar.
"They're facing a double whammy," said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors, which has been favoring U.S. stocks and the dollar recently.
The dollar and other investments tied to U.S. growth also outpaced others for much of 2019, with analysts worried about trade tensions.
Coming into the year, many investors had expected the trend to reverse following an initial trade deal and clarity on the U.K.'s exit from the European Union.
Instead, traders are questioning whether the world economy can reaccelerate.
"That story is now on hold," said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. "We're maintaining our preference for the U.S. because it's the best from an economic growth standpoint."
Still, some analysts don't see the dollar climbing out of its recent trading range, particularly with the Fed indicating it plans to leave rates low for now. Many are skeptical that an unforeseen event such as the coronavirus that boosts the currency temporarily can provide longer-term support without also threatening economic growth in the U.S.
For now, investors have kept buying U.S. assets. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on everything from student debt to auto loans, fell last week to its lowest level since early October. Yields fall as bond prices rise.
Traders have also cited a reversal in investor positioning in explaining the market's recent swings. Net investor bets on a stronger U.S. currency rose in three consecutive weeks through Feb. 4, after last month hitting their lowest level since 2018, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Scotiabank. The reversal is another example of many betting against the dollar, only for it to attract investors during turbulent times.
That bearish positioning "getting beaten out of the market has been a very consistent theme," said Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest-rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. "The safe-haven narrative is absolutely critical."

As China shuts down swaths of the country to contain a fast-spreading virus, Fabien Gaussorgues is struggling to keep running a business that makes consumer electronics for small-business customers in North America.
The chief executive of Agilian Technology Co. isn't sure if he can get enough of his 80-person staff back to restart his factory after the extended Lunar New Year holidays. Even if he does, he can't get hold of quality controllers to certify his factories, and he can't get shipments flown to customers because so many flights from China have been canceled.
"We have warned our customers that air shipments might be impossible in the next three months," Mr. Gaussorgues said. "Suppliers can't commit to anything at this time. This is the No. 1 danger. It might force us to stop production."
Mr. Gaussorgues's woes are emblematic of the problems facing companies as they try to restart operations following the lockdown caused by a coronavirus that emerged from Wuhan, which has infected more than 37,000 people and killed more than 800 in China. The country's restrictions -- which are beginning to be lifted -- have choked supplies, restricted travel and limited the ability of employees to report to work.
The virus is the latest blow to businesses in the world's largest manufacturing economy, which also has been hurt by a bruising trade war with the U.S. And while production disruptions are expected to affect companies of all sizes -- including companies like Apple Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. -- smaller concerns are particularly vulnerable.
"Suddenly, an existential threat has come up, and many organizations are re-evaluating their supply chains," said Renaud Anjoran, chief executive of Sofeast Ltd., a China-focused quality assurance and engineering firm. He said thousands of small and midsize Chinese factories may shut as a result of the production shocks.
China extended its new-year holidays three days to Feb. 2, and kept most businesses shut thereafter to combat the outbreak. Many factories are scheduled to reopen on Monday, although it is unclear how many can. Many workers can't leave their hometowns, and employers still have to pay them. Factories that do open might have to operate with lower productivity because of labor shortage, new screening requirements and lack of parts.
German auto maker Volkswagen AG on Saturday said it is pushing back the date to resume production at some plants to Feb. 17, citing challenges in its supply chain and in securing factory workers as they face limited travel options.
"If several key suppliers suddenly close down, or are several months late in their shipments, it is a deadly threat to a business," Mr. Anjoran said.
The coronavirus first hit businesses clustered in and around Wuhan, as car makers including Hyundai Motor Co. and industrial conglomerates such as Hitachi Ltd. suspended production. Then it amplified in the supply networks that crisscross the country.
Agilian, based in Dongguan, in southern China, told its customers that production would be hit for at least February and very likely March too. Out of his staff of 80, Mr. Gaussorgues expects only 15 will be working next week, if the factory is allowed to reopen, and possibly 30 thereafter. The rest will be homebound by infection worries and policies.
"Our business continuity plan addressed risks such as fire, but not the lockdown of the entire country," Mr. Gaussorgues said.
Mr. Gaussorgues said the combination of rising costs and increased risks of producing in China might cause him to consider leaving China.
"We could already feel pressure last year to relocate to another country," he said. "We will certainly feel stronger pressure to do that in 2020."

Natural disasters are unpredictable events with broadly predictable results: a destruction of property and wealth, but no lasting impact on economic growth.
Australia's wildfires, which have ravaged more than 26,000 square miles of land and killed at least 30 people, will be the latest big test of that view. At stake is the country's 28-year run without a recession -- the longest continuing streak in the developed world.
Natural disasters inflict immediate pain on an economy because they disrupt activity, stopping consumers from going to the shops and shutting businesses for a time. Later comes a growth kick as damaged infrastructure and wrecked buildings get rebuilt. In Australia's New South Wales state, more than 2,000 homes have been destroyed by fires that have torn through an area the size of West Virginia, mostly in the past couple of months.
Australia's central bank believes the economy will quickly weather the impact of the wildfires. On Feb. 4, it said the blazes would exert just a temporary drag on growth, as it forecast a 2.75% expansion in gross domestic product this year.
Among economists, however, a range of views has opened up. Westpac Banking Corp. says its estimate that the bush fires will cut GDP by 0.2 percentage point appears conservative, given other forecasters are projecting a hit to growth of up to 0.5 point. The recent coronavirus outbreak poses another serious economic threat, as China is the top buyer of Australian commodities, and many mainland tourists and students travel to cities including Sydney.
Australia's economy was already flashing warning signs before the first blazes flared, with U.S.-China trade frictions taking a toll. One survey of consumer confidence released late last year found that 40% of Australians thought 2020 would be worse than 2019, the worst reading since the early 1990s.
The country's central bank cut interest rates three times last year, giving a boost to employment growth, but the fires' impact could stall hiring.
"The combined impact of global trade disruptions, slow local consumption, the residential construction downturn, drought and the ongoing bush-fire crisis are taking their toll on local production this summer," said Innes Willox, chief executive of Ai Group, which represents businesses.
The Australian government has established an initial $1.3 billion bush-fire recovery fund. Still, a big uncertainty is how quickly two of the country's biggest industries -- tourism and agriculture -- bounce back.
Tourism operators say longer-term bookings are down after images of Australia on fire went global. Many wilderness areas and campgrounds popular with domestic tourists remain shut. Last month, authorities scrambled to get tourists out of a 5,000-square-mile zone threatened by fire, with many visitors evacuated from the cutoff beach resort of Mallacoota by a naval ship.
"If you saw that TV vision, would you be bringing your kids back down here?" said Paul Preston, who has owned the Beachcomber Caravan Park in Mallacoota for about 20 years.
Oxford Economics, an advisory firm, last month estimated losses to Australia's tourism industry at $3 billion, or around 5% of revenue for accommodation and food services, noting the fires happened during peak travel season. "But the final impact could be higher than this," it said.
Since then, the tourism industry has suffered another blow as the coronavirus spread. Australia's government has barred foreign nationals who have been in mainland China from entering the country. Qantas Airways Ltd., Australia's national flag carrier, has suspended flights to the mainland.
To assess the fires' impact, Commonwealth Bank of Australia studied salary data as a proxy for economic activity in the aftermath of previous natural disasters. It found the negative effects of previous bush fires were more enduring than from floods.
Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, said rebuilding may not happen as quickly as many experts think.
Insurers could become leery about covering homes where there is a fire risk. Some analysts say banks have recently been unwilling to give home loans to people in inland areas. Builders may also wait to see if an inquiry into the bush-fire disaster resets construction codes.
"Some rural communities may never fully recover, particularly where industries have been destroyed," Mr. Oliver said.
In eastern Australia, the fires follow a three-year drought that has stretched rural finances. Crops and livestock herds can take years to rebuild. Many farmers lost equipment and fences that weren't insured.
Stephen Shipton, who runs a 1,100-acre farm in Cobargo, New South Wales, lost a third of his cattle and estimates it will be three years before his herd recovers.

'Wheels up!': Inside the State Dept.'s effort to get Americans out of Wuhan

For two solid weeks, all day and all night, government experts crowded into a narrow room on the top floor of the State Department, peering into computer screens lined up on a huge conference table and noshing from a buffet of sugary and salty snacks.
Their mission was straightforward " to monitor and coordinate the evacuation of hundreds of Americans from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.
But the logistics were in cred ibly complicated. The assembled task force included officers from the Bureau of Consular Affairs to check manifests and passports, China desk hands to communicate with authorities in Wuhan, liaisons from the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services to check manifests and track the flights " and, above all, specialists from the State Department's special crisis medicine unit who kept in touch with health professionals aboard planes as they screened passengers and monitored their conditions.
It all came together Thursday night when the digital clock on the wall, showing the times in Pyongyang, Seoul, Beijing, Moscow, Tehran, Paris and London, turned to 18:40 in Washington.
'Wheels up!' shouted a woman who had been tracking the progress of the first of two Boeing 747s that had just lifted off from the Wuhan airport. The room erupted in whoops and applause from more than a dozen government specialists who had been tensely awaiting that precise moment.
Then they quickly pivoted to tracking the progress of the second aircraft. All passengers aboard. Doors closed. Taxiing. Then, at 7:18 p.m., another jubilant 'Wheels up.'
Some Americans stranded in Wuhan have criticized the U.S. response, saying they found it difficult to sign up for the flights or learn when the next one would leave. Others complained about the approximately $1,000 they have to pay for each seat, saying the price is prohibitively expensive for families. Once back in the United States, many will face 14 days of quarantine on a military base before they can go home.
The flights that left Thursday night were the last of several evacuations carried out in the past week. One chartered plane carrying more than 200 passengers back to the United States arrived last weekend, and two more planes with 350 passengers arrived Wednesday. State Department officials say there may be more in the future, though none are scheduled at the moment.
Steve Biegun, deputy secretary of state, is a member of the interagency Coronavirus Task Force that is leading the U.S. response to the outbreak. A visit to the State Department room, down the hallway from the offices of Biegun and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, offered a glimpse of the undertaking's complexity.
The room is the size of a small conference room. At times, as many as 20 officials have been there at work.
The walls are covered with whiteboards and maps of China, including one showing concentric circles radiating out from Wuhan. A large screen filling a wall at one end of the room alternates between news alerts on the coronavirus to flight-tracking maps. A table covered with potato chips, doughnuts, Twizzlers, rice cakes, cookies, popcorn and nuts has contributed to what the workers call the 'Ops 15,' referring to the number of pounds some of them stand to gain working there.
Some of those seated around the conference table that takes up more than half the room's square footage cross-checked passenger manifests with consular officers from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and consulates elsewhere in China, recruited to help after the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan was evacuated.
Several members of the State Department's operational medicine staff, a unit created to respond to emergencies such as those requiring large-scale evacuations, talked on the phone with William Walters, the unit's director. He was in Wuhan overseeing a staff of medical experts, including EMTs and nurse practitioners. They were suited up in protective clothing and masks as they took passengers' temperatures before boarding, even though they had also been screened by Chinese medics.
Anyone who developed a fever while en route to the United States would have to be isolated from the rest of the passengers in a special section set apart from the main cabin.
As at mission control at NASA, much of the work has a rote feel to it, but every step of progress is announced loudly so everyone in the room can hear.
'Doors are closed and ready to go,' a woman in touch with the pilots said, prompting conversations in the room to drop off as if all were holding their breath until she could verify that the plane was heading down the runway.
A child's voice rose up from a speakerphone in the center of the table. It was from inside the plane.
'There are a lot of children on the plane,' one task-force member said.
In the stilted language of the State Department, protecting the safety and welfare of U.S. citizens is a top priority. As many of the men and women gathered on the seventh floor of the State Department put it Thursday night, 'We're here to help Americans get home.'

WHO praises China despite flaws in virus response

As a mysterious virus spread through Wuhan last month, the World Health Organization had a message: China has got this. 
And as the coronavirus swept across the Chinese heartland and jumped to other nations, the WHO's director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, applauded the 'transparency' of the Chinese response.
Even as evidence mounted that Chinese officials had silenced whistleblowers and undercounted cases, Tedros took a moment to extol the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Now " more than a month into an escalating global health crisis " there are questions about whether the WHO's praise in the early weeks created a false sense of security that potentially spurred the virus's spread.
'We were deceived,' said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University who also provides technical assistance to the WHO.
'Myself and other public health experts, based on what the World Health Organization and China were saying, reassured the public that this was not serious, that we could bring this under control,' he continued. 
'We were,' he added, 'giving a false sense of assurance.' 
On Saturday, the death toll from the new coronavirus recorded its largest daily jump " 86 " to raise the count to more than 800 deaths, nearly all in China. In doing so, the toll surpassed the total number of fatalities " 774 people " attributed to the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2002 and 2003. In Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, the first deaths of an American and a Japanese citizen were recorded.
Managing the outbreak of a new infection is never easy. In times of crisis, the WHO " a U.N. agency based in Geneva " must work with member countries to get information and coordinate a response. 
Experts familiar with the workings of the WHO, including current and former advisers, stressed that careful diplomacy and public praise can keep countries in crisis from shutting out the world.
The agency learned valuable lessons from the 2002 outbreak of SARS, which China initially tried to cover up. The agency is doing much right this time around, some experts said. 
But some fear that the WHO's embrace of China's numbers and assessments in the early stages of this outbreak, as well as its ongoing praise for the country's response, are testing the agency's global credibility right when it needs it most.
'I'm concerned about whether they can actually assume leadership effectively in terms of the international response,' said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.
'People trust the organization to be the guardian of global health because it is politically neutral and has expertise.' 
A statement from the WHO said 'ensuring open lines of communications' is critical in efforts to bring a disease outbreak under control.
'To date, 99-percent of the cases are still in China,' the statement added. 'The government committed early on to working with WHO, sharing data and more. The Chinese government are in the lead for their national response and WHO is doing its utmost to support them, for the sake of the Chinese people and the world.'
The WHO said that Tedros 'welcomes and expects scrutiny of the response effort. Everyone's focus must be on ending the outbreak.'
How SARS changed responses
The SARS epidemic shook China and changed the way the WHO responds to threats.
In the aftermath of the crisis, updated rules required the WHO to report emerging diseases and gave it broader power to investigate threats using nonstate sources of information such as civil society groups. 
One of the goals: preventing coverups.
In late December, rumors of a mysterious virus started circulating on Chinese social media. China notified the WHO on Dec.-31 that there was a pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan. Based on Chinese data, the WHO issued a Jan. 5 statement saying there were 44 cases and no evidence of person-to-person transmission.
But a Washington Post reconstruction of events showed that by Jan. 5, some Wuhan authorities knew that doctors were discussing the spread of a SARS-like virus. For this, they were detained and denounced.
It also found that local officials undercounted cases. 
'My sense is there was delay in getting information from Wuhan to Beijing, even as Beijing was relatively open about sharing with WHO,' said Mara Pillinger, an associate in global health policy and governance at Georgetown's O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law.
David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and current chair of the WHO's advisory committee on infectious hazards, defended the response.
'It is very difficult in the beginning of an outbreak to understand the potential,' he said, pointing to U.S. failures in the early days of the AIDS crisis and Canada's struggle to coordinate provincial and federal authorities during SARS.
Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the WHO was doing a good job under tough conditions.
But she noted that critical epidemiological data that researchers use to understand a virus " information about who got sick, when " was slow to get out from China.
'One criticism that we should direct at WHO is that when it puts out situation reports, they are basically missing data from China,' she said. 
'It's fair to ask, 'If you don't have data, why not? And what are you doing about it?'
Defense of China
In late January, China moved from denial to drastic action.
On Jan.-20, with 400-million people about to travel for the Lunar New Year holiday, officials confirmed what many had long suspected: The virus could spread person to person. 
President Xi called for swift, transparent action. 'It is necessary to release epidemic information in a timely manner and deepen international cooperation,' according to state media reports. 
Authorities started to seal off Wuhan, a city of 11-million, canceling some flights, trains and suspending public transportation. 
In Geneva, an emergency panel convened to discuss the situation and decide whether to declare a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, which signals 'serious, unusual or unexpected' health crisis 'that poses a public health risk to other countries through international spread.' 
On Jan. 22, Tedros applauded China's recent efforts. 'What they are doing is a very, very strong measure and with full commitment,' he said
The comment surprised public health experts because travel bans can create panic and make things harder for first responders.
On Jan. 23, China announced it was expanded the quarantine to other cities " and millions more people. 
Later the same day, in Geneva, the WHO decided against declaring a PHEIC. That meant, among other things, no calls for restrictions on travel in and out of China, even as Beijing locked down the Chinese heartland.
Asked about China's quarantine, Tedros demurred.
'At end of the day, a sovereign country has the autonomy to do what it thinks is right,' he said, adding that he hoped it would be short.
In China, officials were increasingly talking about what went wrong. In a Jan.-27 interview, Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang admitted that information should have been released more quickly. 
But in a visit to Beijing, Tedros commended officials. The state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that Tedros lauded not only the coronavirus response, but the very effectiveness of 'China's system.'
On his return from Beijing, he heaped compliments on China and its president. 
'I was very encouraged and impressed by the president's detailed knowledge of the outbreak and his personal involvement in the outbreak,' he said. 'This was for me a very rare leadership.'
On Jan.-30 the WHO declared a PHEIC, finally acknowledging the risk the Wuhan outbreak posed to other countries. 'The Chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak,' Tedros said, adding that China is setting 'a new standard' for outbreak response.
'Tricky balancing act'
Some experts have defended the comments as sound strategy. 
'WHO has really tricky balancing act,' said Devi Sridhar, a professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh. 'If that means praising China publicly, that's what he has to do.'
Others worried that it could shake faith in the U.N. body. 
Praising China's leaders 'is not a bad idea, but do you want to do it in a professional and credible way,' said the Council on Foreign Relations' Huang. 
For now, the WHO seems to be sticking with the strategy. 
At a new conference on Thursday, Tedros was asked, again, about China, including the death of one of the Chinese doctors who sounded the alarm on the virus, only to be detained by police. (He later died of the virus.)
He first deferred to a colleague, then took the chance to speak again, defending China's handling of the epidemic. 'It is very difficult, given the facts,' he said, 'to say that China was hiding.'

Before Marc Valitutto could begin hunting for a deadly virus, he had to find a snake hook for a monk.
As a wildlife veterinarian, Valitutto hadn't received training on how to build trust with people. But shortly after he arrived in Myanmar to look for viruses capable of jumping from animals to humans " such as Zika, Ebola and the coronavirus that is responsible for the current outbreak " he realized he was going to have to learn on the job. 
He was going to have to prove to locals who had no reason to trust his presence and every reason to fear it that he was there to help. 
He was going to have to find that snake hook because that monk needed it to handle the venomous reptiles in the caves he protected, and Valitutto needed that monk to let him test bats in those caves.
'To even start the work, it took a year and a half of just building that trust,' recalls Valitutto, who works for the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute's Global Health Program. 
It took listening to the priorities and fears of local residents. He says some of their early concerns included: 'What are our motives? Are we going to respect their religion, their culture? If we find disease, is it going to destroy their tourism industry or destroy their agricultural industry?' 
For so many of us, the emergence of the coronavirus in the Wuhan area of China feels like a sudden threat, a conjured contagion we didn't know to fear until it was here, in front of our facemask-less faces. 
But for the past decade, a team of wildlife experts from the Smithsonian has been working with other organizations across the world to find these zoonotic diseases to reduce their pandemic potential.
The work Valitutto and others did in Myanmar is just one piece of that massive effort, but it is an important one because it led to the discovery of a new coronavirus in bats. That coronavirus " unlike the one that has killed more than 800 people in China, including a doctor in recent days " is not believed to pose a health threat to humans at the moment.
Threat level aside, the story behind the discovery is worth unraveling because it shows the painstaking planning, the on-the-ground labor and the widespread collaboration that is needed to get ahead of these viruses.
It shows how connected we all are to one another and to the wildlife around us. 
Suzan Murray, director of the Smithsonian's Global Health Program and former chief veterinarian of the zoo, says it was once normal for people to talk about the environment and human health separately. Now, she says, there is a 'holistic approach.' There is recognition that human health is tied to the health of the environment and the wildlife in it. 
'I always knew I would be a wildlife veterinarian,' Murray says. 'Since the age of 5, I knew I was going to work with endangered species. But I never thought I would have the chance to affect human lives, so that is exciting and really rewarding.' 
Exactly how rewarding though? Is the work that is happening unseen behind the scientific curtain going to keep us safe? I ask Murray as we talk one recent afternoon. 
'I think we're vastly more prepared than we were 10 years ago,' she says. 'The people behind the curtain know more than they used to.' 
The Smithsonian's Myanmar project and another in Kenya were part of a larger effort called PREDICT, which involved five organizations working in 30 countries for the U.S. Agency for International Development's Emerging Pandemic Threats program. The lead organization was the One Health Institute at the University of California at Davis. 
Samples collected and tested in Myanmar were sent to the institute, which determined that that coronavirus hadn't yet been detected anywhere else in the world. It is not believed to have the ability to cause serious health problems.
'We don't think it poses a big threat to the human population, at least not now,' Murray says. 'But you never know what's going to happen in the future, and at least we have that information.' 
Getting that information wasn't quick or easy. It took years. It required setting up laboratories in Myanmar, establishing partnerships with local government agencies and buying protective gear for humans and GPS collars for bats. 
It required not only gaining the trust of local residents, but also hiring and training some to do the testing.
Without their help, Valitutto says, he couldn't have navigated sweltering caves that offered little ventilation and housed poisonous snakes and other dangerous animals. 
'We were going into caves you can't breathe in,' he says. The caves were often hotter inside than outside, and he along with a team of about 20 locals had to step into them while wearing body suits, goggles and masks. Once inside, they often found themselves standing in bat feces as it fell on them. 
The team also worked in the night and in torrential rain. 
When outbreaks happen, there is a tendency to blame the country where it started for not doing more, Valitutto says. But the work done for PREDICT shows that communities in countries across the world have been working, and working hard, toward the same goal of protecting people. 
'They're working alongside us hand-in-hand to prevent these from spreading,' he says. But it's work that requires ongoing support and funding. 'The work that we're doing is a lifelong thing. It's a forever thing.' 
Valitutto moved to Myanmar five years ago to start the project and remained there until it wrapped up in September. An official meeting to bring PREDICT to a close is scheduled to occur in the District in March. In the past 10 years, Murray says, PREDICT teams have found more than 1,200 new mammalian viruses, including 160 coronaviruses. 
To find that single Myanmar virus, Valitutto estimates his team collected as many as 1,000 bats and took more than 10,000 samples from saliva and feces. They also went beyond disease detection. They studied human behavior in the region to understand the ways in which the virus might jump.
Many of the caves serve as holy places, and custom calls for people to take off their shoes and socks, leaving their feet exposed, Valitutto says. Bats in that region, similar to China, are also eaten and sold in wild animal markets. 
Experts say the outbreak that has infected tens of thousands of people probably resulted from a wild animal market in Wuhan. Bats were quickly identified as a likely culprit. More recently, a new possible suspect emerged " the pangolin, a critically endangered animal that is often killed for its meat and scales. 
The pangolin is what initially pulled Valitutto into the wildlife field. It is the most trafficked mammal in the world, and he has spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to save it. 
During the SARS epidemic in the early 2000s, he says, some pangolins tested positive for the coronavirus. At that time, he says, it hit him that maybe the best way to help the pangolin is by helping people. Maybe people would stop eating them if they knew they could carry a deadly disease.
'I came into my career with a focus on wildlife, and not so much an interest in working with humans,' he says. 'Now, I realize cannot save wildlife unless I'm saving people, too.' 
He is currently working with pangolins and giant pandas for the Smithsonian. 
For that work, he has now settled in a new country: China. 
'Far from Wuhan,' he tells me when we Skype one recent evening. 
He is in Chengdu, which is about 700 miles from the outbreak's epicenter. 
He has used that distance to reassure his relatives who have called more frequently lately. He has also told them about the precautions the country is taking to keep the virus contained. He is required to wear a mask in public and have his temperature checked three times a day.
Other Americans have fled that region, but Valitutto does not have plans yet to return to the District. 
'I have my general fears, but I know the measures that China has taken, and I know how to protect myself,' he says. 'I'm not entirely too worried about contracting it.' 
For him, unlike most people, the threat does not feel new. He has spent years knowing it existed.

Quarantined cruise passengers desperate to escape virus and confinement

YOKOHAMA, Japan " For now, only the sick can leave. 
In the four days since the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined around 3,700 passengers and crew members in a Japanese port, the few dozen who have disembarked were wheeled off on stretchers and helped into ambulances. They coughed and ached and burned with fever " the latest to fall ill as the coronavirus outbreak spreads rapidly across Asia. 
Growing desperate after days of being cooped up, Vana Mendizabal, 69, suddenly realized: What if her only escape route from the ship and the mandatory 14-day quarantine would be to come down with the virus? 
She is one of hundreds of Americans stuck on the cruise ship halfway around the world, in a confinement that is one of the strange repercussions of the coronavirus epidemic that was first documented in Wuhan, China, in December. Since then, more than 31,000 people have been infected and more than 630 people have died " most of them in China. Cases have also been recorded in more than two dozen countries. 
Vana Mendizabal's travel insurance won't arrange an evacuation unless she falls ill. Japan won't allow anyone off the ship unless they are being transported to a hospital or have completed at least two weeks in quarantine. U.S. officials have not offered another solution to evacuate American passengers who are anxiously holed up on the cruise liner. 
Mendizabal and her husband, Mario, 75, who are from Crystal River, Fla., feel stranded as they run out of clean clothes and patience.
'We are trying to somehow reach the State Department in hopes they will get us off here,' Vana Mendizabal said in a phone call from the couple's cabin. 'We are confined to our cabins, we're breathing recirculated air, and it's not a healthy environment for us to be staying in.' 
'We just want to get off the ship,' she said. A friend with whom the Mendizabals are traveling learned Thursday that her mother had died back home, news that compounded their group's sense of urgency.
A State Department official said Friday that U.S. officials were closely tracking the situation aboard the ship and that 'once the passengers on the Diamond Princess finish their 14-day quarantine period, they will be permitted to depart Japan on commercial flights, which are readily available, and will not be subject to additional quarantine upon return to the United States.' 
But as the number of sick steadily ticked up to 61 Friday, fears mounted among passengers that the quarantine could potentially expose them to the virus rather than protect them from it. 
The outbreak on the ship is believed to have begun when an infected passenger carried the virus onto the ship, later disembarking in Hong Kong. 
Alan Steele, 58, is among the dozens of people aboard the cruise liner who have since learned they have the virus. Steele and his wife, Wendy, married last month and were celebrating their honeymoon with a cruise vacation that has turned into a nightmare. 
'I have been infected and am being transferred to hospital,' Alan Steele said via Facebook Messenger on Friday. 'Must say I am not showing any symptoms at the moment.' 
Wendy, a nurse, is to celebrate her 52nd birthday Tuesday, and her husband was to start a new job Monday. The couple was reluctant to be separated but only Alan tested positive for the virus and disembarked for treatment. 'It was a hard first night without Alan,' Wendy said the next morning. But she added that the pair are in constant communication and that 'Japanese doctors are excellent and he is in safe hands.'
All who tested positive have been or will be taken to local hospitals for treatment. 
Of the most recent 41 found to have the virus, 21 are in their 70s and six are in their 80s, Japan's public broadcaster NHK reported, citing the Ministry of Health. 
Japan's tourism industry has been badly hurt by the epidemic, and fears are mounting that the 2020 Tokyo Olympics could be disrupted. Aside from the 61 cases on the cruise ship, 25 people have tested positive for the virus in Japan. A second ship, the World Dream, is being quarantined in Hong Kong, pending test results and health checks for the 3,800 people aboard, after three passengers who sailed between Jan.-19 and Jan.-24 tested positive for the virus. 
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Thursday that foreigners would not be allowed to get off a third cruise ship, the Westerdam, which left Hong Kong on Saturday, except in special circumstances. The country's transport minister on Friday said similar measures would be implemented for other cruise ships if there were fears of infection aboard. 
Aboard the Diamond Princess, the tests were carried out on passengers and crew members deemed at highest risk of having caught the virus after an initial health screening, either because they showed symptoms or because they had interacted with the infected passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong.
The remaining passengers have been issued thermometers to check their own temperatures. And they've been left trying to make the best of a strange situation. The only interactions passengers have with anyone outside their cabins are visits by crew members delivering and removing food trays several times a day. 
Some passengers do not seem to mind. American passengers Matthew Smith and his wife, Katherine Codekas, both 57, regularly vacation on cruise ships and said even this experience on the Diamond Princess won't put them off taking another trip. 
'The only thing now is not to think about how much time remains,' Smith said. 'You just kind of take it day by day, moment by moment, and that's not so bad.' 
On Twitter, Smith posted a photo of food that had been delivered to his room: salmon, fresh bread and chocolate cake. 
'You might have to drag me off the ship when the quarantine ends,' he wrote, complimenting his feast. 
On Thursday, some passengers were allowed to spend time on a deck so long as they wore masks, kept at least three feet apart and avoided using elevators. They have been given rubber gloves to wear outside their cabins. 
But for some passengers, even just a few days in quarantine seem impossibly long. When the Mendizabals planned their three-week vacation, they did not imagine they would be in for an extra two weeks away from work and home. 
'It's been very disruptive,' Vana Mendizabal said. 'It's very stressful.'

EXCHANGE --- Chinese Shoppers' Absence Hits Luxury Brands Hard

A new Galeries Lafayette store in Paris dedicated to Chinese shoppers stood largely empty over the past week.
It was the same on Milan's Via Monte Napoleone, where almost every shop has hired a Chinese-speaking sales clerk in recent years. "If you think you see a Chinese shopper these days, it's probably a mirage," said Giovanni Cammaroto, who works in a Fendi store.
As China tries to contain the coronavirus, Chinese tourists are disappearing from major shopping capitals across the U.S. and Europe, and their absence is hurting some of the world's highest-profile luxury brands.
The outbreak has exposed how dependent high-end retailers in places such as New York, Paris and Milan have become on visitors from China, who often spend more than the typical tourist. Estee Lauder Cos. and Capri Holdings Ltd., which owns the Versace and Jimmy Choo brands, warned investors this week their financial results could suffer due to lower sales to Chinese travelers.
On Boulevard Haussmann in Paris, Galeries Lafayette's new store has signs in Chinese and a center where Chinese tourists can claim value-added tax refunds. Recently, rodent-shaped Lunar New Year posters in the store celebrated the Year of the Rat.
Normally at this time of year, the store would welcome more than 1,000 shoppers a day, said a salesman, with buses bringing them straight from outings to the Louvre or other sights. "We don't have any groups because of the virus," he said.
With most European airlines having canceled all flights from China, it was the same elsewhere.
"Until a week ago we still had large groups of Chinese coming through, but in the last few days it's been maybe one or two here and there," said Mr. Cammaroto in the Fendi store on Milan's Via Monte Napoleone.
The vanishing of Chinese shoppers matters to retailers a lot more than it did in the past. Almost 170 million residents of China traveled outside the country in 2018, the most recent year for which figures are available, according to the U.N. World Tourism Organization, and they spent about $277 billion. That is more than three times the number of travelers and five times the amount of spending as a decade earlier.
High-end retail has become especially dependent on Chinese tourists, who often prefer to get their Gucci bag in Milan, or their Hermes perfume in Paris, for the cheaper price, tax refund and perceived cachet of buying luxury products in their country of origin. Some brands also sell products in Europe that can't be found in China.
Globally, Chinese consumers last year bought nearly $110 billion worth of luxury goods, including clothes, leather goods and jewelry -- mostly outside China.
The U.S. economy overall could lose $10.3 billion in Chinese visitor spending due to the outbreak, according to estimates by the research firm Tourism Economics. Chinese represent 7% of all overseas visitors to the U.S., and they spent roughly $34 billion on travel and transportation services in 2019, including spending in the U.S. and on U.S. airlines, the firm said.
"We assume that there will be obviously an important reduction of Chinese travelers -- not visiting the U.S. -- in the next at least two, three months, and this will have a negative impact, obviously, on the sales to Chinese tourists," said Fabrizio Freda, the chief executive of Estee Lauder.
The company on Thursday nudged down its full-year financial outlook to account for the effects the coronavirus will have on its business.
Capri, whose brands also include Michael Kors, said on Wednesday that prolonged travel restrictions could decrease store traffic and pressure Chinese spending, in both China and countries frequented by Chinese tourists.
The company anticipates the outbreak in China to slash about $100 million in revenue on an adjusted basis in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in March.
"This estimate could materially change if the severity of the virus worsens, including potential broader impact on our business outside of China if outbound travel and tourist traffic is further restricted from China into other countries," said Chief Executive John Idol.
Burberry, the British luxury-fashion company, said Friday that the outbreak is hurting sales in China. "The spending patterns of Chinese customers in Europe and other tourist destinations have been less impacted to date but given widening travel restrictions, we anticipate these to worsen over the coming weeks," Burberry said.
Tapestry Inc., which owns handbag and accessory brands such as Coach and Kate Spade, on Thursday said it expects the epidemic to cut sales by about $200 million to $250 million for the second half of the fiscal year.
"The escalating coronavirus outbreak in China is now impacting our business, resulting in both significant traffic declines and the closure of the majority of our stores on the mainland," said Tapestry Chief Executive Jide Zeitlin.
"If the situation further deteriorates or the outbreak further affects demand outside of the country, this impact could be worse."
Chinese visitors have become a pillar of the European tourism industry. Italy, their top European destination, had 5.3 million overnight stays last year from Chinese visitors, who stay in Italy for almost 13 nights on average, more than for any other country's tourists, according to the Bank of Italy. Americans are in fifth place at 9.6 days.
In Paris, the average Chinese tourist spends about 1,000 euros ($1,099) during a trip, compared with 640 euros for tourists overall, according to the Paris Chamber of Commerce.
Chinese tourists shell out around 4 billion euros in France each year, according to the Bank of France.

EXCHANGE --- Markets News -- Commodities: Crude Drops on Fear of Falling Chinese Demand

Oil prices fell for the fifth week in a row as investors tried to gauge the fallout from a coronavirus that has sickened thousands of people in China and tamped down demand in the world's largest importer of oil.
Crude slid into a bear market on Monday, falling 20% from a recent peak in January, on worries about the virus's effect on the global economy in a world flooded with oil.
U.S. crude rose Wednesday and Thursday as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies met to debate a possible reduction in crude output. However, the cartel hit a snag when Russia rejected the Saudi-led effort to deepen OPEC's oil-production cuts.
West Texas Intermediate futures fell 1.2% to $50.32 a barrel on Friday, while Brent, the global gauge of prices, fell 0.8% to $54.47 a barrel.
Analysts are forecasting sizable cuts to oil-demand growth as a result of the coronavirus, with JPMorgan Chase &Co. slashing its global growth forecasts for the first quarter to 500,000 barrels a day from 1.15 million barrels a day. Investors are hoping the cartel and its allies will come to an agreement sometime next week.
"Overall, our neutral trading bias of this week is keeping us in a frame of mind in which we can construct a case for a WTI advance to about the $54 mark next week as easily as we can build an argument for a drop into fresh lows to around the $46 area," analysts at Ritterbusch &Associates wrote in a Friday note.
Elsewhere in commodities, natural-gas futures fell 0.2% to $1.858 per million British thermal units after hitting four-year lows earlier in the week. A mild winter has weighed on prices of the commodity, and analysts have little hope for a weather-driven recovery as the season wanes and models continue to predict warmer temperatures.

U.S. News: Report Gives Fed Breathing Room

The solid January employment report should comfort Federal Reserve officials about the state of the U.S. economy before the recent threats to global growth surfaced from the outbreak of the coronavirus in China last month.
Officials shifted to a make-no-moves posture in October after cutting interest rates to prevent a slowdown in manufacturing and trade from dragging down the broader U.S. economy.
In its semiannual report to Congress on Friday, the central bank said risks of weaker-than-expected growth had declined late last year but that possible spillovers from the effects of the coronavirus present a new risk to the outlook.
Fed officials at their meeting last week held their benchmark federal-funds rate steady in a range between 1.5% and 1.75%, and signaled little reason to change course for now.
"Recent indicators provide tentative signs of stabilization. The global slowdown in manufacturing and trade appears to be nearing an end, and consumer spending and services activity around the world continue to hold up," the Fed report said.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver the report and testify on Capitol Hill on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Friday's hiring report from the Labor Department showed employers added 211,000 jobs a month on average during the November-to-January period, up from the monthly average of 175,000 last year. The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.6% last month, and average hourly earnings rose 3.1% from a year ago. The share of Americans with a job and the number of people looking for work both rose last month.
The report follows recent surveys of business activity that showed continued strength in the services sector, along with a rebound in manufacturing last month, ending five months in which activity had contracted.
Headwinds remain for economic activity in the U.S. and abroad. The manufacturing sector has shed jobs in three of the past four months, including a drop of 12,000 jobs in January. Challenges include Boeing Co.'s halt to production of its troubled 737 MAX aircraft.
While officials are holding rates steady for now, they have signaled they see greater risks of surprises that could prompt them to more likely lower rates than to lift them. The coronavirus and the hit to growth in the world's second-largest economy is the latest example of such a development.
"It is too early to say what the full economic effect of the outbreak will be," said Randal Quarles, Fed vice chairman for bank supervision, in remarks Thursday in New York.
With inflation holding below the Fed's 2% target, officials mostly have ruled out reversing last year's rate cuts for the foreseeable future. Mr. Powell has said he would want to see a persistent and sustained rise in inflation before lifting rates. The Fed staff doesn't forecast this happening for several years.

Job Gains Strengthen Outlook --- Employers keep hiring, bringing workers off the sidelines despite modest wage gains

U.S. hiring strengthened in January as more Americans hopped into the labor market, helping rev up the economy at the start of the year.
Employers added 225,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.6% from 3.5% in December, an increase that reflected more people looking for work, the Labor Department said Friday.
Wages climbed 3.1% from a year earlier, a touch stronger than December's rise of 3%.
"The labor market and the consumer are the strength of the economy and they're in good shape," said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.
Some of the January job gains came in industries, such as construction and leisure and hospitality, that benefited from mild winter weather. Still, employers across an array of sectors added jobs. That helped lift monthly payroll growth for the past three months to an average of 211,000 jobs, compared with an average of 175,000 for all of last year.
Robert Jones, president of American Sale, an Illinois-based retailer of home-recreation goods such as trampolines and hot tubs, said his 200-person company will add about 20 workers this year. He expects a low unemployment rate and solid economy to help spur purchases of big-ticket items.
"When you have more demand, you have more to do, so you just need more people," Mr. Jones said.
Companies are drawing from a larger pool of job seekers to fill roles. In January, the share of Americans aged 25 to 54 working or looking for work ticked up to 83.1% from 82.9% in December, the highest rate since 2008.
A larger flow of workers into the labor force could be keeping wages from breaking out. In January, the average hourly earnings growth of 3.1% stayed within the relatively narrow range of the past year and a half. Wage growth for rank-and-file workers cooled to 3.3% in January, down from a recent peak of 3.8% in October.
"Even the modest increase in wages appears to be enough to draw back workers into the labor force," Mr. Winograd said.
Americans are less likely to feel the pinch from limited pay increases because inflation has been modest. December consumer prices excluding food and energy increased 2.3% from a year earlier, slightly higher than in 2018 but down from 2.4% in September.
A strong labor market should help propel the broader economy as more Americans have jobs and money to spend. Consumers helped drive the economy in 2019, which closed the year growing at a modest pace.
The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at its meeting last week, after cutting interest rates three times last year to buffer the economy against slowdowns in trade and manufacturing. January's employment report will offer Fed officials comfort in their wait-and-see approach to interest-rate moves.
Solid hiring has been a hallmark of the economic recovery of the past decade. U.S. employers have added to payrolls for 112 straight months, the longest streak of job gains on record.
Ace Sign Co., a 65-person Springfield, Ill.-based manufacturer of building signs, awnings and displays, is in hiring mode. Todd Bringuet, the company's chief executive, said he is looking to fill four positions to meet client demand. He said he is confident about his ability to hire.
Ace Sign has been able to spot engineering and technical talent through recruitment efforts at technical schools and has also seen increased interest from candidates in larger cities such as Chicago who are searching for quicker commutes and a lower cost of living, Mr. Bringuet said.
"We've had positions where I've had 200 applicants in a three-day period, and that was a little overwhelming," Mr. Bringuet said.
New risks to the economic outlook have emerged in recent weeks. Boeing Co. halted production of its troubled 737 MAX aircraft, an impediment to manufacturing output that is expected to reduce first-quarter U.S. growth. The coronavirus outbreak that originated in China could hinder a rebound in global manufacturing activity.
The rising number of confirmed coronavirus cases has worried some investors. Last week, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1.6%, which was its lowest level since October.
Major U.S. stock indexes had recouped their steep losses from last week, rising in recent days to close at records Thursday. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 277 points, or 0.9%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indexes each fell 0.5%.
Annual revisions released in Friday's jobs report showed the overall employment level for March 2019 was revised down by 514,000 jobs to 150.28 million. For all of 2019, employers added 2.096 million jobs, a downward revision of 12,000.

Companies that top earnings expectations aren't getting much reward from shareholders.
With results in from more than half of the companies in the S&P 500, those with positive surprises have seen an average share-price increase of 0.7% in the days surrounding their announcements, lower than the five-year average of 1%, according to an analysis by FactSet. Disappointing earnings are also prompting a more muted response: Shares of companies with earnings that lag behind analysts' estimates have fallen 2.4%, less than the half-decade average of 2.6%.
Investors' reluctance to send shares of winners higher comes as analysts scrutinize the valuations of stocks after big gains in 2019 and as they consider the potential for the coronavirus outbreak to hobble global economic growth. The uncertainty has injected fresh volatility into the market, with the S&P 500 jumping or dropping more than 1% on five of the past 10 trading days, after previously not moving that much in a single session since October.
"Anybody that reported good numbers last week, the stock reaction was probably much more negatively impacted because the market was in a downdraft," said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer of concentrated U.S. growth at AllianceBernstein Holding LP.
Among the companies that saw their stock prices decline even after beating earnings expectations was Starbucks Corp., which dropped 6.7% in the period FactSet uses in its analysis, from two days before its earnings release through two days after. Meanwhile, shares of American Airlines Group Inc. rose after its adjusted earnings surpassed expectations but then sank along with other airlines over the next two days as investors worried the outbreak would dent demand for travel. The stock declined 4% over the four-day span measured by FactSet.
The coronavirus has been a topic of concern on dozens of recent earnings calls. "No one is able to predict whether this is a one-quarter or two-quarter or three-quarter hit to revenues and earnings in that region," said Mariann Montagne, portfolio manager at Gradient Investments. "That's what puts a lot of these companies into limbo."
The broad stock index notched another record Thursday, more than recouping the 3.1% loss it suffered between Jan. 17 and Jan. 31 when uncertainty about the impact of the outbreak rattled investors.
Thursday marked the S&P 500's eighth closing record of 2020 and followed a 29% rally in 2019 that was powered by three interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and by easing trade tensions.
"We've had a very big rally," said Raheel Siddiqui, global macro strategist at Neuberger Berman Group LLC. "Following big rallies, the beats are not as rewarded. It's the market's way of telling you things are a little pricey."
Overall, 71% of S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten earnings expectations, in line with the five-year average of 72%. Among the S&P 500's sectors, utilities are expected to report the strongest year-over-year earnings growth, while energy companies are projected to report the largest decline in earnings. The technology sector is on pace for the highest percentage of companies with earnings beats.
Analysts forecast earnings for the S&P 500 as a whole to grow 0.7% from a year earlier in the fourth quarter of 2019. Investors project earnings growth will pick up in 2020 -- an expectation that could support the stock market's ascent.

U.S. stocks posted their biggest weekly gains in months, capping a volatile period that included stronger-than-expected data and uncertainty about the economic impact of the viral outbreak in China.
Major stock indexes recouped January's losses in recent days, rising to close at records Thursday.
Worries about economic growth around the world that preoccupied investors just days ago appear to have eased as corporate earnings and employment data have beaten expectations. Meanwhile, China outlined plans to slash tariffs, helping boost sentiment among traders and investors.
But the rally paused Friday, snapping a four-session winning streak for all three major U.S. indexes.
"Volatility in markets is going to be here for a while," said Marc Pfeffer, chief investment officer at CLS Investments.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 277.26 points, or 0.9%, to 29102.51 Friday, pulling back from Thursday's record. The S&P 500 fell 18.07 points, or 0.5%, to 3327.71.
Both indexes still posted their biggest weekly point gains since June.
The Nasdaq Composite lost 51.64 points, or 0.5%, to 9520.51 Friday, capping its best week on a point and percentage basis since November 2018.
The rising toll of the coronavirus has worried some investors, with the death toll climbing and the number of diagnosed patients topping 31,500.
A public backlash is escalating in China over the government's handling of the epidemic after a doctor died. In Singapore, the government on Friday raised its alert level, citing three new cases of infected people who have no known links to previous cases or recent travel history to China.
"We have seen an acceleration in the number of new cases and deaths, so I think there are some concerns about that, and whether the acceleration continues or whether they've got it under control," said Paul Flood, a fund manager at Newton Investment Management.
"If it extends from a three-month to a six-month or nine-month slowdown, then that would be concerning," Mr. Flood said.
Many U.S. firms expect the virus to dent their revenue and China's economic growth this year.
Still, fresh data showed that the U.S. labor market, a crucial indicator of the economy's health, remains on a strong footing.
The Labor Department said the U.S. economy added 225,000 jobs in January, beating expectations and putting the jobless rate at 3.6%. Wages increased 3.1% from a year earlier.
"It's hard not to like it," said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, of the jobs data.
Mr. Kinahan said the market decline appeared to be people taking profits ahead of the weekend after a week of gains.
Shares of manufacturing giants like Caterpillar Inc. and Boeing Co., which are exposed to the global economy, took big hits Friday, falling 2.8% and 1.4%, respectively, dragging on the Dow.
Some investors turned to the safety of government bonds.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to 1.578%, from 1.644% Thursday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.
Commodity prices also declined. Copper futures dropped 1.5% to $2.56 a pound following reports that Chinese importers had declared force majeure on purchases of the metal because of disruption caused by coronavirus.
China accounts for about half of global copper demand, making the price of the metal highly sensitive to swings in demand from the world's second-largest economy.
In corporate stocks, Uber Technologies Inc. rose 9.5% after the ride hailing and food delivery company said it would reach a measure of profitability a year sooner than previously expected. Rival Lyft Inc. gained 5.3%.
Shares of eBay Inc. dropped 4.7% after Intercontinental Exchange Inc., the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, abandoned its pursuit of the e-commerce platform. Intercontinental Exchange rose 2.8%.
The Stoxx Europe 600, which has also been trading at all-time highs, dropped 0.3% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed down 0.3%.
Elsewhere, the euro fell to a four-month low of $1.095 after fresh data showed German industrial activity unexpectedly plunged 3.5% in December from the prior month.
Economists had expected a slight uptick. Exports in the final month of 2019 also climbed more slowly than the consensus estimate.
Industrial production fell in France, the eurozone's second-largest economy behind Germany, and in Spain.
The data paint a picture that is "quite inconsistent about where you're seeing strength and weakness" in Europe, said Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. "There are some green shoots of optimism, but admittedly you have to look harder for them than you do in the U.S."

Quarantined cruise passengers desperate to escape virus and confinement

YOKOHAMA, Japan " For now, only the sick can leave. 
In the four days since the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined around 3,700 passengers and crew members in a Japanese port, the few dozen who have disembarked were wheeled off on stretchers and helped into ambulances. They coughed and ached and burned with fever " the latest to fall ill as the coronavirus outbreak spreads rapidly across Asia. 
Growing desperate after days of being cooped up, Vana Mendizabal, 69, suddenly realized: What if her only escape route from the ship and the mandatory 14-day quarantine would be to come down with the virus? 
She is one of hundreds of Americans stuck on the cruise ship halfway around the world, in a confinement that is one of the strange repercussions of the coronavirus epidemic that was first documented in Wuhan, China, in December. Since then, more than 34,000 people have been infected and more than 720 people have died " most of them in China. Cases have also been recorded in more than two dozen countries.
Vana Mendizabal's travel insurance won't arrange an evacuation unless she falls ill. Japan won't allow anyone off the ship unless they are being transported to a hospital or have completed at least two weeks in quarantine. U.S. officials have not offered another solution to evacuate American passengers who are anxiously holed up on the cruise liner. 
Mendizabal and her husband, Mario, 75, who are from Crystal River, Fla., feel stranded as they run out of clean clothes and patience.
'We are trying to somehow reach the State Department in hopes they will get us off here,' Vana Mendizabal said in a phone call from the couple's cabin. 'We are confined to our cabins, we're breathing recirculated air, and it's not a healthy environment for us to be staying in.' 
'We just want to get off the ship,' she said. A friend with whom the Mendizabals are traveling learned Thursday that her mother had died back home, news that compounded their group's sense of urgency.
A State Department official said Friday that U.S. officials were closely tracking the situation aboard the ship and that 'once the passengers on the Diamond Princess finish their 14-day quarantine period, they will be permitted to depart Japan on commercial flights, which are readily available, and will not be subject to additional quarantine upon return to the United States.' 
But as the number of sick steadily ticked up to 64 Friday, fears mounted among passengers that the quarantine could potentially expose them to the virus rather than protect them from it.
Japanese officials are investigating how the disease spread on the ship. Late Friday a Japanese official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to be named, told reporters, 'As of now, we haven't seen information that the virus is transmitted by air or . . . by the ventilation system.'
The State Department official said that Japanese officials and cruise employees are doing their best to keep passengers safe and that 'medical consensus and protocols state that the safest and most reliable way to prevent further spread of viral infections on cruise ships is for passengers to shelter in place.'
The outbreak on the ship is believed to have begun when an infected passenger carried the virus onto the ship, later disembarking in Hong Kong. 
Alan Steele, 58, is among the dozens of people aboard the cruise liner who have since learned they have the virus. Steele and his wife, Wendy, married last month and were celebrating their honeymoon with a cruise vacation that has turned into a nightmare. 
'I have been infected and am being transferred to hospital,' Alan Steele said via Facebook Messenger on Friday. 'Must say I am not showing any symptoms at the moment.' 
Wendy, a nurse, is to celebrate her 52nd birthday Tuesday, and her husband was to start a new job Monday. The couple was reluctant to be separated but only Alan tested positive for the virus and disembarked for treatment. 'It was a hard first night without Alan,' Wendy said the next morning. But she added that the pair are in constant communication and that 'Japanese doctors are excellent and he is in safe hands.'
All who tested positive have been or will be taken to local hospitals for treatment. 
Of the most recent 44 found to have the virus, 21 are in their 70s and six are in their 80s, Japan's public broadcaster NHK reported, citing the Ministry of Health. 
Japan's tourism industry has been badly hurt by the epidemic, and fears are mounting that the 2020 Tokyo Olympics could be disrupted. Aside from the 61 cases on the cruise ship, 25 people have tested positive for the virus in Japan. A second ship, the World Dream, is being quarantined in Hong Kong, pending test results and health checks for the 3,800 people aboard, after three passengers who sailed between Jan.-19 and Jan.-24 tested positive. 
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Thursday that foreigners would not be allowed to get off a third cruise ship, the Westerdam, which left Hong Kong on Saturday, except in special circumstances. The country's transport minister on Friday said similar measures would be implemented for other cruise ships if there were fears of infection. 
Aboard the Diamond Princess, the tests were carried out on passengers and crew members deemed at highest risk of having caught the virus after an initial health screening, either because they showed symptoms or because they had interacted with the infected passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong.
The remaining passengers have been issued thermometers to check their own temperatures. And they've been left trying to make the best of a strange situation. The only interactions passengers have with anyone outside their cabins are visits by crew members delivering and removing food trays several times a day. 
Some passengers do not seem to mind. American passengers Matthew Smith and his wife, Katherine Codekas, both 57, said even this experience on the Diamond Princess won't put them off taking another trip. 
'The only thing now is not to think about how much time remains,' Smith said. 'You just kind of take it day by day, moment by moment, and that's not so bad.' 
On Twitter, Smith posted a photo of food that had been delivered to his room: salmon, fresh bread and chocolate cake. 'You might have to drag me off the ship when the quarantine ends,' he wrote, complimenting his feast. 
On Thursday, some passengers were allowed to spend time on a deck so long as they wore masks, kept at least three feet apart and avoided using elevators. They have been given rubber gloves to wear outside their cabins. 
But for some passengers, even just a few days in quarantine seem impossibly long. When the Mendizabals planned their three-week vacation, they did not imagine they would be in for an extra two weeks away from work and home. 
'It's been very disruptive,' Vana Mendizabal said. 'It's very stressful.'

'Wheels up!': Inside the State Dept.'s effort to get Americans out of Wuhan

For two solid weeks, all day and all night, government experts crowded into a narrow room on the top floor of the State Department, peering into computer screens lined up on a huge conference table and noshing from a buffet of sugary and salty snacks.
Their mission was straightforward " to monitor and coordinate the evacuation of hundreds of Americans from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.
But the logistics were in cred ibly complicated. The assembled task force included officers from the Bureau of Consular Affairs to check manifests and passports, China desk hands to communicate with authorities in Wuhan, liaisons from the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services to check manifests and track the flights " and, above all, specialists from the State Department's special crisis medicine unit who kept in touch with health professionals aboard planes as they screened passengers and monitored their conditions.
It all came together Thursday night when the digital clock on the wall, showing the times in Pyongyang, Seoul, Beijing, Moscow, Tehran, Paris and London, turned to 18:40 in Washington.
'Wheels up!' shouted a woman who had been tracking the progress of the first of two Boeing 747s that had just lifted off from the Wuhan airport. The room erupted in whoops and applause from more than a dozen government specialists who had been tensely awaiting that precise moment.
Then they quickly pivoted to tracking the progress of the second aircraft. All passengers aboard. Doors closed. Taxiing. Then, at 7:18 p.m., another jubilant 'Wheels up.'
Some Americans stranded in Wuhan have criticized the U.S. response, saying they found it difficult to sign up for the flights or learn when the next one would leave. Others complained about the approximately $1,000 they have to pay for each seat, saying the price is prohibitively expensive for families. Once back in the United States, many will face 14 days of quarantine on a military base before they can go home.
The flights that left Thursday night were the last of several evacuations carried out in the past week. One chartered plane carrying more than 200 passengers back to the United States arrived last weekend, and two more planes with 350 passengers arrived Wednesday. State Department officials say there may be more in the future, though none are scheduled at the moment.
Steve Biegun, deputy secretary of state, is a member of the interagency Coronavirus Task Force that is leading the U.S. response to the outbreak. A visit to the State Department room, down the hallway from the offices of Biegun and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, offered a glimpse of the undertaking's complexity.
The room is the size of a small conference room. At times, as many as 20 officials have been there at work.
The walls are covered with whiteboards and maps of China, including one showing concentric circles radiating out from Wuhan. A large screen filling a wall at one end of the room alternates between news alerts on the coronavirus to flight-tracking maps. A table covered with potato chips, doughnuts, Twizzlers, rice cakes, cookies, popcorn and nuts has contributed to what the workers call the 'Ops 15,' referring to the number of pounds some of them stand to gain working there.
Some of those seated around the conference table that takes up more than half the room's square footage cross-checked passenger manifests with consular officers from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and consulates elsewhere in China, recruited to help after the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan was evacuated.
Several members of the State Department's operational medicine staff, a unit created to respond to emergencies such as those requiring large-scale evacuations, talked on the phone with William Walters, the unit's director. He was in Wuhan overseeing a staff of medical experts, including EMTs and nurse practitioners. They were suited up in protective clothing and masks as they took passengers' temperatures before boarding, even though they had also been screened by Chinese medics.
Anyone who developed a fever while en route to the United States would have to be isolated from the rest of the passengers in a special section set apart from the main cabin.
As at mission control at NASA, much of the work has a rote feel to it, but every step of progress is announced loudly so everyone in the room can hear.
'Doors are closed and ready to go,' a woman in touch with the pilots said, prompting conversations in the room to drop off as if all were holding their breath until she could verify that the plane was heading down the runway.
A child's voice rose up from a speakerphone in the center of the table. It was from inside the plane.
'There are a lot of children on the plane,' one task-force member said.
In the stilted language of the State Department, protecting the safety and welfare of U.S. citizens is a top priority. As many of the men and women gathered on the seventh floor of the State Department put it Thursday night, 'We're here to help Americans get home.'

Fed Officials Likely to Take Comfort From Jobs Report; Latest employment figures offer little reason for central bank to change make-no-moves stance

The solid January employment report offers another source of comfort for Federal Reserve officials, who shifted to a make-no-moves posture in October after cutting interest rates to prevent a slowdown in manufacturing and trade from dragging down the broader U.S. economy.
Fed officials at their meeting last week held their benchmark federal-funds rate steady in a range between 1.5% and 1.75% and signaled little reason to change course for now.
Friday's hiring report showed employers added 211,000 jobs a month on average over the November-to-January period, up from the monthly average of 175,000 last year. The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.6% last month and average hourly earnings rose 3.1% from a year ago.
As expected, annual revisions to payroll data showed a slower pace of hiring than initially reported for much of 2018 and early 2019. The economy added 193,000 jobs per month in 2018, down from earlier figures that showed 223,000 jobs per month. The upshot is that while hiring slowed last year, the slowdown may not have been as pronounced as originally reported.
Fed officials lowered rates three times last year after raising them four times in 2018 because of fears weaker global demand, amplified by trade uncertainty, might slow the U.S. economy more than expected. They also concluded the economy may not have been as strong in 2018 as initially thought.
Financial markets had been ebullient last month due to a trade truce between the U.S. and China and glimmers of firmer global manufacturing activity. But fears about China's coronavirus outbreak reignited global growth worries last week, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield below 1.6%, its lowest level since October.
While officials are holding rates steady for now, they have signaled they see greater risks of surprises that could prompt them to lower rates than to lift them. The coronavirus is the latest example of such a development.
With inflation holding below the Fed's 2% target, officials have mostly ruled out reversing last year's rate cuts for the foreseeable future. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said he would want to see a persistent and sustained rise in inflation before lifting rates. The Fed staff doesn't forecast this happening for several years.

What to Watch for in Friday's Democratic Debate; New Hampshire event comes as the final results of the Iowa caucuses hang in limbo

Seven Democratic presidential contenders will meet in New Hampshire on Friday, just days before voters in the state go to the polls for the first-in-the-nation primary.
The Democratic National Committee's eighth debate, which will be broadcast on ABC at 8 p.m. ET, comes after the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses culminated in debacle due to inconsistencies in the reporting of results.
The final results of the Iowa caucuses remained in limbo as Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez on Thursday called for a recanvass , or audit of the paper results from each precinct caucus. Iowa Democratic Party officials said the reporting errors were due to a glitch in the mobile app used to report vote totals from roughly 1,700 precincts.
With 100% of precincts reporting, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg's total for state delegate equivalents, the state and national parties' preferred metric, was 564, while Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders had 562. The two leading candidates were separated by less than a 10th of a percentage point, and were followed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
Those candidates will be joined onstage at Saint Anselm College in Manchester by former hedge-fund manager and billionaire Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who will mark his first debate appearance since December.
Here is what we'll be watching for:
Will Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg square off?
Both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg declared victory in the wake of the Iowa caucuses as results showed a virtual tie, teeing up a possible flashpoint in the debate between the liberal senator and more moderate former mayor.
Mr. Buttigieg has pitched a more incremental approach to change compared with Mr. Sanders, whose agenda is rooted in restructuring the nation's economy and health-care system. Those divergent views could take center stage on Friday as Mr. Buttigieg seeks to cast himself as an alternative to Mr. Sanders, whose candidacy has prompted concerns within the establishment and donor class.
Mr. Buttigieg had already begun training his sights on Mr. Sanders in recent weeks, warning voters that "one of the worst risks we can take at a time like this is to recycle the same Washington-style political warfare that brought us to this point."
Will Mr. Biden go on the attack?
Mr. Biden has mostly shied away from confronting his rivals on the debate stage, unless responding to an attack on his own record. But Mr. Biden wasted little time going on the offensive after his disappointing showing in Iowa.
Speaking in New Hampshire on Wednesday, Mr. Biden suggested that every Democrat "will have to carry the label" of socialism if Mr. Sanders is the nominee. He also took aim at Mr. Buttigieg, telling voters it would be "a risk [for Democrats] to nominate somebody who's never held office higher than mayor of a town of 100,000 people in Indiana."
Mr. Biden acknowledged his campaign took "a gut punch" in Iowa . But the former vice president is hoping to turn his campaign around as the contests move to Nevada and South Carolina later this month.
How does Ms. Warren distinguish herself?
The debate could also prove critical for Ms. Warren, who appeared likely to finish third in the Iowa caucuses and is now counting on New Hampshire to reinvigorate her campaign.
Ms. Warren, who represents neighboring Massachusetts, has been pitching herself as the only candidate who can unite the competing factions of the Democratic Party. Those comments suggest Ms. Warren will seek to stay above the fray during Friday night's debate and let the other candidates spar.
That would mark somewhat of a departure from the last debate, in which a feud between Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders over whether a woman could defeat President Trump took an ugly turn. "The way I'm going to win is, I'm going to unite our party, because we have to have a united party," Ms. Warren said in Keene, N.H., on Tuesday. "We can't have a repeat of 2016."
Ms. Klobuchar, who was on track for a fifth-place finish in Iowa, and Mr. Steyer and Mr. Yang also will be looking for renewed attention to their campaigns.
Are the Iowa caucuses dead?
Iowa's influential role in the presidential primaries had already been called into question this cycle, as some critics complained that the relatively small state, with its majority white population, wasn't representative of the broader electorate. The chaos surrounding the caucus results amplified calls to strip Iowa of its status as the first nominating contest in the country.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How will commotion caused by the Iowa caucus results factor into the latest Democratic debate? Join the conversation below.
Democratic presidential candidates have expressed frustration over the outcome in Iowa. Mr. Biden's campaign all but dismissed the credibility of the caucuses. But so far, none of the candidates have called for a recount.
They are likely to be asked Friday whether the caucuses should continue—and whether they will accept the results being reported by the Iowa Democratic Party.
How would candidates address the coronavirus?
The death toll in China from the coronavirus rose to more than 600 this week, and the number of infected cases topped 30,000 nationwide. The majority of the fatalities and new confirmed cases were in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, and surrounding provinces.
Last week, President Trump announced travel restrictions that barred non-U.S. citizens who recently traveled to China from entering the country and imposed a mandatory two-week quarantine on recent U.S. travelers to Hubei province. Those actions were met with concerns from officials at the World Health Organization.
Democratic presidential candidates, who have criticized the Trump administration's response to the fast-spreading disease, might be pressed on how they would confront a similar crisis. Ms. Warren has unveiled a plan to prevent, contain and treat infectious diseases. Mr. Biden, meanwhile, penned an opinion column in which he said Mr. Trump's approach had left the U.S. "unprepared for a dangerous epidemic."

U.S. News: Too Soon to Call Virus's Peak, WHO Says --- U.S. to evacuate more citizens after China reports the most daily deaths yet in outbreak

The World Health Organization said Thursday it was too early to declare a peak in the spread of the coronavirus, a day after China marked its deadliest day since the outbreak began.
Separately, Singapore -- home to the second-largest number of cases outside mainland China -- reported two new infections, including one with no apparent link to China. The city-state warned the public to be "prepared for the possibility of new infection clusters involving locals within the community," and that new cases may not arise from recent travel to China or contact with travelers from there.
Early Friday in China, government authorities raised the death toll from the virus from the virus to 636 from 563. There were 31,161 confirmed illnesses, up from 28,018.
The deaths and new cases have been concentrated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began, and the surrounding province of Hubei, an area of nearly 60 million people that has been quarantined.
Though the number of new cases declined from Wednesday's 3,925, "this is nothing to celebrate -- it's still a great worry," said Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Program, speaking to reporters in Geneva. "It's right now too early to make predictions on numbers."
But Dr. Ryan said it was heartening that the number of cases in Chinese provinces outside of Hubei hadn't accelerated, and that the number of new infections over the prior 24 hours in China had fallen from the previous day.
In Singapore, the two new infections bring the total of confirmed cases to 30, the Ministry of Health said. One of the patients is a 41-year-old citizen who the Health Ministry said had no recent travel history to China. The second is a 27-year-old man who attended a business meeting with people from Hubei and elsewhere in China. Others at the meeting, from South Korea and Malaysia, also tested positive.
Also Thursday, the U.S. State Department offered Americans stranded in Hubei a last chance for evacuation: Two planes, departing as soon as Thursday night, headed for the U.S.
The department told passengers in an email that it expected about 410 people, including Canadians, to be on board. The plan was to drop off Canadians in Vancouver before going to a U.S. destination, which is expected to be in California, it added. Passengers were expected to pay about $1,000 for a ticket.
A separate flight organized by the Canadian government left Wuhan Friday with 176 passengers, Canadian officials said.
As deaths and infections from coronavirus-caused respiratory illnesses rise, governments including the U.S., Taiwan and Japan are taking increasingly aggressive steps to evacuate and quarantine citizens, while companies are scaling back operations in China.
Hundreds of Americans already left Wuhan for home in three government-organized evacuation flights over the past 10 days.
Washington last week raised its travel alert for China to the highest level of "Do Not Travel," and advised Americans in China to consider departing through commercial means.
Singapore also was preparing a second evacuation flight soon, according to people with knowledge of the situation.
WHO announced that it will bring together an international group of scientists and public health experts on Feb. 11 and 12 to identify research priorities and coordinate funding. The aim is to fast-track the development of testing, vaccines and other treatments, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began shipping its diagnostic test kit to labs, hoping to speed up virus detection. Roughly 200 kits will be distributed within the U.S. and a similar amount internationally, the CDC said. Each can run about 700 to 800 patient samples.
Saudi Arabia on Thursday suspended all travel to China for both its citizens and residents. Saudi Arabia's General Directorate of Passports in a statement said citizens who violate the ban would be penalized, while residents wouldn't be allowed back in the kingdom.
Meantime, Japan's health authorities reported 41 new cases of coronavirus infection among people on a cruise liner quarantined near Tokyo, raising the total on the ship to 61.
The ship, carrying around 3,700 passengers and crew, has produced one of the largest clusters of infection with the virus outside China. The outbreak on the ship, the Diamond Princess, is believed to have come from an 80-year-old man who left the vessel midway through a two-week cruise around Asia.
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said 21 of the new cases reported Friday were Japanese passengers. All were to be taken to hospitals on land.

BEIJING -- Chinese President Xi Jinping told President Trump that he had confidence China would win what he called a "people's war" against the deadly coronavirus that has spread from central China around the world.
The remarks, made in a phone call between the two leaders on Friday morning in China, according to the White House and state broadcaster China Central Television, was the first known communication between the two leaders since the World Health Organization last week declared a global public-health emergency around the outbreak.
Mr. Trump expressed confidence in China's strength and resilience in confronting the outbreak, according to the White House, saying the two leaders would be in close communication and cooperation.
The call came as the death toll from the virus rose to more than 630 and the number of infected cases topped 31,000 in mainland China.
Mr. Xi told Mr. Trump that the Chinese government and people were mobilized and fighting hard against the outbreak, which the Chinese leader called a "people's war," according to Chinese state media.
Mr. Xi emphasized his "full confidence" that China could defeat the outbreak with its own capabilities, a possible suggestion that Beijing doesn't anticipate a need to accept large amounts of overseas aid.
Beijing had been publicly criticizing the U.S. for days over its response to the virus, despite working in the background with American authorities and accepting U.S. aid to contain its spread in China.
Almost daily over the past week or so, China's foreign ministry has characterized the U.S. as unfriendly and even antagonistic toward China for decisions such as closing the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected, and urging Americans to avoid travel to the country.
"The US helping China in fighting #nCoV? Seriously?" the foreign ministry's Twitter account said Monday, using a hashtag for the coronavirus.

Natural-Gas Price Slides to a Low in Asia

Liquefied natural gas is fetching the lowest price on record in Asia, a troubling sign for U.S. energy producers who have relied on overseas shipments of shale gas to buoy the sagging domestic market.
The main price gauge for liquefied natural gas, or LNG, in Asia fell to $3 per million British thermal units Thursday, down sharply from more than $20 six years ago as U.S. deliveries have swamped markets around the world.
As recently as Jan. 15, the Asian benchmark, called the Japan Korea Marker, was comfortably above $5. Around then, fear that the coronavirus outbreak would stall economic activity in the world's second-largest economy added to other factors already pressuring prices. Those included a mild winter in Asia, ample local stockpiles and increasing deliveries from U.S. gas-liquefaction facilities.
"The fundamentals were already really weak," said Ira Joseph, head of gas and power analytics at S&P Global Platts, which tracks prices. "The whole market is really oversupplied."
Tumbling LNG prices are cause for concern for a wide swath of energy companies, from major oil companies Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Chevron Corp. to independent firms that operate export terminals, such as Cheniere Energy Inc., and shale-gas producers like Cabot Oil &Gas Corp., Range Resources Corp. and EQT Corp.
A problem for LNG suppliers like these is that power plants in Asia have been slower to switch from burning coal to gas than their U.S. and European peers were when cheap shale gas flooded their local markets, Mr. Joseph said.
"We're not seeing a demand response," he said. "Buyers aren't as nimble."
In the U.S., natural-gas prices fell below $2 per million British thermal units last month and have remained there, a remarkable drop given that prices are typically at their high point in winter, when demand for the heating fuel is high.
Natural-gas futures for March delivery closed Thursday at $1.862 per million British thermal units, down 30% from a year ago despite record consumption by U.S. power plants and a surge in exports, both seaborne and across the border into Mexico via pipelines.
Given that it typically costs about $2 per million British thermal units to liquefy and ship the fuel to Asia, prices there have fallen to a level that makes spot deliveries from the U.S. cost more than what buyers are willing to pay.
LNG prices also have dropped in Europe, where LNG shippers are vying for market share with Russian and Norwegian producers. Gas in European storage facilities is nearly 50% above the five-year average, according to Tudor, Pickering, Holt &Co.
"We're currently modeling flat year-over-year demand in Europe, which will put the onus on Asia to drive global demand growth in 2020," the Houston investment bank wrote in a recent note to clients.
China's near-term gas consumption is in question given the coronavirus quarantines and shutdown of factories, which consume the bulk of the country's imported gas.
But one bright spot for gas demand in Asia could be India, which recently outlined a plan to double the share of energy produced from natural gas to 15% by 2023. Much of the supply needed to meet India's goal will have to come from LNG, Tudor Pickering analysts said.
Meanwhile, U.S. gas producers might have to slow their output. Some producers already have said they would reduce drilling budgets, citing prices that make many wells uneconomical.
So far, production has continued to set new highs despite falling prices.
Analysts at Bernstein Research estimate the floor for U.S. gas prices is around $1.70. At prices below $2.25, producers will likely idle drilling rigs and reduce output, the Bernstein analysts said this week.

Stocks Hit Records as China Cuts Tariffs

Stocks rose after China said it would cut in half tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports, signaling it would follow through with parts of a recently signed trade agreement.
China's Finance Ministry said its decision to cut tariffs was meant to help "alleviate economic and trade frictions" and added that it hoped to work with the U.S. to ultimately eliminate all increased tariffs.
Analysts viewed the move as a positive, given lingering worries about Beijing's ability to deliver on promises made as part of a phase-one trade agreement with the U.S.
"Clearly, the Chinese are trying to get back to business as normal," said Patrick Spencer, managing director of U.S. investment firm Baird.
In addition, the latest flurry of corporate earnings have largely beaten analysts' expectations.
More than half of S&P 500 companies have reported results for the fourth quarter, according to FactSet.
Analysts project that by the time the reporting season is over, companies as a whole will have delivered modest earnings growth -- showing some stabilization following multiple quarters of falling earnings.
"Since 2008, everybody looks around every corner expecting a recession, but the recent earnings numbers really justify the recent strength in the market," Mr. Spencer said. "We needed to see it, and we're getting it."
The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 88.92 points, or 0.3%, to a record 29379.77. The S&P 500 added 11.09 points, or 0.3%, to a record 3345.78, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 63.47 points, or 0.7%, to a record 9572.15.
Twitter shares jumped $5.02, or 15%, to $38.41 after the company posted record revenue for the latest quarter.
Estee Lauder shares rose $10.21, or 5.1%, to $211.53 after the firm reported stronger-than-expected growth in sales for the latest quarter.
Those results helped offset a cut in its profit outlook, which the company attributed to expected fallout from the coronavirus outbreak in China.
The Stoxx Europe 600 advanced 0.4%, boosted by gains among bank shares.
Deutsche Bank rose 13% after the bank disclosed that U.S. fund manager Capital Group had taken a 3.1% stake, one of the larger positions in Germany's biggest bank.
Shares of steelmaker ArcelorMittal jumped 11% after the company beat analysts' expectations for earnings and provided an upbeat outlook.
In Asia, where equity markets have been most hit by concerns over the fast-spreading coronavirus in recent weeks, indexes finished higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, Japan's Nikkei and South Kore's Kospi alll rose more than 2%.
Early Friday, the Nikkei, Hang Seng and Kospi were all lower.

TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. powered through a car-market slowdown and recorded solid profits in its fiscal third quarter, but it cautioned about uncertainty in China caused by the coronavirus outbreak there.
Toyota, the world's largest car maker by market capitalization, recorded operating profit of 654 billion yen (about $5.96 billion) in the October-December quarter, slightly below the year-earlier figure. Quarterly profit would have been nearly $900 million higher than a year ago but for the strengthening yen, the company said.
Operating profit in North America quadrupled in the quarter even though unit sales were slightly down, reflecting Toyota's shift to higher-margin trucks and sport-utility vehicles. Nearly two-thirds of Toyotas sold in the U.S. fit into that category, according to analysts at Jefferies.
In North America, "we are selling more trucks than before because we shifted to more trucks including in our production volume," said Didier Leroy, an executive vice president.
Toyota's relatively healthy performance contrasts with the struggles of U.S. and Japanese competitors including Ford Motor Co., which said this week that its fourth-quarter operating income sank by two-thirds. Subaru Corp.'s operating profit fell 42% in the latest quarter. Lackluster demand in the U.S. and China has hit the industry.
Toyota slightly raised its profit forecast for the current fiscal year, which ends in March, but said it hasn't yet taken into account the possible impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
Masayoshi Shirayanagi, head of public relations, said Toyota factories in China would remain closed until at least Sunday, with a restart date still uncertain.

OPEC
Russia Blocks Deeper
Cuts in Oil Production
Russia rejected a Saudi-led effort to deepen OPEC's oil-production cuts in response to the deadly coronavirus in China, cartel delegates said.
The group's failure to reach a consensus is a setback for OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, and its alliance with Moscow.
Delegates from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia met for three days in an emergency meeting this week to debate a possible response to falling oil demand in China as the world's largest oil importer deals with the coronavirus crisis.
Saudi Arabia had initially backed output cuts of 800,000 to one million barrels a day to balance oil markets. But the gathering collapsed Thursday without an agreement, after the Saudis proposed a compromise cut of 600,000 barrels a day, as a temporary measure in the second quarter. The Russian delegation rejected the proposal on the grounds that it was too early to assess the impact of the virus on global oil demand, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak.

VENEZUELA
U.S. Oil Executives
Moved to Prison
Venezuelan authorities rounded up U.S. oil executives held under house arrest in Caracas and moved them to a prison, the top U.S. envoy to Venezuela told reporters on Thursday.
The six employees of Houston-based Citgo Petroleum Corp. were removed from their homes Wednesday night following a White House meeting between President Trump and Venezuela's opposition leader, Juan Guaido.
Top U.S. envoy Elliott Abrams said the six Citgo employees, who have been detained since 2017 without trial, were believed to have been transferred to Helicoide prison in Caracas.
"We condemn this cruel and indefensible action and demand their long unjust detention come to an end," Mr. Abrams said.
The oil executives have been charged with corruption in Venezuela in connection with a planned $4 billion financing deal with U.S. and Dubai investment funds.
Mr. Abrams described them as political prisoners and called on Venezuela to release them.
The overcrowded Helicoide prison, which is controlled by Venezuela's intelligence police, was the site of a riot in 2018 during which political prisoners recorded cellphone videos to make desperate pleas for help.
Venezuelan officials didn't respond to a request for comment.
Citgo, which is owned by Venezuela, said the company is continuing to support the Trump administration's efforts to secure the release of its employees.

ISRAEL
Violence Erupts in
Jerusalem, West Bank
A Palestinian driver rammed a car into a group of Israeli soldiers in Jerusalem, injuring 14 people, and clashes in the West Bank left two Palestinians dead, one of them a security officer, a week after President Trump unveiled his peace plan for the region.
In separate incidents, an Arab Israeli who shot and wounded an Israeli police officer was killed by police in Jerusalem's Old City, and Israeli soldiers came under fire from an assailant near the town of Qalqilya in the West Bank.
Thursday's flurry of violence came as the Trump administration's long-awaited peace plan continued to amplify tensions between Israelis and Palestinians.
Israel's military said the soldiers struck by the car in Jerusalem earlier Thursday were on a cultural tour of the city. One soldier was seriously hurt in the attack, which also injured two civilians. The Palestinian driver fled but was later apprehended.
Israeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus said the deaths of the two Palestinians in the West Bank city of Jenin occurred as Israeli soldiers were carrying out a court-ordered demolition of a house belonging to a Palestinian convicted of killing an Israeli. Mr. Conricus said the soldiers came under attack by a group of Palestinians throwing Molotov cocktails and sniper fire, and killed a sniper in response.
Mr. Conricus said that it wasn't clear whether the Palestinian security officer who was shot and killed by Israeli soldiers first fired at soldiers or was caught in crossfire and shot accidentally.

IRAQ
Washington to Allow
Some Iran Imports
The U.S. plans to renew a waiver allowing Iraq to import natural gas and electricity from Iran without risking sanctions, U.S. and Iraqi officials said, as Washington and Baghdad move to ease tensions.
Iraq relies heavily on Iranian natural gas for power generation. The Trump administration had previously granted waivers protecting Baghdad from any penalty to avoid plunging the country into crisis on condition the government moved to wean itself off Iranian energy.
But relations between the two allies reached a low after the U.S. in January killed a prominent Iranian commander on Iraqi soil.

World News: Outbreak Strains Market for Medical Masks

Officials in China are buying up medical masks from factories that typically supply hospitals around the world, forcing global manufacturers to boost output in other places and some hospitals to ration supplies.
Masks are essential protective gear for medical workers treating patients potentially infected with the coronavirus. China also is one of the world's top suppliers of medical masks and protective gear.
Now Chinese officials are directing much of the supply to the front lines of the outbreak, leaving customers in the U.S. and other countries to look elsewhere for masks as global supplies tighten.
Medicom Group, a Montreal-based mask maker, said it received a letter from officials in Shanghai ordering it to sell output from its factory there to the local government. "They've got to take care of their people as well," Chief Executive Ronald Reuben said. "It's disruptive, but what can you do?"
Medicom is trying to ramp up production in Shanghai but its workforce has been winnowed by travel restrictions that kept many employees from returning after the Lunar New Year. "They are working around the clock," he said.
The coronavirus has infected more than 31,000 people and killed more than 630. Most cases have appeared in mainland China, but people in more than a dozen other countries, including the U.S., also are sick.
Officials in India and Taiwan have banned exports of medical masks. Medicom, meanwhile, is raising output at mask factories in France and Augusta, Ga., as demand has swelled. The French plant, which typically makes around 170 million masks a year, has orders for 500 million.
3M Co. said the Shanghai municipal government is requiring additional "supervision and control" of some 3M facilities in China because of the outbreak. The local government has taken responsibility for orders and delivery of 3M respirators in Shanghai, company spokeswoman Jennifer Ehrlich said.
The local government in Dongguan is buying all of the masks from a factory owned by Makrite Industries Inc. in the southern Chinese manufacturing hub, that company said. Some of those masks are typically shipped to customers like Home Depot Inc. and Cardinal Health Inc., a medical-device maker and distributor.
"We need to support the government first until it gets better," said Makrite CEO Bob Wen. He said officials were helping Makrite fill travel-related staffing gaps, which have crimped output at the factory. Its typical volume of 160,000 masks a day has fallen to 40,000 a day since the Lunar New Year holiday.
A letter dated Feb. 3 to a manufacturer from China's State Council said the government would buy its entire supply of surgical masks and protective clothing, according to a copy of it reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The letter also said the government would set up a national reserve to absorb any surplus caused by the emergency.
Direct Relief, a Santa Barbara, Calif., nonprofit that provides medical supplies during disasters, is sending air shipments of more than 300,000 masks to hospitals in China.
The medical-grade masks most in demand -- N95 respirators -- block at least 95% of particles and are more advanced than the pleated masks many people wear to prevent the spread of disease. They are typically discarded after one wear. Medical staff treating a typical high-risk patient can go through 50 a day, physicians said.

China to slash tariffs on $75 billion in U.S. goods as virus threatens economy

China said it would halve tariffs on $75-billion of U.S. goods, pressing forward on the first phase of its trade pact with Washington even as the coronavirus outbreak continues to weigh on its economy.
The 'phase one' agreement signed last month quelled the protracted trade conflict that tied up the world's most powerful economies, imperiled global growth and caused chaos for multinational corporations. The terms required both nations to de-escalate some tariffs and compelled China to buy an additional $200-billion in U.S. goods over the next two years.
Levies will be slashed from 10 to 5-percent or from 5 to 2.5-percent on hundreds of U.S. products effective Feb.-14, China's Finance Ministry said. The tariffs on cars, oil, soybeans and other goods date to September and had come in response to additional levies the United States applied in the fall.
The widely expected move comes as China is paralyzed by the coronavirus, which has infected more than 28,000 people in the mainland and killed more than 560. It has also brought China's powerful manufacturing industry to a standstill as travel restrictions freeze the country's workforce and major companies such as Boeing, Apple and Nike have been forced to close factories until at least mid-February. McDonald's, Starbucks, KFC, Levi Strauss, H-M and Samsung have closed stores across China. Casinos in Macao, the world's biggest gambling market, are shutting down for two weeks.
'The recent cut in Chinese tariffs is more about containing the economic damage to China from the coronavirus than it is about trade relations between the two countries,' Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said in commentary Thursday. 'Along with the recent moves by the [People's Bank of China] to inject money to protect their markets, this is aimed at managing the risk.'
China is the world's leading oil consumer, and the country's lockdown has sent shock waves through crude markets. Brent crude prices hit a one-year low this week, and BP has warned that the virus could reduce global oil demand by as much as 40-percent this year. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies have been meeting to discuss oil output in the face of declining demand.
Even if the virus is contained soon, economists are predicting China's growth rate will fall to between 3 and 4-percent this quarter.
'The Chinese government is facing a number of homegrown problems, the major one being the outbreak of the coronavirus,' said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. 'They need our food. Food inflation is soaring in China. There have also been disruptions in their transportation system, further complicating the food supply.'
China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs announced an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus that wiped out 4,500 birds on a poultry farm in the Hunan province this week. The World Health Organization said that the H5N1 virus 'does not infect humans easily' and that the person-to-person spread is unusual. But H5N1 compounds the dangers for China's poultry industry, as the coronavirus has made it difficult for farmers to receive chicken feed. Poultry farmers in Hubei province, the center of the coronavirus outbreak, said last week they were 'very distressed' about the situation in a letter to the China Animal Agriculture Association.
Experts are skeptical about China's ability to deliver on the additional $200-billion in purchases, and the likelihood seems slimmer given the outbreak. But the pact allows for some leniency in the event of 'market conditions.' The United States is slated to follow suit and cut tariffs on certain Chinese imports from 15 to 7.5-percent, also Feb.-14.
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said Wednesday that the United States should be patient with China if it struggles to hit these targets amid the outbreak, the Reuters news agency reported.
'If they're really trying, and it really just blows the economy out of the water, then we would have to be understanding of that,' Perdue said, speaking to reporters at a cattle convention in Texas.
Farmers were among those hit hardest by the trade war, and the U.S. government has tried to stem the losses with a $28-billion bailout. American farm bankruptcies jumped 20-percent in 2019, hitting an eight-year high, according to recent analysis from the American Farm Bureau Federation.
Fresh data from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed that the U.S. trade deficit with China narrowed in 2019 for the first time in three years, as both nations slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of imports. The deficit with China fell $73.9-billion to $345.6-billion last year.
'China hopes that both sides will abide by bilateral agreements and make an effort to implement relevant provisions so that we can boost market confidence, promote bilateral trade relations and global economic growth,' China's Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council said in a statement.
The sign of de-escalation lifted overseas markets, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closing up 2.5-percent and Europe's benchmark Stoxx 600 index on track for its best week of trading since 2016.

Africa takes steps to accelerate testing capacity

DAKAR, Senegal " After Africa's first suspected case of the Wuhan coronavirus emerged last month in the Ivory Coast, doctors sent a sample from the coughing college student to the closest equipped lab " 4,500 miles north, in Paris.
Officials said the wait for the results, which came back negative, highlighted the need to rapidly expand testing capacity on the continent, where health authorities are scrambling to prepare for a potential outbreak.
No cases have been confirmed so far in any of Africa's 54 countries, but the risk of an outbreak is high, World Health Organization leaders say. Africa is home to 1.2-billion people, including an estimated 1-million Chinese nationals, who tend to work in business, construction, oil and mining " a testament to Beijing's increasingly tight relationship with Senegal, Nigeria, Ethiopia and beyond.
Flights from the Asian power bring at least 1,000 travelers to the continent each day. But as of this week, only six labs could test for the coronavirus. (In the United States, all cases were tested at the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta until Wednesday, when test kits were sent to more than 100 state labs.) 
'Our greatest concern is about the potential for spread in countries with weaker health systems' that lack the capacity to detect the virus, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday. 
To address that concern, medical teams from 15 African nations convened in Dakar on Thursday for an emergency workshop on the first layer of readiness: diagnosing the new virus. WHO officials said 24 countries, encompassing most of Africa's population, would receive the material needed to conduct the tests by the end of the week.
'We can do a test in four hours,' said Amadou Alpha Sall, general administrator of the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, the region's top biomedical research facility, 'and our goal is to spread that capability.'
The lab was one of only two on the continent that had testing capabilities before Nigeria, Ghana, Madagascar and Sierra Leone received the supplies this week, the WHO said. (The other one was in South Africa.)
The WHO has fielded dozens of alerts about possible infections from 20 African countries since late January. African governments are rushing to ramp up their preparedness, including by building isolation wards, but more specialized training is needed to address a new and fast-spreading problem. 
The infection count in China has risen to more than 31,000 cases " including more than 4,800 considered critical and about 70 new deaths on Thursday alone, bringing the death toll to at least 637. 
More than 190 cases have been counted in 24-countries, including the United States, Canada and Australia.
As the United States denies entry to foreign nationals coming from China, and as European nations impose varying levels of travel restrictions, countries across Africa are deploying less stringent tactics.
Countries with large numbers of travelers arriving from China are screening at airports with thermal monitors and isolating anyone who shows symptoms. 
Mozambique stopped issuing visas for Chinese nationals. South Africa's postal service no longer accepts packages from China. Six African airlines halted flights they have deemed hazardous, but Ethiopian Airlines has maintained 17 weekly flights to four Chinese cities, not including Wuhan.
In a global ranking last October of 195 countries on their level of preparedness for a 'biological threat' by experts at Johns Hopkins University, African nations ranked toward the bottom of the list " with Equatorial Guinea placing last.
'I still think there are places that are flat-out bald in parts of Africa where the coronavirus could just race through,' said J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
Sall, head of the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, disputed such characterizations.
'It's not right to say Africa is the most vulnerable and least prepared,' he said. 'That's based on how they see Africa and not on what's actually happening.'
Police stopped two Chinese business executives at Senegal's border with Gambia last week. No thermal cameras greeted the visitors, who had arrived days earlier from Beijing. No one quarantined them. And no one panicked.
'Police took their addresses and phone numbers,' said El Hadji Mamadou Ndiaye, head of prevention at Senegal's Ministry of Health. 'We're checking in with them every day for 14-days, and if any sign of the virus arrives, we're ready for it.'
Thirty-eight others who have entered the West African country from China since Jan.-28 have received the same treatment of daily phone calls and doctor visits.
'We can't afford quarantine,' Ndiaye said. 'So we track their whereabouts. If they show even the slightest sign, we come and pick them up.'
A college student who returned to Dakar from China last week with a fever and a cough was tested and cleared, he said, in one afternoon.
Hanging over the response to the coronavirus is the memory of the Ebola epidemic that killed roughly 11,000 people in West Africa from 2014 to 2016. 
Doctors know to report cases sooner, Sall said, and quickly share information across borders. Authorities are in regular contact with the WHO, the Africa CDC and Chinese worker associations.
Governments have launched campaigns to educate people about coronavirus symptoms and what to do if they manifest, but authorities have kept a tighter lid on medical data.
Senegalese health officials declined to say how many samples the Institut Pasteur has tested and from which countries. 
Cities across sub-Saharan Africa " thought to be the fastest-growing region on Earth " are densely crowded, which elevates the risk for respiratory contagion, experts say.
Multiple outbreaks are ongoing in other parts of Africa, including simultaneous Ebola and measles outbreaks in eastern Congo. If the coronavirus were to arrive in Africa, some resources probably would have to be diverted away from the response in Congo, complicating already fraught efforts there.
Congo's Health Ministry is generally regarded as competent at containing outbreaks, but health workers have been repeatedly targeted by Congo's numerous militias, as well as locals suspicious of the motives behind the WHO's large-scale intervention.
The Ebola outbreak has infected nearly 3,500 and killed 2,250.

HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam " The extended shutdown of Chinese factories from the coronavirus outbreak is upsetting supply chains as manufacturers feel the pinch from shortages of material and travel restrictions.
In Vietnam, which shares an 800-mile border with China and is home to many businesses that export to the United States, companies say the squeeze is compounding pressure caused by President Trump's trade war with Beijing.
Despite Vietnam's close economic and tourism ties with China, the human cost of the coronavirus outbreak in this country of nearly 100 million remains small, with 12 confirmed infections. But for companies with Chinese staff, or those reliant on materials and equipment from China, the pain is real.
Kaiser Furniture, a Taiwanese-owned manufacturer that has operated in Vietnam since 2004, falls into both of those categories. The company, which sells 95 percent of its furniture to the United States, has over 3.2 million square feet of production facilities and roughly 5,000 employees in Binh Duong province, a heavily industrialized region outside Ho Chi Minh City.
Dwayne Wood, Kaiser's general manager of sales and marketing, says 120 of its workers are from mainland China, 50 of whom are trapped in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. The employees had been visiting home for the Lunar New Year holiday when the virus began to spread rapidly, prompting Chinese authorities to place Hubei under an unprecedented lockdown.
'They are all senior and middle managers,' Wood said. 'Our production scheduling guys, our entire costing department. A couple of our purchasing people and two senior managers at our upholstery area are stuck, so we're having to move things around to be able to get those areas to work.'
Other Chinese employees of Kaiser were able to return to Vietnam before flights between the two countries were suspended last weekend. Now, Vietnam is no longer granting new visas to Chinese nationals, and anyone arriving in the country who has been in China within the last two weeks faces 14 days in quarantine.
While travel restrictions have created personnel problems, Wood said, broader issues are gaining prominence.
'The bigger impact for us is that China really just hasn't started back up [since the end of the holiday], and China is such a huge trading partner, and we still rely heavily on them for a lot of our component parts,' he said.
Furniture production for the U.S. market is well-established in Vietnam, with large-scale manufacturing dating back two decades. 
While Vietnam's economy has diversified and grown rapidly in recent years, driven in part by rising labor costs in China, businesses still rely on the huge Chinese industrial sector to churn out essential components. For Kaiser, that means parts such as drawer guides and specific fabrics or leather.
'The biggest disruption of the coronavirus for a lot of people here will be how it affects the supply chain. It was already a stretch with Lunar New Year; our customers placed extra orders early to compensate for the break. . . . But now we're back, and we're trying to contact our vendors in China, and they're not even back to work,' Wood said.
Others in Vietnam say they have not felt the full force of disruptions but worry that it's only a matter of time.
An executive at a large American footwear company based in Ho Chi Minh City said that while the business is not experiencing problems yet, managers are monitoring the supply chain closely.
'A lot of the athletic brands have already started moving out of China, but a lot of technical materials, whether knits or carbon plates, things like that, haven't completely migrated out of China yet,' said the manager, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
These parts are largely produced in Guangdong province, home to the industrial powerhouses of Shenzhen and Guangzhou, a region that so far has avoided significant disruptions from the outbreak. Nonetheless, the footwear producer is exploring contingency plans with other suppliers. Its factories outside Ho Chi Minh City have distributed masks and hand sanitizer to workers, while also quarantining Chinese employees for 14 days.
The footwear firm is not alone in taking such a step. The labor department in Ho Chi Minh City has ordered 187 companies to keep 1,069 Chinese employees in quarantine for two weeks.
New restrictions within China could further stress production lines. 
'We've also heard that Hangzhou is telling factories they can't open until March 1, and that's a really key fabric area,' Wood said. 'If that happens, then we'll be greatly affected.'
Although China has largely weathered Trump's trade war, economists expect its annual growth to slump to below 4 percent for the first quarter as services halt and consumers avoid going out due to contagion fears.
'The tariffs have had a great impact on the exodus of manufacturing from China, but it's been kind of a slow death, whereas if something like this happens where they're physically not able to go back to work, it really forces people to quickly change their mind-set and move away from China at a much faster pace,' Wood said.

Stocks Surge as Airlines Lead Way

Stocks rallied, largely erasing the losses sparked by reaction to China's coronavirus outbreak, while oil prices posted their biggest gain in more than a month.
Investors have cheered quarterly earnings and growth projections from the world's largest companies in recent days as well as signs that the manufacturing sector in the U.S. and Europe may be stabilizing.
Concerns about the deadly virus have faded in the absence of immediate signs that the disruption to businesses in China could affect other nations.
"The story in the market is the repricing of the virus fear," said Peter Schaffrik, a global macro strategist at RBC Capital Markets. "What people are currently looking at is the rate of spread of the outbreak: The number of cases is still going up, but the growth rate is slowing down."
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 483.22 points, or 1.7%, to 29290.85. The S&P 500 advanced 37.10 points, or 1.1%, to 3334.69. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index rose 40.71 points, or 0.4%, to 9508.68.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed at records, while the Dow closed just 0.2% below its mid-January closing high.
The rally continued abroad early Thursday. At midday in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average was up 2.1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 1.7%, the Shanghai Composite was up 0.4% and South Kore's Kospi was up 1.9%.
Data released Wednesday showed the U.S. nonfarm private sector added 291,000 jobs in January, beating expectations of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal, who anticipated a gain of 150,000 jobs. Most of the growth was at small and medium-size businesses, according to the ADP National Employment Report.
An upsurge in volatility in equity markets also showed signs of abating, with the Cboe Volatility Index, a closely watched measure of stock swings, dropping for a third straight day. The index, known as the VIX, closed at 15.15, down 5.6% from Tuesday.
Futures on Brent crude, the global benchmark for oil, rose 2.4% to settle at $55.28 a barrel, following a four-day losing streak. U.S. oil futures climbed 2.3% to $50.75 a barrel. The gains were the biggest for both benchmarks since Jan. 3.
Airline stocks, battered by virus-related travel disruptions, were among the winners. United Airlines Holdings rose $2.96, or 3.8%, to $81.85. American Airlines Group gained 67 cents, or 2.4%, to $29.10.
Tesla shares sank $152.36, or 17%, to $734.70, reversing course after they surged 56% over the previous week. The drop, the largest one-day percentage decrease in Tesla since 2012, followed an analyst downgrade and news that the electric-car maker's deliveries in China would be delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Ford Motor shares tumbled 87 cents, or 9.5%, to $8.31. The car maker reported its fourth-quarter results after hours Tuesday, saying operating income plunged by two-thirds and missed analysts' estimates.
Snap slid $2.79, or 15%, to $16.19 after it reported revenue that missed estimates. Match Group, owner of the Tinder app, lost $6.93, or 8.4%, to $76 after missing estimates on revenue-per-user metrics.

Tech Licensing Boosts Qualcomm's Revenue

Qualcomm Inc. said revenue rose 5% in its first fiscal quarter, as stronger sales of smartphones bolstered its technology-licensing business, though the spread of the coronavirus could take some shine away from a year that includes many high-end phone launches.
The San Diego-based company, which designs and markets semiconductors mostly for mobile-communications equipment, on Wednesday said sales were $5.08 billion in the quarter ended in December, up from $4.84 billion a year ago.
Profit fell 13% to $925 million, or 80 cents a share. The previous year's first quarter included a more than half-billion-dollar tax benefit recorded from U.S. tax law changes.
On an adjusted basis, earnings fell to 99 cents, though that figure came in higher than analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected.
Like its peers in the cellphone supply chain, Qualcomm grappled with lower global smartphone sales last year.
Many consumers are waiting to purchase new handsets to take advantage of superfast fifth-generation cell networks that operators are building out. But Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said Qualcomm was reaping early gains from the rollout of 5G networks.
Even though the company forecasts selling fewer cellphone chips this quarter, partly as the result of seasonal fluctuations, it is expecting to make more money per chip as the year progresses.
Finance chief Akash Palkhiwala said cellphone makers are dedicating resources to introducing new high-end phones, including 5G smartphones for which Qualcomm makes more expensive chips.
Part of that upswing will likely come from Apple Inc., which Qualcomm reached a chip-supply agreement with last year after settling a long-running licensing dispute. Qualcomm chips are widely expected to go into Apple's first 5G-capable phones when they are introduced, likely in September.
Apple also provided a boost to Qualcomm during the last three months of 2019, when it reported bumper sales of its latest iPhones. Qualcomm collects royalties from patents it licenses to Apple and other handset makers.
Qualcomm's licensing arm generated $1.4 billion in sales in the quarter, up 38% from a year ago as Apple resumed royalty payments following their legal settlement. Qualcomm's chip division's sales fell 3%.
Risks lie on the horizon, however. Qualcomm has yet to resolve a licensing dispute with Huawei Technologies Co., after it reached an interim agreement with the Chinese telecom giant in late 2018 under which Huawei made $150 million quarterly payments to Qualcomm. That agreement has since expired, with no indication that it will be renewed.
Qualcomm has also started to see a decrease in orders of chips from customers in China as a result of the outbreak of coronavirus there, Mr. Palkhiwala said in an interview. Manufacturers have been bracing for supply-chain disruption as the virus spreads, with the number of confirmed cases rising above 24,000 as of Tuesday.
China accounts for around a quarter of global smartphone demand, UBS analysts estimate, and Qualcomm is a key supplier of chips to many Chinese handset makers.
The company cut the low-end of its earnings guidance out of an abundance of caution, Mr. Palkhiwala said, although there has only been a small decline in its orders so far. Qualcomm expects adjusted earnings to be between 80 cents and 95 cents a share in the current quarter, with Wall Street analysts forecasting 86 cents a share.
Qualcomm said chip shipments could fall to between 125 million and 145 million in the second fiscal quarter, from 155 million in the first quarter.
Qualcomm also disclosed it is under investigation in the European Union over whether it engaged in anticompetitive behavior related to its 5G radio-frequency technologies. Qualcomm said it didn't believe it was violating EU competition rules. The company has been caught in a legal tangle for years over allegations that it leveraged its dominance as a supplier of cellphone chips that manage communications with cell towers to extract unfair patent-licencing terms.

World News: Cruise Passengers Quarantined on Board

TOKYO -- As the 116,000-ton cruise liner Diamond Princess started chugging toward Yokohama earlier this week, passengers savored the last few days of an Asian journey at buffet restaurants, theaters and the ship's nightclub.
Then came the two-week lockdown.
An 80-year-old man who left the vessel in Hong Kong earlier in the trip had tested positive for the coronavirus that has killed more than 500 people and infected more than 28,000 others around the world. Japanese authorities quarantined the ship and found 10 other people with the virus who were sent to hospitals back on land.
On Thursday, Japan's health ministry said an additional 10 people on the ship were confirmed to have the virus and would be taken to hospitals.
The rest now face two more weeks holed up on the ship -- the quarantine period for the virus -- worrying about infection and scrambled travel plans. About 3,700 passengers and crew are on board.
Passengers were startled from their slumber around 6:30 a.m. Wednesday by a broadcast telling them to remain in their rooms. Later, the captain announced: "The ship is under quarantine and it is expected to last at least 14 days." Crew members in protective medical gear fanned out to wipe doorknobs and other surfaces with disinfectant.
Rebecca Frasure, a 35-year-old passenger from Forest Grove, Ore., said her husband noticed some movement in the hall when someone tried to get ice. The passenger was asked by a crew member to return to his room and told that ice would be delivered.
Mrs. Frasure said she and her husband are worried about their prescription drugs running out before they are released from quarantine.
"We both brought just enough to see us through," said Mrs. Frasure. In an announcement later Wednesday, the crew said they would collect requests from passengers for prescription medication.
A similar scene is also playing out in Hong Kong. About 3,600 passengers and crew on a cruise ship haven't been allowed to disembark as planned Wednesday pending health checks, a city official said, after eight passengers who took a previous trip on the ship were confirmed to have the virus.
The coronavirus threatens to deal a blow to the cruise industry, which attracts travelers across Asia, the center of the viral outbreak. Princess Cruises, the operator of the Diamond Princess, said it has canceled two other cruises from Japan, while Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. said on Tuesday it would cancel eight cruises out of China.
Princess Cruises said it was working to keep all guests comfortable and was bringing supplies onboard. The ship was scheduled to arrive in Yokohama Thursday after a detour to dump wastewater.
Tammy Smith, a 73-year-old retired elementary school principal from California, has had to cancel a tour of Tokyo and Kyoto and her flights to the U.S. "We can't make plans now until we know more about when we will get off the ship," she said.
Adding to the uncertainty, dozens of test results for passengers weren't yet available and Japan's health ministry said further testing would continue. Among the people confirmed to have the virus who have been brought to shore for treatment are passengers from the U.S., Australia, Japan and Hong Kong, as well as a Filipino crew member, according to Princess Cruises.
The first passenger to contract the virus left the ship on Jan. 25. When the ship arrived in Okinawa on Feb. 1, several passengers were found to have a fever but none said they had been to Wuhan, nor had they had contact with people from the central Chinese city, and the cruise was allowed to continue. On Feb. 2, the captain was told the first passenger had been confirmed to have the virus. The ship was put under quarantine on Feb. 3.

Trade Deficit Narrows For First Time Since '13

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in 2019 for the first time in six years as disputes with China and other countries reduced the U.S.'s exports and imports while reshaping relationships with economic partners.
Exports declined last year for the first time since 2016, dropping 0.1%, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. But imports fell more sharply, decreasing 0.4%. That combination shrank the overall trade deficit 1.7%, to $616.8 billion.
Meantime, China lost its rank as the top U.S. trade partner, falling to third place behind Mexico and Canada. And the U.S.'s total trade in goods rose faster with Vietnam than with any of its largest trading partners, while trade with China fell most rapidly.
The shifting trade picture dinged the U.S. economy but didn't take a big toll. The economy grew 2.3% last year, down from 2.9% in 2018 but in line with the average pace that has marked the expansion that began in mid-2009.
"Most of the trade fluctuations we saw in 2019 were short-term timing things," such as businesses rushing to get imports in before anticipated tariff increases, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.
"The big-picture implications [of trade policy] are probably only going to show up in a period of several years," he said.
China felt the brunt of a trade war last year. The U.S. deficit in goods with China fell 17.6%, to its smallest level since 2014.
Meanwhile, Vietnam saw a jump in U.S. trade as companies looked for ways around the U.S. and China fight.
Wednesday's data marked the end to a year that saw trade disputes escalate in the early months and conclude with agreements that eased tensions.
The U.S. and China last month signed a deal that amounts to a cease-fire in their two-year trade war, though it leaves in place tariffs on about $370 billion in Chinese goods. The report also predates the coronavirus outbreak that threatens to disrupt travel and global supply chains in the months ahead.
The U.S. economy has run trade deficits for decades, during both economic expansions and recessions, which economists say reflects the fact that people in the U.S. consume more than they produce relative to the rest of the world. To turn a trade deficit into a surplus, the U.S. would need to import less and export more products and services.
Economists generally play down the significance of trade gaps between countries.
Many economists have said that a large trade deficit reflects a dearth of national savings, though they generally disagree with the view that a deficit is a measure of a nation's overall financial or economic success. Faster-growing economies can run large deficits, and vice versa.
U.S. consumers and businesses receive goods and services in return for money they send overseas for imports.
But it is a measure the Trump administration has used as a scorecard. President Trump placed tariffs on imports, particularly from China, in the hopes of giving U.S. producers an edge and narrowing a deficit he has described as bad for the economy.
The trade deficit expanded in recent years partly because the U.S. economy was growing faster than the rest of the world. People in the U.S. with higher incomes bought more imported goods. A smaller deficit due to falling imports and exports can portend weaker demand, which is a potentially negative sign for the economy.
Other factors such as last year's grounding of Boeing Co.'s 737 MAX jetliner have scrambled U.S. export data. Exports of civilian aircraft declined 22.2% last year as exports of industrial supplies and capital goods fell overall.
In December, the foreign-trade gap in goods and services expanded 11.9% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted $48.88 billion. Exports rose 0.8% but imports increased by a greater amount, rising 2.7% from November.
December's growth in imports came after three straight months of decline. In mid-December, Mr. Trump, a Republican, agreed to a limited trade pact with Beijing that rolled back existing tariff rates on Chinese goods and canceled new levies that were set to take effect that month.
Businesses have largely welcomed the trade rapprochement with China as a step in the right direction.
Jim Fitterling, chief executive of materials-science company Dow Inc., said last week that "recent trade resolutions should be a positive for sentiment, but it may take some time before we see this translate into improved fundamentals."
"Even after the phase one U.S.-China agreement, a majority of the original tariffs are still in place, which will continue to weigh on supply chain as well as consumer and investor sentiment," he said during an earnings call Jan. 29.
Brian Newman, chief financial officer at United Parcel Service Inc., said last week that the delivery company's outlook for 2020 "reflects forecasted year-over-year declines in U.S. industrial production and other global softness. However, there is growing optimism due to the recent trade agreements that could move us higher."
Overall, the U.S. economy appears to be growing steadily, having weathered a global slowdown and geopolitical uncertainty last year.
Payroll processor ADP said private-sector payrolls rose 291,000 last month, eclipsing expectations for a 150,000 increase and a sign that the labor market remains healthy. Also Wednesday, two business surveys pointed to accelerating activity in the U.S. services sector last month, the latest sign that the economy has found its footing.
The Institute for Supply Management said its nonmanufacturing survey rose in January to its highest level since August, while IHS Markit, another private data provider, said its services index also rose last month.
Trade did boost the U.S. economy in the fourth quarter, with net exports adding 1.48 percentage point to the overall 2.1% growth rate in GDP, in part due to a sharp drop in imports. Economists don't expect that to continue into 2020.
"We expect net external trade to be closer to neutral in the first quarter of this year, but a lot depends on how the situation in China develops," said Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics in a note to clients, referring to the coronavirus outbreak and the broader state of the bilateral trade relationship.
"If the closure of factories persists for an extended period then that could hit U.S. imports toward the end of the first quarter," he said.

The airport was a 16-hour overnight vigil of lines and paperwork and stress and delays, of squawking children and the worried well, all trying to board the same two planes. 
Ningxi Xu's name was on the list. But until the converted cargo plane was rising into the sky over Wuhan, China, she couldn't be certain she would be one of the lucky Americans to escape the center of the coronavirus outbreak and make it back home.
With a blue band fastened around her right wrist, she became passenger 199, took her seat with her government-issue boxed lunch and face mask, and left on one of the two flights that landed in California on Wednesday. 
One flight delivered 178-people to Travis Air Force Base outside Sacramento. The other landed there, then went on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, where about 170-people exited. Two more flights are leaving Wuhan and arriving in the United States on Thursday. An additional 195-people who arrived Jan.-28 are quarantined at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, Calif.
Wednesday's evacuees face 14-days of quarantine in hotels on the military bases, as authorities wait to see whether anyone has the virus. A patient in Wisconsin tested positive for it, bringing the total in the United States to 12 as the global toll grew to 563-people dead and more than 27,000-ill in the health crisis spreading out of China. 
The extended confinement is unwelcome, passengers said, but people seem to be taking it in stride.
'Most people were just glad to be getting out of there,' Xu said from her hotel room at Miramar. There were 'a lot of kids and parents and grandparents.'
'At this point, I'm just happy to be in the States,' said Chunlin Leonhard, a law professor from New Orleans who is quarantined at the Travis base. 'I haven't thought about much else.'
Each flight appeared to have at least one sick person aboard. On Leonhard's plane, officials said, a small child with a fever was isolated in the rear of the craft in an area blocked off with plastic sheeting. Xu said she saw a woman in a similar place on her flight. The woman did not appear to be aboard for the final leg to Miramar. 
Wearing protective suits and masks, government workers moved about the planes during the 12-hour flight, taking the passengers' temperatures twice. They were also screened before they boarded and again as they left the planes.
Xu, who is from New Jersey, was called to the front of the plane when her temperature rose slightly. Other passengers shied away as she made her way up the aisle, she said. But her temperature stayed within the normal range and she was allowed to proceed to the hotel.
Henry Walke, a doctor with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who is in charge of the evacuees' care during the quarantine at Travis, said the first families to leave the plane were applauded by government personnel who greeted them, an emotional scene that highlighted the passengers' relief. 
'They're glad to be here. They've been through a lot, and we're going to do everything possible to care for them,' he said.
This is the first quarantine ordered by federal health officials in more than 50-years, and the CDC is having to improvise. Each family has a private room but is being told to keep some distance " at least six feet " from other families. The children will be told not to share toys. 
'We want to maintain some social distances between family units, but at the same time we are not restricting people to their rooms. So it's a delicate balance,' Walke said.
Many plans are still fluid, said Christopher Braden, the CDC infectious-disease doctor who briefed reporters at Miramar. 'This mission changes . . . not by the day, by the hour,' Braden said.
With many employees of the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan previously evacuated, Wednesday's travelers said they were left on their own to secure a seat on the flight, make their way through locked-down Wuhan to the airport, and find the flight in the confusion there.
For Ken Burnett's family, it was just the latest harrowing chapter in a month of worry. It started as a getaway vacation for his wife, with Burnett staying behind in San Diego to work while Yanjun Wei took 3-year-old Rowan and Mia, 1, to visit her family in Wuhan for the Lunar New Year. Burnett was supposed to join them later in Hong Kong and they would fly back to gether.
Then the coronavirus struck, and Wuhan came to a standstill. Wei and the children were trapped in a relative's apartment with her Chinese parents for a month. As their supplies dwindled, Wei's mother would venture out every few days to try to find food, including fresh vegetables.
'As a father it's just the worst feeling you can imagine,' Burnett said. 'The thing you want most in the world is to say, 'It's going to be okay; I'm coming over to get you guys.' And instead I'm stuck here, helpless.' 
The U.S. government originally promised Wei and the children seats on a chartered plane that was supposed to leave Saturday, but that flight was canceled at the last moment.
To make Wednesday's flight, Wei had to find her way through multiple checkpoints and police roadblocks.
Burnett said his wife later told him that she reached a breaking point on the plane and sought help from other passengers and medical staff. 
Leonhard and another American took an eerie four-hour drive from Songzi City to Wuhan airport to get out. For hours they were the only car on the freeway, she said, with trucks taking supplies to the idled city. 
She was told to be at the airport by 6 p.m. Tuesday for a 10 p.m. flight. She arrived early, determined not to miss her chance. The plane did not take off until 8 the next morning.
With no U.S. officials to guide them, the evacuees organized themselves over the WeChat app. At one point, they were divided in half by the first letter of their last names, which caused chaos when it separated families. Chinese children don't always have the same last name as both of their parents.
'It was pretty chaotic,' Leonhard said. 'The embassy did not have enough people. It's clear that they didn't have the crowd-management team on hand, and it was clear they didn't think through the crowd management.' 
Xu said: 'People didn't really want to talk to strangers because they didn't want to risk contagion. I was just really frustrated.' 
'It's actually more dangerous to be there than outside in the street,' she added, noting that there were hundreds of people 'sitting there next to each other.' 
Finally they boarded and took off for two weeks as guests of the U.S. government. The evacuees must keep a log of their temperatures and will be taken to hospitals if they develop symptoms.
'It's going to be a long 14-days,' Burnett said of his wait to see his quarantined family. 'But at least now I know they're safe. It'll be an easier 14-days than the past 14, for sure.'

Qualcomm Reports Higher Revenue, Issues Mixed Outlook; Like its peers, chip maker grappled with lower global smartphone sales last year

Qualcomm Inc. said revenue rose 5% in its first fiscal quarter, as stronger sales of smartphones bolstered its technology-licensing business, though the spread of the coronavirus could take some shine away from a year that includes many high-end phone launches.
The San Diego-based company, which designs and markets semiconductors mostly for mobile-communications equipment, on Wednesday said sales were $5.08 billion in the quarter ended in December, up from $4.84 billion a year ago.
Profit fell 13% to $925 million, or 80 cents a share. The previous year's first quarter included a more than half-billion-dollar tax benefit recorded from U.S. tax law changes.
On an adjusted basis, earnings fell to 99 cents, though that figure came in higher than analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected.
Like its peers in the cellphone supply chain, Qualcomm grappled with lower global smartphone sales last year.
Many consumers are waiting to purchase new handsets to take advantage of superfast fifth-generation cell networks that operators are building out. But Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said Qualcomm was reaping early gains from the rollout of 5G networks.
Even though the company forecasts selling fewer cellphone chips this quarter, partly as the result of seasonal fluctuations, it is expecting to make more money per chip as the year progresses.
Finance chief Akash Palkhiwala said cellphone makers are dedicating resources to introducing new high-end phones, including 5G smartphones for which Qualcomm makes more expensive chips.
Part of that upswing will likely come from Apple Inc., which Qualcomm reached a chip-supply agreement with last year after settling a long-running licensing dispute. Qualcomm chips are widely expected to go into Apple's first 5G-capable phones when they are introduced, likely in September.
Apple also provided a boost to Qualcomm during the last three months of 2019, when it reported bumper sales of its latest iPhones. Qualcomm collects royalties from patents it licenses to Apple and other handset makers.
Qualcomm's licensing arm generated $1.4 billion in sales in the quarter, up 38% from a year ago as Apple resumed royalty payments following their legal settlement. Qualcomm's chip division's sales fell 3%.
Risks lie on the horizon, however. Qualcomm has yet to resolve a licensing dispute with Huawei Technologies Co., after it reached an interim agreement with the Chinese telecom giant in late 2018 under which Huawei made $150 million quarterly payments to Qualcomm. That agreement has since expired, with no indication that it will be renewed.
Qualcomm has also started to see a decrease in orders of chips from customers in China as a result of the outbreak of coronavirus there, Mr. Palkhiwala said in an interview. Manufacturers have been bracing for supply-chain disruption as the virus spreads, with the number of confirmed cases rising above 24,000 as of Tuesday.
China accounts for around a quarter of global smartphone demand, UBS analysts estimate, and Qualcomm is a key supplier of chips to many Chinese handset makers.
The company cut the low-end of its earnings guidance out of an abundance of caution, Mr. Palkhiwala said, although there has only been a small decline in its orders so far. Qualcomm expects adjusted earnings to be between 80 cents and 95 cents a share in the current quarter, with Wall Street analysts forecasting 86 cents a share.
Qualcomm said chip shipments could fall to between 125 million and 145 million in the second fiscal quarter, from 155 million in the first quarter.
The company forecast sales of $4.9 billion to $5.7 billion, compared with Wall Street expectations of $5.1 billion.
Qualcomm also disclosed it is under investigation in the European Union over whether it engaged in anticompetitive behavior related to its 5G radio-frequency technologies. The company received a request for information from the European Commission on Dec. 3, the company said in a regulatory filing. Qualcomm said it didn't believe it was violating EU competition rules.
Qualcomm has been caught in a legal tangle for years over allegations that it leveraged its dominance as a supplier of cellphone chips that manage communications with cell towers to extract unfair patent-licensing terms. While the company resolved its licensing dispute with Apple, it is appealing antitrust decisions against it in the U.S., where a court hearing is scheduled this month. It also is appealing an EU fine, issued in 2018, of almost a billion euros.
Shares in the company fell slightly in after-hours trading. The chip maker's stock has gained 79% over the past 12 months through Wednesday's close.

World News: U.S. Prepares Evacuation Amid Chinese Criticism

SHANGHAI -- The U.S. government was preparing to evacuate by air hundreds of Americans from central China on Wednesday in response to the deadly coronavirus outbreak, as Beijing criticized Washington's overall response as unhelpful.
In the second such operation in a week following the December outbreak, two jetliners landed Tuesday in Wuhan to fly roughly 530 people to the U.S. in the evacuation, a person familiar with the planning said.
On the way into China, the two jetliners carried shipments of private aid -- moves that followed several days of criticism from Beijing about U.S. policy following the outbreak of the coronavirus, which has killed hundreds of people and infected more than 20,000, the most in and around Wuhan city.
Days after the first flight on Jan. 28 evacuated more than 200 diplomats, their family members and other U.S. citizens, the U.S. called on all Americans still in mainland China to leave the country. Major U.S. airlines suspended flights -- moves widely echoed around the world as concerns grow about the spread of the highly infectious coronavirus.
China's Foreign Ministry, meantime, has singled out the U.S. government for criticism on a near-daily basis, characterizing its moves as irresponsible and antagonistic.
"The U.S. government hasn't provided any substantial assistance to us, but it was the first to evacuate personnel from its consulate in Wuhan, the first to suggest partial withdrawal of its embassy staff, and the first to impose a travel ban on Chinese travelers," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters on Monday. "All it has done could only create and spread fear, which is a bad example."
Ms. Hua instead lavished praise on a number of countries that she said have sent aid to China: South Korea, Japan, the U.K., France, Turkey, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Hungary, Iran, Belarus and Indonesia.
China's sharp criticism adds to complications in the U.S.-China relationship built up in recent years over technology and trade, among other issues. The dust is just now settling from a two-year trade dispute following a first-stage deal signed in January, though outstanding issues remain in that realm too.
On Jan. 31, the U.S. responded to a World Health Organization designation of China's viral outbreak as a "public-health emergency of international concern" by raising its travel alert for China to the highest level -- "Do Not Travel" -- as well as imposing new checks on arrivals from China, which was followed by the suspension of service to China by major U.S. air carriers.
Those moves were followed by similar travel alerts by other countries and the suspension of flight service to China by roughly 30 global carriers, though some of the first steps to limit entry of visitors from China were taken by North Korea and Singapore -- countries that have long enjoyed close relations with Beijing.
"The U.S. government is coordinating closely with the [People's Republic of China] government to deliver humanitarian assistance and to evacuate additional U.S. citizens from Wuhan," a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy said in response to Ms. Hua's criticism.
Aid to China from the U.S. is coming from private sources, with the help of American authorities. Donations of protective equipment from aviation giant Boeing Co. and two faith-based charities, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Samaritan's Purse, for instance, were being flown into Wuhan on this week's U.S. government-organized flights, according to a person familiar with the U.S. plan.
"We saw the comment from China's Foreign Ministry, and to be honest it did sting," said Ker Gibbs, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.

Dow Jumps 408 on Growth Hopes

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 400 points as volatility regained a foothold and investors bet that global growth will survive the coronavirus outbreak in China.
The march upward marked the fourth time in seven trading sessions that the S&P 500 has moved by more than 1%, a surge in volatility that follows several months of unusual calm. Investors have attributed the big moves to uncertainty about how the outbreak in a vital economic center will ripple through global business as well as to the elevated levels stocks had reached after standout returns in 2019.
"Today is really emblematic of what we've seen, this ebb and flow between headlines and fears," said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide.
The leap of 407.82 points, or 1.4%, brought the blue-chip index to 28807.63, returning it to positive territory for the year after anxiety about the economic implications of the coronavirus led to a selloff Friday. At its peak Tuesday, the Dow was up more than 500 points.
The S&P 500 advanced 48.67 points, or 1.5%, to 3297.59, within 1% of its record close on Jan. 17. The Nasdaq Composite added 194.57 points, or 2.1%, to 9467.97, a record close for the tech-heavy index.
The gains reflect an expectation among investors that government responses will blunt the impact of the virus outbreak. Data in recent days showing that global manufacturing appeared to be steadying, along with the Chinese central bank's moves to inject liquidity into the country's banking system, have allayed some of the most pressing concerns about global growth, investors said.
In the U.S., a widely followed gauge Monday showed that the manufacturing sector in January had returned to growth, and data Tuesday showed that new orders for manufactured goods rose in December at the fastest pace in more than a year.
Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China offered funds in the overnight market for a second consecutive day, as it seeks to encourage lending to businesses that are struggling. The Chinese government has barred travel and asked companies to halt operations as it tries to stop the spread of the deadly virus.
"There has been some investor psychology being built up over the last 10 years that the central banks will do whatever they need to," said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank. "That is what the equity market is at least betting on. Whether that comes through, we'll have to see."
Until last week, the S&P 500 hadn't moved up or down 1% in a single session since October, as it closed out a year in which it climbed 29%. That period of calm was interrupted by fears that the coronavirus outbreak could hinder global economic growth.
"Coming off a year in which the equity markets were as strong as they were, you had to expect that at some point the market was going to need a little bit of a breather," said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. "You can't expect the markets to provide the types of return they did in 2019 indefinitely."
Tuesday's gains were broad, with 10 of the 11 S&P 500 sectors rising. Only the utilities group lost ground.
Amazon.com closed with a $1 trillion market value for the first time, after reaching the mark previously in intraday trading. It joins Apple, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet as the only U.S. firms to reach the threshold.
As earnings season continued, shares of Alphabet fell $37.19, or 2.5%, to $1,445.41 after the company reported disappointing performance in its core advertising business, with fourth-quarter operating income and revenue missing consensus estimates.
Ralph Lauren shares gained $10.42, or 9.2%, to $123.68 after the fashion brand reported better-than-expected revenue and adjusted earnings.
Tesla continued a rally it began last week, soaring $107.06, or 14%, to $887.06. The stock got a boost at the end of January when the company reported making record deliveries in the fourth quarter and said it planned to deliver more cars globally in 2020.
Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1.6%, while the Shanghai Composite Index ended the day up 1.3%, following a selloff Monday.
At midday Wednesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average was up 1.2%. Also early in the Asian trading day, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.6% and the Shanghai Composite was up 1.5%.
As investors left haven assets in search of better returns, yields on government bonds rose. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury climbed to 1.603% from 1.520% Monday.
Oil prices continued to decline, with Brent crude, the global benchmark, losing 0.9% to settle at $53.96 a barrel -- its lowest settlement value since Dec. 31, 2018 -- a day after skidding into a bear market.
The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against 16 others, rose less than 0.1%.

BP Raises Payout, Adds $5 Billion to Divestiture Targets

LONDON -- BP PLC raised its dividend on Tuesday at the same time as reporting a small loss and extending its planned asset sales by an additional $5 billion, joining other oil companies that are shedding assets to help maintain shareholder returns.
Last week, Royal Dutch Shell PLC also beefed up its pipeline of divestitures and slowed spending on its share-buyback program amid weaker earnings.
In the U.S., Exxon Mobil Corp. has a continuing divestiture program targeting the sale of $15 billion of assets by 2021.
The divestitures come as a combination of lower energy prices and weaker refining and chemical margins are hurting the sector's profitability.
BP announced an expanded plan to divest itself of $15 billion of assets by mid-2021, having previously targeted $10 billion in asset sales by the end of 2020. The company already has unloaded $9.4 billion in assets since the start of 2019.
Its U.S. gas assets sold for less than expected, BP said, contributing to impairment charges of $4.5 billion since October, including $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter.
Income from the divestitures helped lower BP's ratio of net debt to the total of net debt and equity to 35% including leases, in the fourth quarter from 36% in the third quarter.
This remains above the company's long-term target of between 20% and 30%.
Lower debt and additional divestitures have given the company confidence to raise the dividend now, said BP's chief financial officer, Brian Gilvary, in an interview.
BP's shares in London rose 4.2% on Tuesday.
Colin Smith, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the increased dividend was eye-catching, "particularly as it comes when gearing is above the top end of the guidance range with the macro outlook rapidly deteriorating."
The fourth quarter also marked the final set of results overseen by BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley.
His successor, Bernard Looney, will take up the role on Wednesday.
He takes control at a difficult time. Adding to the energy sector's challenges, the outbreak of coronavirus is expected to slow economic growth, thereby dragging on global oil-demand growth.
"We recognize the headwinds you can see are really around coronavirus and what that does to the oil price," said Mr. Gilvary.
BP expects the virus could knock oil demand by between 300,000 and 500,000 barrels a day this year from a previous expectation of 1.2 million barrels a day of demand growth.

Yields Gain As Traders Consider Politics

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury posted its largest one-day gain in nearly two months Tuesday, lifted by economic stimulus in China, signs of recovery in manufacturing and the stalled release of results from the Iowa Democratic caucuses.
The 10-year yield, which rises when bond prices fall, climbed to 1.603%, according to Tradeweb, from 1.520% Monday.
The move ended a series of declines for the yield, a key barometer for financial markets which helps set borrowing costs throughout the economy, after worries the coronavirus would spark a slowdown dragged yields lower in recent sessions.
Traders named several factors pushing yields higher. Fresh data in recent days has shown global manufacturing steadying, and the Chinese central bank has moved to inject liquidity into its banking system this week, allaying some of the most pressing concerns about global growth, investors said.
Even the delayed release of results from the Democratic caucuses in Iowa helped boost yields, because it diminishes the odds of President Donald Trump losing the election and suggests current policy could continue, several investors said.
Investors have closely watched the Iowa results because policy differences between the candidates could spark swings in everything from stocks to shares of oil companies ahead of a general election now just nine months away.
In a survey of 645 investors conducted by Morgan Stanley -- with results published in November -- 9 out of 10 said they expect the U.S. elections to have a significant impact on their market outlook.
"If the elections shape up to be a closely contested affair, investors with deeply held convictions should pay close attention to surprising shifts in sentiment, especially if they run counter to the prevailing consensus at the time," said Morgan Stanley research analysts in a client note.
Investors had spent much of recent sessions worrying about the potential drag the coronavirus could have on global growth, with airlines halting flights and companies such as Apple Inc. temporarily closing stores and offices in China.
The gambling center of Macau, which pulled in more than five times the revenue of Las Vegas in 2018, said Tuesday it planned to shut its casinos for 15 days.
Analysts and traders said even with stocks rebounding Tuesday, much of the selling in safer assets such as government debt has come during periods of reduced trading, and researchers at banks are advising clients to hold on to instruments allowing them to hedge against future uncertainty over the severity and duration of the epidemic.

'One China' dispute creates woes for Taiwan amid crisis

Conflict about island's status left Taipei in the dark about outbreak
HONG KONG " For nearly two weeks, Taiwanese officials appealed to their counterparts in Beijing to let them evacuate their people from the Chinese city at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. They say they were met with silence. 
'We were probably among the first to send that request that we wanted to take our people back and lift them out of Wuhan,' said Chen Ming-chi, a deputy minister at Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council. 'It sort of got ignored.'
Taiwanese officials sent more formal requests through various organizations, and still, nothing. 
Then on Sunday, Chen finally heard " through Chinese state media " that a first batch of Taiwanese, about 200 of the 500 stranded in Wuhan, would return via a Chinese charter plane. He said his office was not informed about the development and was given scant details about who would be on board.
'China still focuses on unilateralism when dealing with Taiwan's affairs, but this time, we aren't complaining. This is an issue of urgency,' Chen said.
When Wuhan went into lockdown on Jan. 23 to control the spread of the coronavirus, thousands of foreigners were stranded. They included business people on short visits, students from elsewhere in Asia on scholarships at Wuhan University, American English-language teachers, and migrant workers in glass, auto and steel factories. 
Their fate " how quickly they have been able to return home, how susceptible they have become to the virus and how their mental health has fared " has depended a great deal on their respective governments' political relationships with China. With the outbreak sickening more than 20,000 people and killing more than 420, critics have accused China of playing politics with people's lives and of using its economic sway to save face and bolster its standing.
The predicament is most apparent in the case of Taiwan, which has an especially tense relationship with Beijing over disputed interpretations of the island's status. The Chinese Communist Party considers the self-ruled democracy to be part of 'one China' under Beijing's authority.
But Taiwan says it is not and never has been part of the People's Republic. Its government has fought back against Taiwan's exclusion from international organizations, in particular the World Health Organization.
Taiwanese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou, speaking in Taipei on Tuesday, said Taiwan has received very limited information from the WHO, and she appealed to the body to include Taiwan's officials in meetings. China, however, says it sufficiently represents Taiwan at the WHO. 
'Internationally, the Chinese government, rudely and unreasonably, has been pressuring Taiwan and putting political considerations above human health,' Ou said. 'This, basically, is extremely vile.' 
China and the WHO say that Taiwan is getting the information it needs. Beijing has accused President Tsai Ing-wen, who won reelection last month, and her ruling Democratic Progessive Party of playing politics. 
J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior fellow with the Global Taiwan Institute in Washington, said Beijing's approach has been a hallmark of the way the Chinese Communist Party behaves. 
'It never misses an opportunity to assail the Tsai administration and to split Taiwanese society,' he said. 'Such crass behavior in a time of crisis can easily backfire and further alienate the Taiwanese public.'
Other regional leaders with strong ties to China could pay politically for perceptions that they have protected Beijing's sensitivities rather than their citizens. Before Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte expanded a travel ban on people from Hubei province to include all of mainland China on Sunday, critics accused him of backing his allies in Beijing over the safety of Filipinos. 
Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has been criticized for his decision not to evacuate about 500 Pakistani students and their families from Wuhan. The students have taken to social media and written to their officials, pleading for help and begging to go home. India and Bangladesh, meanwhile, have airlifted their citizens out of China. 
Pakistan resumed flights to and from China on Monday, bucking a global trend of tightening travel restrictions. Explaining the decision to leave their citizens in Hubei province, Pakistani officials said China has better medical facilities to treat the outbreak. 
At least four Pakistanis in Wuhan have tested positive for coronavirus. 
'The Pakistani people are standing firmly with their Chinese brethren,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday, while condemning the United States for not providing 'substantive help' to the Chinese side and for being among the first to withdraw consulate staff members from Wuhan. 
And then there is Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who has not only refused to evacuate his citizens from Wuhan but has pledged to visit the virus-stricken city if Chinese officials allow it. The 67-year-old is Asia's longest-ruling leader, and with China's backing, he has undermined democracy and cemented one-party rule in his country. 
'Why would Hun Sen not dare to go to Wuhan to visit Cambodian students,' he said at a summit in Seoul, referring to himself in the third person. He has declined to impose travel restrictions on visitors and flights from mainland China, saying it would 'destroy ties with China.' 
Hun Sen's stance has left Phon Malis, a 20-year-old pharmacy student at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, feeling scared and isolated. One of about two dozen Cambodian students in Wuhan, she arrived in August, hopeful that the opportunity would chart a new future for her once she returned home.
Instead, a nightmarish situation began for her and other Cambodians when the city was locked down, leaving them with scarcely any food and confined to a tiny dormitory. It especially hurt, she said, to see friends from Thailand and Myanmar leave on chartered planes aided by their governments.
'When I heard our prime minister say such things, I feel so small and insignificant, like we don't have any value,' Phon Malis said. 'I just want to reunite with my family, and go home.'

Dow climbs 407 points as earnings, manufacturing data offset virus fears

Ex-Fed chair Yellen predicts 'spillover' from hit to China's economy
Global markets were in recovery mode Tuesday after last week's coronavirus-fueled sell-off, with the Dow Jones industrial average climbing 407 points.
The virus responsible for at least 427 deaths and more than 20,400 infections has weighed heavily on investors, who fear it will have a chilling effect on the global economy and throw a wrench into the supply chains of some of the world's most powerful companies. But manufacturing data in recent days " showing the United States had emerged from a five-month contraction in January and that global output had been recovering from an extended, pre-virus slowdown " assuaged some concerns.
'Manufacturing was one of the tea leaves arguing the U.S. economy was sliding toward recession, and now that company executives are more bullish about the 2020 outlook, the word recession needs to be banished by stock market investors permanently,' Chris Rupkey, the chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, wrote in a note to investors Monday.
By the close of markets Tuesday, the Dow was trading up 1.4-percent. The Standard - Poor's 500-stock index had gained 1.5-percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq had risen 2.1-percent. The Shanghai Composite index, which shed 8-percent Monday in its first day of trading since the Lunar New Year, rebounded to close with a 1.3-percent gain after the People's Bank of China injected liquidity to support the market for the second day in a row. China-exposed companies whose stocks took a beating last week saw their shares rise, with Apple climbing 3.3-percent, Delta Air Lines up 3-percent and American Airlines up 5-percent.
Oil prices, which sank to a one-year low beneath $50 a barrel on Monday, were mixed Tuesday. Brent crude closed at $53.87 and West Texas Intermediate closed at $49.46. The virus has all but halted travel in China, the world's leading oil consumer, and prompted air carriers and tourism companies to announce widespread cancellations. Gold, a haven for investors in turbulent times, was down 1.6-percent.
Strong fourth-quarter earnings from giants such as Amazon, Apple, Tesla and Coca-Cola have also sparked positive sentiment in recent days. But Google parent Alphabet saw its shares plummet after the company reported income and revenue misses thanks to weak performance in its advertising business. Ford reported it lost $1.6-billion in the fourth quarter, and shares plunged in after-hours trading.
Despite the turnaround, storm clouds lie ahead. Experts have been using the 2003 SARS outbreak to gauge the potential fallout from the coronavirus on global growth, and a 2004 study from the Brookings Institution, Korea University and the Australian National University estimated that the outbreak delivered a $40-billion hit to the global economy; that would amount to about $56-billion today, adjusting for inflation. But the stakes are far higher now, as China is now one of the world's most vital economic engines: Its gross domestic product is roughly $13-trillion, compared with $1.6-trillion during the SARS outbreak. Even if the virus is contained quickly, economists are predicting China's growth rate will fall to between 3 and 4 percent this quarter.
'While I fully acknowledge the strong earnings and data from the United States, indeed pre Wuhan crisis, I fully expected the U.S. to continue to outperform the rest of the developed world,' Jeffrey Halley, an analyst with OANDA, wrote in commentary Tuesday. 'Those earnings and data points though are backwards facing, and the potential impact of the Wuhan virus is nowhere near yet being able to be fully quantified in its implications for global growth.'
At a Bipartisan Policy Center event Tuesday, former Federal Reserve chair Janet L. Yellen said that though past epidemics such as SARS delivered a short-term economic blow that then faded, it is unclear whether that will be the case with the coronavirus.
'China is such a significant piece of the global economy that it's bound to have spillover effects,' she said.
The outbreak comes at a pivotal moment, when the global economy was expected to rebound thanks to the trade truce between the United States and China. The outbreak has forced Starbucks to close half its stores in China, while McDonald's, KFC, Ikea and Apple have also announced closures. Delta, United Airlines and American Airlines joined a large group of European air carriers in suspending service to China, and casinos in Macao " the world's largest gambling market " are closing their doors for two weeks. 
Hyundai on Tuesday became the first global automaker to suspend operations because of the virus. The South Korean auto giant said it would be forced to stop factory production in the country because China's shuttered factories spawned a components shortage. Its shares closed down more than 7.2-percent.

Okay, fans. It's time for a quiz. 
Can you tell me two things that Super Bowl LIV, Punxsutawney Phil CXXXIV and Stock Market CCXXX have in common? 
Give up?
Okay. The first thing is that even though these Roman numerals are sort of pretentious, using them is a lot of fun. 
And the second is that the Super Bowl, Punxsutawney's favorite rodent and the stock market all get enveloped by widely disseminated predictions that are not terribly reliable. 
Super Bowl first.
In the two weeks between the end of the conference championship games and Super Sunday, we get bombarded by predictions and opinions about what is going to happen and why.
But after the game is over, how often do you see people whose predictions were proved wrong own up to the errors and try to figure out where they went awry? 
Judging from the Super Bowl media that I've consumed over the decades, the answer is, 'not very much.' 
On the groundhog front, it turns out that Punxsutawney Phil, who made his 134th prediction on Sunday, has a pretty dreadful record of predicting when winter will end. 
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Phil's been right on only four of his last 10 predictions.
This .400 record would be a great batting average for a baseball player, but it's a pretty wretched record for a supposed oracle.
The StormFax Almanac rates Phil's long-term record even lower: at 39 percent from Phil's first appearance, in 1887, through 2019.
The fact that the Phil's predictions are totally useless doesn't stop people from gathering on Gobbler's Knob. The point of going, of course, isn't the predictions " it's the spectacle. 
Which brings us to the U.S. stock market, whose origin I'm dating to 1790, the year the Philadelphia Stock Exchange opened. Hence my Roman numerals totaling 230. (The newbie New York Stock Exchange didn't open until 1792.)
If you read or watch coverage of the financial markets, you'll notice that every day that the stock markets are open, stories purport to explain what happened and why.
Then the next day, should the market head in the other direction " which happens a lot "new stories purport to explain why that happened. You almost never see stories that pose the question of whether previous stories were based on flawed information.
Back when I was a young business writer " I've been at this for more than 50 years " I used to ask my bosses why we ran daily stock market stories even when there were not sizable moves that were attributable, at least in part, to dramatic, unexpected events.
The answer, of course, was that people really wanted to read about the market's daily moves, so we would write about them. 
This past week was a classic example of why trying to figure out what markets are going to do on a day-by-day basis is so maddening. And why I sympathize with my journalistic colleagues who find themselves producing daily markets coverage. 
Consider the numbers posted by an underappreciated market indicator, the Wilshire 5000 total U.S. stock market index. (I like using the W5K because unlike the Dow industrials or even the S-P 500, it can't be skewed by the performance of one or two stocks.)
Stocks fell $525 billion (1.52-percent) on Monday; rose $350 billion (0.99 percent) on Tuesday; lost $25 billion on Wednesday; rose $100 billion on Thursday; and then fell a whopping $600 billion (1.74-percent) on Friday. 
In other words, every down day was followed by an up day, and vice versa.
If I'd had to try to explain the daily movements and why they were the reverse of the previous day, I would have had to tear out some of my few remaining hairs.
Friday's fall was attributed to the spreading of the coronavirus, which is having an impact on China, the world's second-largest economy, and seems to be spreading beyond China's borders.
As I write this, the news is that the coronavirus is going to seriously damage China's economy and is going to be a big problem for the world economy. Which, by implication, would mean a big problem for the world's stock markets, as well. 
I don't pretend to be a stock market genius " if I were, I would be a multibillionaire rather than a business columnist.
But I'll bet you that by the time this is finished, the coronavirus " serious as it is, especially if you or your loved ones are exposed to it in any way " will be a lot less serious than doomsayers are predicting.
We have been in a bull market, with few interruptions, for almost 11 years " U.S. stocks bottomed on March 9, 2009 " so it's not surprising to see stocks sink because of coronavirus fears. 
But nothing goes on forever, despite what you may read or hear today or tomorrow or sometime during this week. 
So let me repeat what I consider an eternal verity for those of us (including me) who are amateur investors. 
Don't let daily news stampede you into selling or buying. Don't try to out-trade the market. 
Make sure that you have a strong enough stomach and a strong enough personal balance sheet to stay the course. 
And, above all, don't put away your winter clothing early because of Punxsutawney Phil's latest prediction. Judging from history, there's an LXI percent chance that he's wrong.

Like many Chinese immigrants, my parents operated restaurants for most of their lives. But instead of dishing up chow mein and egg rolls at their Houston businesses, they served hamburgers and chicken-fried steak.
One day, my mom asked one of the waitresses whether her parents would like to come for dinner. 'Oh, no, ma'am,' she replied. 'I asked, but my father said he wouldn't eat at any place run by Chinese. You can't trust what they will try to pass for meat.'
That sad stereotype continues today, amplified by concerns over the origins of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China. Rumors and reports that the virus may have been contracted by people eating exotic foods in China have revived suspicions here in the United States of Chinese immigrants and Chinese Americans alike.
Some Chinese do eat things considered exotic. Media in the United States and elsewhere have regaled in reporting that a seafood market in Wuhan sold items such as rats and wolf pups. An Internet rumor took life in the British media that the virus was connected to the consumption of bats. This was egged on by a video showing a Chinese vlogger eating a bat. That video was made in 2016, and it wasn't recorded in China.
But the consumption of exotic meats is not exclusive to China, and the definition of exotic is subjective. In the Mid-Atlantic United States, there is a dish called scrapple, which is a meatloaf made with the scraps of slaughtered pig. A common description of the ingredients is, 'Everything but the squeal.' I've tried it, and I can say it is not something high on my list of things to try again. I've also eaten fried alligator, grilled octopus and roasted rattlesnake, none of which would be found in a Chinese restaurant or home.
Although dog, cat and rat can be found on plates in China and elsewhere, they aren't served at restaurants in the United States. Still, rumors of Chinese restaurants serving meat from those animals persist.
The suspicions are rooted in age-old tropes about Chinese food, and they are still used against Chinese immigrants and Chinese Americans, especially during crises such as the coronavirus outbreak. Since the first Chinese immigrated to the United States in the early 1800s, we have been viewed with distrust and racism. American media played a role in this, reporting on opium dens and asking if Chinese eat rats. Such sentiments culminated in the federal Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.
Much of the misunderstanding of Chinese food comes from that era. The Chinese custom of cutting meat and vegetables into bite-size pieces made it hard to discern ingredients. And the people cooking these dishes were low-skilled, low-paid laborers, who were mostly men, trying desperately to use what little they knew of cooking to replicate dishes from home while making do with whatever foodstuffs were at hand. This resulted in dishes such as chop suey, which is as close to authentic Chinese cuisine as SpaghettiOs are to Italian.
Just as American views toward Chinese have progressed, so has Chinese cuisine. Still, there is a separation between dishes most Americans are familiar with and those served in China or Chinese households in America.
When people ask me to recommend a Chinese restaurant, I ask them, 'What's your favorite dish?' If they respond sweet-and-sour something or beef and broccoli, then I know which direction to send them. But if they say steamed fish or something involving a black bean sauce, I know they have some experience with non-Americanized Chinese cuisine.
Still, there has been a slow acceptance of the broader menu, from dim sum to roasted pork belly. Higher-end Chinese restaurants in the United States will often offer items such as sea cucumber, geoduck clam and cuttlefish. All of those sound exotic, but the irony is that geoduck clams aren't native to China; they are found in western Canada and the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Chinese chefs adopted them. 
Some of that hesitancy to explore beyond the sweet-and-sour list is rooted in the same suspicions that have existed for more than a century.
When I asked my mom why we didn't serve Chinese food at our restaurant, she said that it took too much work to prepare and she didn't want to have to make the kind of food that Americans would eat.
We used to have a big annual Lunar New Year dinner at their last restaurant, which did have some Chinese items. At the dinner, my mom would pull out all the stops, serving up dishes that only top-line restaurants did.
One year, she made bird's nest soup. When a customer asked me why it was called this, I explained that the name comes from the fact that a key ingredient was derived from swiftlet nests, which were boiled down to extract the bird saliva that hold the nests together. That ingredient sells for about $110 an ounce. At one time, that soup was reserved for the imperial court.
After I revealed that ingredient, most of the customers didn't eat the soup. My mother was so upset. That soup represented all the profits from that dinner. She didn't care about the money, though. She just wanted the customers to try something other than sweet-and-sour.

U.S. Treasury Yields Climb as Investors Eye Iowa Caucuses; Policy differences between candidates could spark swings in markets ahead of general election

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury posted its largest one-day gain in nearly two months Tuesday, lifted by economic stimulus in China, signs of recovery in manufacturing and the stalled release of results from the Iowa Democratic caucuses.
The 10-year yield, which rises when bond prices fall, climbed to 1.603%, according to Tradeweb, from 1.520% Monday.
The move ended a series of declines for the yield, a key barometer for financial markets which helps set borrowing costs throughout the economy, after worries the coronavirus would spark a slowdown dragged yields lower in recent sessions.
Traders named several factors pushing yields higher. Fresh data in recent days has shown global manufacturing steadying, and the Chinese central bank has moved to inject liquidity into its banking system this week, allaying some of the most pressing concerns about global growth, investors said. Even the delayed release of results from the Democratic caucuses in Iowa helped boost yields, because it diminishes the odds of President Donald Trump losing the election and suggests current policy could continue, several investors said.
Investors are closely watching the Iowa results, because policy differences between the candidates could spark swings in everything from stocks to shares of oil companies ahead of a general election now just nine months away.
In a survey of 645 investors conducted by Morgan Stanley—with results published in November—9 out of 10 said they expect the U.S. elections to have a significant impact on their market outlook.
"If the elections shape up to be a closely contested affair, investors with deeply held convictions should pay close attention to surprising shifts in sentiment, especially if they run counter to the prevailing consensus at the time," said Morgan Stanley research analysts in a client note.
Investors had spent much of recent sessions worrying about the potential drag the coronavirus could have on global growth, with airlines halting flights and companies such as Apple Inc. temporarily closing stores and offices in China. The gambling center of Macau, which pulled in more than five times the revenue of Las Vegas in 2018, said Tuesday it planned to shut its casinos for 15 days.
Analysts and traders said even with stocks rebounding Tuesday, much of the selling in safer assets such as government debt has come during periods of reduced trading, and researchers at banks are advising clients to hold on to instruments allowing them to hedge against future uncertainty over the severity and duration of the epidemic.
"Global stocks are groping for the 'worst is past' signal, but today seems too soon to make that call, based on the virus's growth path this week," said Jim Vogel, head of government debt strategy at FHN Financial, in a note to clients.

Dow Rises More than 400 Points as Higher Volatility Makes Comeback; U.S. benchmarks add 1.4% or more as investors bet on economic resilience; Nasdaq closes at record

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 400 points Tuesday as volatility regained a foothold in the market and investors bet that global growth will survive the coronavirus outbreak in China.
Tuesday's upward march for U.S. stocks marked the fourth time in seven trading sessions that the S&P 500 has moved by more than 1%, a surge in volatility that follows several months of unusual calm. Investors have attributed the big moves to uncertainty about how the outbreak in a vital economic center will ripple through global business, as well as to the elevated levels stocks had reached after standout returns in 2019.
"Today is really emblematic of what we've seen, this ebb and flow between headlines and fears," said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide.
The leap of 407.82 points, or 1.4%, brought the blue-chip index to 28807.63, returning it to positive territory for the year after anxiety about the economic implications of the coronavirus led to a sharp selloff Friday. At its peak Tuesday, the Dow was up more than 500 points.
The S&P 500 advanced 48.67 points, or 1.5%, to 3297.59, within 1% of its record close on Jan. 17. The Nasdaq Composite added 194.57 points, or 2.1%, to 9467.97, a record close for the tech-heavy index.
The gains reflect an expectation among investors that government responses will blunt the impact of the virus outbreak. Fresh data in recent days showing that global manufacturing appeared to be steadying, along with the Chinese central bank's moves to inject liquidity into the country's banking system, have allayed some of the most pressing concerns about global growth, investors said.
In the U.S., a widely followed gauge Monday showed that the manufacturing sector in January had returned to growth, and data Tuesday showed that new orders for manufactured goods rose in December at the fastest pace in more than a year.
Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China offered funds in the overnight market for a second consecutive day, as it seeks to encourage lending to businesses that are struggling. The Chinese government has barred travel and asked companies to halt operations as it tries to stop the spread of the deadly virus that has killed more than 400 people and infected more than 20,000.
"There has been some investor psychology being built up over the last 10 years that the central banks will do whatever they need to," said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank. "That is what the equity market is at least betting on. Whether that comes through, we'll have to see."
Until last week, the S&P 500 hadn't moved up or down 1% in a single session since October, as it closed out a year in which it climbed 29%. That period of calm was interrupted by fears that the coronavirus outbreak in China could hinder global economic growth.
"Coming off a year in which the equity markets were as strong as they were, you had to expect that at some point the market was going to need a little bit of a breather," said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. "You can't expect the markets to provide the types of return they did in 2019 indefinitely."
Tuesday's gains were broad, with 10 of the 11 S&P 500 sectors rising. Only the utilities group lost ground.
Amazon.com closed with a $1 trillion market value for the first time, after reaching the mark previously in intraday trading. The e-commerce giant joins Apple, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet as the only U.S. firms to reach the threshold.
As earnings season continued, investors scrutinized corporate reports. Shares of Alphabet fell $37.19, or 2.5%, to $1445.41 after it reported disappointing performance in its core advertising business, with fourth-quarter operating income and revenue missing consensus estimates.
Ralph Lauren shares gained $10.42, or 9.2%, to $123.68 after the fashion brand reported better-than-expected revenue and adjusted earnings in the latest quarter.
And Tesla continued a rally it began last week, soaring $107.06, or 14%, to $887.06. The stock got a boost at the end of January when the company reported making record deliveries in the fourth quarter and said it planned to deliver more cars globally in 2020.
Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1.6%, while the Shanghai Composite Index ended the day up 1.3%, following a steep selloff Monday.

What do you think could derail the advance in global stock markets this week? Join the conversation below.
As investors left haven assets in search of better returns, yields on government bonds rose. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury climbed to 1.603%, from 1.520% Monday.
Crude prices continued their decline, with Brent crude, the global benchmark, losing 0.9% to settle at $53.96 a barrel—its lowest settle value since Dec. 31, 2018—a day after skidding into a bear market . The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are weighing a more aggressive response, including deeper production cuts, in response to the deepening impact of China's new coronavirus, The Wall Street Journal reported.

U.S. News: World's Factories Return To Growth but Face Risk

Global manufacturing appeared to be steadying after a long slowdown, but is set to suffer a fresh setback due to China's isolation in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index rose to 50.9 in January from 47.2 in December, indicating a return to growth for the first time since July as new orders and production picked up. A reading above 50 indicates activity is expanding across the manufacturing sector, while below 50 signals contraction.
The increase "echoes the message from the other surveys that the prospects for factory sector activity are starting to improve, while adding to the broader evidence that the economy is turning a corner," said Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
Tim Fiore, who oversees the ISM survey of factory purchasing and supply managers, welcomed January's reading. But he questioned whether the expansion would be sustained in the coming months given weakness in some January inputs, including supplier deliveries, inventories and imports.
A small number of businesses in the survey commented on the coronavirus, Mr. Fiore said, although by the time the survey collected its data the scale of the outbreak was only just beginning to unfold.
"I'm sure it's going to have a pretty strong impact in February," he said.
Meantime a final IHS Markit manufacturing survey for the U.S. released Monday dipped to a three-month low as exports fell, although it also remained in expansionary territory last month at 51.9, down from 52.4 in December.
January surveys of factories in Asia and Europe showed a slower decline in output, with shrinking inventories and stabilizing new orders pointing to a rebound in activity over coming months.
But those surveys were largely completed before uncertainty over the virus disrupted world-wide trade and supply chains. China is the world's largest manufacturing economy, and factories around the globe rely on its products to make their own, and produce goods that are used in Chinese production.
"The interruption of supply chains could have a snowball effect if stocks of essential electronic components from China are depleted," said Timme Spakman, a trade economist at ING Bank.
Before the virus began to spread, economists had expected global manufacturing to steady and then pick up in the early months of 2020, boosted in part by a trade truce between the U.S. and China. That expectation underpinned hopes that global economic growth would accelerate this year, having slowed to its weakest pace since the financial crisis in 2019.
Surveys of purchasing managers at European factories continued to point to weakness in output. But they also showed a more modest drop in new orders in January, while businesses had run down their stocks of finished products. According to the compiler of the surveys -- data firm IHS Markit -- that combination pointed to a pickup in the sector over the coming months.

Yields Stabilize As China Stimulates

A weekslong rally in U.S. government bonds paused after China's central bank took stimulus measures to mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus and data showed a rebound in U.S. manufacturing activity.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 1.520%, according to Tradeweb, compared with 1.521% Friday.
Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, initially climbed after China's central bank said Sunday it would inject 1.2 trillion yuan ($173 billion) into the financial system in response to the continued spread of the coronavirus, which has threatened to disrupt the global economy.
Yields got another boost after the Institute for Supply Management said its U.S. manufacturing index rose to 50.9 in January from 47.2 in December, indicating the first monthly expansion in the sector since July. Demand for bonds, though, quickly picked up again, reflecting the continued appeal of safer assets amid ongoing concerns about the coronavirus.
Investors this year had been hopeful that the global economy could rebound from 2019 -- when it grew at its slowest pace since the financial crisis -- thanks in part to a de-escalation of the U.S.-China tariff battle and promises of support from Federal Reserve officials.
The coronavirus has damped that optimism as governments around the world have sought to block visitors from China, suggesting the virus is already becoming a drag on economic activity even as public-health experts continue to study how contagious it is.
Underscoring the concerns about the economic outlook, the yield on the 10-year note closed below the yield of the three-month Treasury bill on Monday for the third consecutive session.
Investors closely watch the dispersion of Treasury yields because recessions have often followed times when long-term yields have dropped below short-term yields, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve. An inversion of the 10-year and three-month yields is seen as a particularly reliable signal of a coming economic contraction.
The dollar strengthened, with the WSJ Dollar Index -- which measures the currency against 16 others -- up 0.42% to 90.93. The increase was the index's largest point and percentage gain since late September and snaps a two-session losing streak.
The dollar fell 0.3% against the euro but gained against the British pound and the Japanese yen.

Stocks Rebound as Oil Prices Fall

Stocks rebounded after last week's decline, though oil prices continued to slide on concerns that China's coronavirus outbreak will reduce energy consumption.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 143.78 points, or 0.5%, to 28399.81. The S&P 500 gained 23.40, or 0.7%, to 3248.92. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 122.47, or 1.3%, to 9273.40.
The S&P 500 is back in positive territory for the year. A big drop Friday -- the worst day for the broad-based index since August -- had briefly wiped out its year-to-date gains for 2020.
Oil prices fell on worries that the virus will continue to disrupt the world's second-largest economy. U.S. crude oil futures fell $1.45, or 2.8%, to settle at $50.11 a barrel. They are down more than 20% from a recent peak in early January.
Futures on Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell $2.17, or 3.8% to $54.45 a barrel, their lowest settlement in more than a year and more than 20% below where they were in September.
Saudi Arabia is pushing for significant oil-production cuts to prop up prices, according to OPEC officials. Representatives of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are set to meet Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss next steps.
U.S. stock investors may have seen Friday's selloff as a buying opportunity, said Michael Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners.
He noted that with past outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, stocks have tended to drop initially, only to bounce back once the rate of new infections slows.
"Once you see a slowdown in the uptick of new cases, historically the market has generally done quite well after that," Mr. Mullaney said.
Chinese authorities have quarantined millions of people to contain the virus. Major global airlines have suspended flights to mainland China.
Chinese markets tumbled sharply Monday, the first day of trading following the extended Lunar New Year break. The Shanghai Composite Index closed 7.7% lower in its steepest drop since August 2015, with many stocks dropping by the maximum 10% that is allowed.
The move had been expected because Chinese markets closed just as the outbreak was beginning to draw widespread attention.
In addition, investors were also watching Monday's presidential caucuses in Iowa for insights into whether a candidate who supports a bigger role for government may beat out rival Democratic contenders. The state is expected to play a role in winnowing down the field of Democratic candidates as the party chooses who will take on President Trump in November.
"Markets have previously reacted quite strongly when left-wing, populist Democratic candidates have performed well," said Oliver Jones, market economist at Capital Economics.
In an upbeat sign for the U.S. economy, the U.S. factory sector improved in January, moving into expansionary territory for the first time since July.
The Institute for Supply Management said that its manufacturing index rose to 50.9 in January from 47.2 in December.
Readings above 50 indicate activity is expanding across the manufacturing sector, while those below 50 signal contraction.
Manufacturing has been a weak spot for the economy, which has continued growing over the past year largely on the strength of consumer spending.
In corporate news, Tesla shares jumped $129.43, or 20%, to a record close of $780 after analysts at Argus Research and ARK Invest raised their price targets for the electric-car maker.
Gilead Sciences climbed $3.16, or 5%, to $66.36. The drugmaker on Friday said it had provided doses of an experimental antiviral drug to doctors for the emergency treatment of a small number of patients infected by the coronavirus.
Exxon Mobil shares slid $1.39, or 2.2%, to $60.73 after analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their rating to sell from neutral. Slumping oil prices also weighed on Exxon, making it the second-worst performer in the Dow.
The British pound fell 1.6% against the dollar, reflecting concerns about trade talks between the European Union and the U.K., said Jordan Rochester, a foreign-exchange strategist at Nomura Holdings.
The U.K. formally exited from the EU Friday and entered into a transition period. Both sides fired opening salvos on Monday as they begin the negotiations that will determine the terms of their future relationship.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.2%.
"We expect a tough talk in the opening rounds of the Brexit talks," Mr. Rochester said.

Oil prices slid into bear-market territory on Monday, highlighting investors' growing concern that China's deadly coronavirus will hurt the global economy by reducing demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel in an already well-supplied market.
The declines capped an eventful day in markets. President Xi Jinping of China delivered a speech Monday describing the outbreak as a major test of the country's system of governance and vowing consequences for officials who shirk responsibility in tackling the crisis. U.S. health authorities, meanwhile, reported a second case of the coronavirus being passed from one person to another in the country as they raised the number of the nation's confirmed cases to 11.
The prospect of canceled flights, closed international borders, locked-down cities and idled factories in China, which is the world's biggest oil importer, have rattled financial markets in recent sessions, sparking swings in stocks, bonds and commodities around the world. Many investors remain braced for greater volatility ahead.
The magnitude of the concern is such that Saudi Arabia's push for further production cuts among members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to buoy oil prices on Monday.
Though prices briefly ticked higher after The Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia was advocating a short-term curtailment to combat declining demand related to the outbreak of the virus, they quickly resumed their fall.
Global and U.S. prices finished Monday in bear-market territory, generally defined as a 20% decline from a recent peak. The fall marked a rapid reversal from three weeks ago, when escalating tensions in the Middle East drove international prices above $70 a barrel.
Brent crude, the main international price, closed 3.8% lower at $54.45 a barrel after being down more than 6% earlier in the day. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. price gauge, briefly traded below $50 a barrel for the first time in more than a year and settled down 2.8% at $50.11. U.S. oil prices have shed nearly $11 a barrel to start 2020.
While the decline could give a boost to U.S. motorists, the health crisis is weighing on both stocks and bonds issued by domestic energy companies and straining faraway oil-exporting nations, as reduced refining demand hits the prices they can charge for crude, as well as their revenue.
Representatives of OPEC and its allies are set to meet Tuesday and Wednesday to debate possible action following the outbreak that originated in China. The group could then make a decision to reduce output at a possible meeting next week.
Under one scenario, Saudi Arabia would lead a collective reduction of 500,000 barrels a day that would stand until the crisis is over, the OPEC officials said.
That would add to curbs of the same amounts agreed to in December and bring the restrictions to 2.2 million barrels a day.
Another option under consideration would involve a temporary cut of 1 million barrels a day by the Saudis, aimed at creating a shock in oil markets, the officials said. The kingdom currently produces around 9.7 million barrels a day.
A cut of "500,000 barrels is far from enough but it's typically good for OPEC to be involved with tactical cuts," said Bjarne Schieldrop, an analyst at Sweden's SEB Markets.
"The first numbers out of China show losses to demand of three million barrels a day, and the extent of the virus is still unfolding. We're nowhere near stabilization."
Vienna-based energy consulting firm JBC cut its forecasts Monday for China's oil consumption by one million barrels a day in February and March, amid signs refiners in the country have reduced their oil intake.
Prospects of weakening demand contributed to a 15% decline in oil prices in January.
Saudi officials fear that mounting oil revenue losses threaten their efforts to diversify their economy. The kingdom -- whose largest oil buyer is China -- relies on high oil prices to fund new projects in tourism, real estate or petrochemicals.
While Saudi Arabia's expenditure fell this year by 2.6% to 1.02 trillion riyals ($272 billion), oil prices significantly above $60 a barrel are needed for a balanced budget.
In January, the International Monetary Fund downgraded Saudi Arabia's economic growth forecast for 2020 by 0.3 percentage points to 1.9%, amid concerns that OPEC's previously agreed-upon production cuts would have little impact on oil prices.
December's initial public offering of state-run Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, was seen by Saudis as the most prominent symbol of attempts to diversify the national economy. Since Jan. 9, however, Aramco's shares have lost 3%.
Iran, which had initially objected to an emergency meeting, is open to a mid-February summit, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said Monday, according to Iran's state-controlled news agency, IRNA.

Hong Kong resists closing China border, escalating strike

HONG KONG " Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Monday further restricted the territory's border crossings with mainland China to curb the coronavirus outbreak but stopped short of a blanket closure demanded by hospital workers, who will now escalate a five-day strike.
The strike " organized by a pro-democracy union formed after months of political unrest " represents a conundrum for Lam. Beijing's handpicked leader must weigh the intensifying public health crisis and widespread disaffection toward her government against her obligations to, and instructions from, the Chinese Communist Party. 
On Tuesday, Hong Kong reported its first death from the coronavirus outbreak. The 39-year-old man had been in stable condition late last week, according to the Center for Health Protection, but deteriorated quickly in recent days. He had traveled to Wuhan on Jan. 21, returned to Hong Kong two days later and was admitted to the hospital last Friday. 
Hong Kong, which has its own immigration system but is under China's sovereignty, has reported 15 cases of the novel coronavirus infection. More than 20,000 cases and 400 deaths have been confirmed in mainland China, prompting many nations " including the United States, Singapore and Italy " to impose broad and unprecedented travel restrictions on Chinese nationals and foreign travelers who have passed through the country. 
China's neighbors, such as North Korea and Mongolia, have sealed their borders in an effort to halt the spread of the virus, which has reached more than 20 countries
Lam said Monday that she would leave open only three of the financial center's 14 crossing points with mainland China, including the airport. Hong Kong had already closed six border checkpoints, but Lam said further steps are needed 'because of the latest developments in the outbreak.' She said she hoped the closure would make it inconvenient for people to travel to mainland China and provide a disincentive for people to cross.
But a full border closure was untenable, she said, because of the 'almost unique' situation between Hong Kong and mainland China, including a 'very close relationship' between the people on both sides.
There is 'very legitimate and genuine cross-border traffic that we have to handle, otherwise we will end up with more troubles for this city and the 7 million people in Hong Kong,' she said, citing cases of people who live in Hong Kong but work in the mainland, and vice versa.
She added that her government is 'not the enemies of the Hong Kong people' and is working in their best interest. Calls to shut the border have come from across the political spectrum.
Her moves, however, were insufficient to appease thousands of medical workers, who on Monday began the first wave of a gradual strike designed to pressure the Hong Kong government to fully close the border.
The striking doctors, nurses and others are from the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance, a union formed following anti-government protests that rocked Hong Kong last year over fears that the city has been losing autonomy and ceding control of its affairs to Beijing.
The union on Monday said it will escalate the strike to involve more of its 18,000 members " including front-line medical workers " citing the government's unwillingness to cede to their demands and a breakdown in talks with the Hospital Authority, which manages the territory's government hospitals.
'Our actions have forced the government to gradually close the border,' said union chairwoman Winnie Yu, speaking after Lam's announcement. Yet, she added, the government 'has not directly responded to our demands.'
'We cannot see [Lam's] sincerity to shut down all the borders and to cut off the source of the virus,' Yu added.
Long lines formed at hospitals on Monday as nurses and doctors signed up at designated booths to register their participation in the strike. Across the city, residents wore white ribbons in solidarity with medical workers.
Employees in Hong Kong's financial district " which is quieter than usual as companies institute work-from-home arrangements to halt the spread of the virus " mounted a small lunchtime protest supporting the medical workers, reminiscent of demonstrations at the height of the political unrest late last year. Some wore full-face respirators.
Tony Ko, the chief executive of the Hospital Authority, said Monday that the strike was already affecting services. Cardiac surgeries have had to be rescheduled, he said, and a serious shortage of staff members has been reported in pediatric wards.
'We are seriously concerned about the situation,' he said. 'Patients may be put at unnecessary risk.'
Lam, eager to quash any perception that civil resistance can sway her government, said her decision to widen the border closures has 'absolutely nothing to do' with the medical workers' strike.

HHS tells Congress it may need $136 million more

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services notified Congress on Sunday it may need to transfer up to $136 million to help combat the fast-moving coronavirus epidemic, a new sign of how the White House has increased its response in recent days.
The notification came as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is quickly burning through $105 million that was set aside for emergency public-health responses to things such as the coronavirus.
The additional money would address growing demands on the CDC, HHS's Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and HHS's Office of Global Affairs, HHS confirmed Monday. About $75 million would be available for the CDC, $52-million for the ASPR and $8 million for the Office of Global Affairs.
The quiet but proactive effort to obtain more money reflects the White House's response to the coronavirus outbreak in recent days. The Trump administration has sought to play down risks to the public while working behind the scenes to bolster the government's response given how quickly the coronavirus has spread in China and worldwide.
HHS Secretary Alex Azar is overseeing the Trump administration's response to the epidemic, which has infected more than 17,000 people in China and more than 140 people in 23 other countries, including 11 people in the United States. On Friday, he announced broad new travel restrictions and quarantine rules to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in the United States.
Many of the White House's most aggressive steps to address the spread of the virus have come since Friday. The need for additional money is not unexpected, given the labor- and resource-intensive measures the CDC has had to take to respond to the epidemic in recent weeks. By law, HHS must wait 15 days after providing Congress notice to access the funding, an HHS representative said. 
'With the disease outbreak expanding rapidly in China, and more cases occurring in the United States, it is not possible to project exact funding needs weeks in advance,' said Katie McKeogh, an HHS spokeswoman. 'Out of an abundance of caution and to ensure HHS's ability to respond and adapt to a rapidly changing situation, HHS notified Congress that it may need to use the transfer authority at a future point in time to make up to an additional $136-million available.'
The CDC has used the initial $105 million for immediate planning and response, HHS said, including enhanced laboratory capacity, communication and education efforts, transportation, medical screening and monitoring of U.S. citizens returning from China. The agency has nearly 200 people working on the response, most of them at the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta, and it has the only lab in the country that is able to test all suspected cases of the virus. The agency has also sent teams to help states that have confirmed cases of the virus, including six in California, one in Washington state, one in Arizona, two in Illinois and one in Massachusetts. It also has had to send staff members to the U.S. airports that are screening passengers returning from China.
The initial $105 million that the CDC is using is made available to the agency through a congressional appropriations law. In 2019, Congress created the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund, which provides the agency money to respond to an outbreak immediately. HHS used some of the money set aside for 2019 and 2020 to respond to an Ebola outbreak in Congo, but there was more than $100 million remaining that the CDC tapped for the coronavirus response, a senior Democratic House aide said. HHS notified the House Appropriations Committee on Jan. 25 that the CDC was tapping the fund, the senior Democratic aide said.
The money HHS notified Congress about is separate from the congressional fund.
'As they should, the agencies on the front lines are using the funding and flexibility provided in the law to respond to the threat. We remain in close contact with them and stand ready to provide more resources if needed,' a Senate Republican aide said.
Both aides spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic.

China accuses U.S. of spreading fear, failing to offer aid

China on Monday accused the United States of contributing to public hysteria over the deadly novel coronavirus, as the struggle to contain the illness adds further strain to diplomatic relations that have grown more distrustful under the Trump administration.
The rapid spread of the virus has put Beijing on the defensive for what critics have called a slow initial response to contain it and a lack of transparency over the scale of the outbreak. In a briefing for reporters, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman attempted to deflect blame by citing an 'overreaction' from the U.S. government that has 'spread fear' and set a 'bad example' for other nations.
'The U.S. is turning from overconfidence to fear and overreaction,' said Hua Chunying, citing the Trump administration's decision to evacuate some U.S. Embassy personnel and impose a ban on Chinese travelers.
She asserted that the administration has not offered 'any substantial assistance' to combat the virus, which has infected more than 20,000 people in China and more than 150 in 23 other nations, including 11 in the United States.
The criticism highlighted a significant challenge for authorities on both sides as they scramble to identify, quarantine and treat victims in a bid to limit the fallout of a potential pandemic that could have economic ramifications. Though Beijing and Washington have deployed emergency resources to combat the public health threats, there remain significant gaps in communication, information sharing and trust between the two major powers at a time of increasing global competition on trade and security matters. 
'If you look at the whole competition with China framework, pandemics would be an instance where you would hope we can cooperate. No one has an interest in the virus spreading,' said Richard Fontaine, chief executive of the Center for a New American Security, who has advised Republican lawmakers on foreign policy.
Fontaine cited Hong Kong's decision to restrict some travel between the special administrative region, which has reported 15 cases of the infection, and the rest of China as evidence that the Trump administration's response has not been overheated. 
'The fact that they are criticizing the U.S. for undertaking a policy that even Hong Kong has put in place suggests that the merits of the case are not at issue " but that the 'American boogeyman' is something they can use to deflect blame,' he said.
The Trump administration offered a tempered response Monday. President Trump made no public remarks, while the State Department declined to comment. A senior administration official, in a statement, defended the government's actions as an aggressive effort to protect the American public. 
This official pointed to Beijing's belated decision to reverse course and allow U.S. experts to join a World Health Organization mission to China to learn more about the virus as a sign that cooperation remains viable.
'The United States appreciates China's efforts and continued coordination with public health officials across globe,' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to address the sensitive geopolitical situation. 
Though Beijing has moved to enact strict controls on travel in wide swaths of the country, the government has been faulted for reacting slowly and defensively over fear of the political fallout " an approach that allowed the illness to spread quickly before an emergency response was put in place. 
Behind the scenes, Trump aides said, the president and his advisers have gotten regular updates and case data from Beijing and fear that such cooperation would slow if they are publicly critical of China's efforts. 
Trump has sought to project a good working relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping since the two nations signed a 'phase one' trade deal last month after an extended and acrimonious period of escalating tariffs. 
Two weeks ago, the president thanked Xi in a tweet for China's efforts, though White House aides said Trump grew more alarmed Friday when he was briefed on how quickly the disease was spreading and the news that a Chicago woman, who contracted the illness in China, infected her spouse in the first instance of a person-to-person transmission in the United States. 
Tom Bossert, a former homeland security adviser, said Trump had been 'rightfully prudent' in enacting the more aggressive measures, including the travel restrictions, given China's history of failing to be transparent on viral pandemics, including the SARS outbreak nearly two decades ago.
'If he was looking to punish the Chinese economy further, he could have,' Bossert said. 'I understand why they're frustrated, but it looks to me he took a prudent step.' 
In the wake of the trade pact last month, Trump said he hoped to visit Xi in Beijing to start talks on the second phase of the deal. Aides said he still hopes to meet with the Chinese leader, though that appears unlikely anytime soon given Beijing's all-consuming emergency efforts to deal with the coronavirus.
In 2017, the Trump administration labeled China, along with Russia, as the United States' top strategic rivals in a new national security approach that aimed to reorient policy to be more confrontational and competitive. 
Gordon Chang, a China analyst who appears frequently on Fox Business Network, cautioned that the international pressure on China could prompt Beijing to 'lash out' after the illness is contained and said it was 'important for us to maintain the deterrence right now and make it clear to China that such language is unacceptable and that the United States will defend its interests.'
But Michael Pillsbury, a China expert at the conservative Hudson Institute who informally advises the White House on economic issues, said Trump had chosen not to 'rise to the bait.' 
'The official messaging is that we're trying to help China, that Trump and Xi have spoken and it's about cooperation,' Pillsbury said. 
For Trump, the domestic political imperative of demonstrating a robust response to the virus has grown more pronounced amid the mounting cases outside China's borders, even though the number is relatively small so far.
In her briefing, Hua, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, noted that the coronavirus outbreak was far less deadly than influenza in the United States, quoting estimates from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that 19 million people were infected and at least 10,000 died from the flu in the United States from the beginning of October to late January.
She complained that the United States was the first to evacuate diplomatic personnel from the city of Wuhan, where the novel coronavirus originated, and noted that the World Health Organization, a United Nations agency, 'continues to have confidence in China's capacity to control the outbreak.'
'There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,' said Hua, who conducted the briefing via the WeChat messaging app rather than the usual in-person news conference to avoid potential transmission of the virus.

Officials rush to house quarantined passengers in effort to contain virus
After a weekend of panicked calls and emergency meetings, federal and state officials were still struggling Monday with how to carry out stringent new travel restrictions ordered by the Trump administration and where to quarantine passengers arriving from China to control the spread of the coronavirus in the United States.
In interviews, state officials said the order came Friday with no advance notice and little planning.
The restrictions ban non-U.S. citizens who have recently visited China from entering the country and quarantine Americans who have visited Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, within the past 14 days. (Immediate family of U.S. citizens, permanent residents and flight crew are exempted from the entry ban.) The administration is also requiring screening and self-monitoring of symptoms for Americans who have recently visited other parts of China. All flights from China as of Sunday evening are being funneled to 11 airports, in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Atlanta, Honolulu, Newark, Detroit, Dallas and just outside the District.
Among the options being considered for housing quarantined travelers are hotels, military bases and trailers, officials said Monday. 
New York state health officials said one person who is not displaying symptoms will be quarantined until Wednesday because of travel history and exposure to someone with a confirmed case of coronavirus.
The hastily issued restrictions and ensuing scramble to execute them underscore how quickly health officials are trying to move to prevent the virus's spread in the United States as the crisis enters its second month. The World Health Organization reported 153 confirmed cases in 23 countries outside China, including 11 in the United States.
Within China, the country's National Health Commission reported Monday that there are 20,438 confirmed cases, including 15 in Hong Kong and eight in Macao. The self-governing island of Taiwan reported 10 cases. On the news, China's reopened stock market plunged about 8 percent on Monday. Economists revised the country's growth forecasts downward and warned about ripple effects on the global economy.
In another sign of the White House's escalating response, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services notified Congress on Sunday that it may need to transfer up to $136 million to help combat the fast-moving epidemic. The notification came as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is quickly draining the $105 million that was set aside for emergency public-health responses to infectious disease outbreaks.
'The way this was rolled out is concerning. This is not the kind of thing you want to do on the fly because that creates chaos,' said Hawaii Lt. Gov. Josh Green. 'When you rush, you make mistakes, and this isn't a case where we can afford mistakes.'
Flights carrying passengers subject to the new screening and quarantine requirements began arriving in the United States on Monday. It is not clear how many new people have been placed in quarantine or how many have been denied entry to the United States.
Local jurisdictions are responsible for quarantine once people leave airports, and authorities are struggling to implement a system they had less than three days to devise. On Sunday, federal, state and local officials spent hours on conference calls to work out plans for different scenarios amid much confusion, said one local public health official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly.
'There was no advance notice,' the official said. 'This has not been thought through.'
Green, who also works as an emergency doctor, said Hawaii's leaders did not know about the order ahead of a news conference by Trump administration officials on Friday.
'I got an emergency call from a friend in D.C. five minutes before, telling me about it,' Green said. Following the Friday news conference, Green said, federal officials hosted a hurried teleconference with leaders in states where the affected airports are located.
'The kind of questions people were asking were just basic things, like: What is your protocol for routing planes into our airports? What is CDC's standard for quarantine? Where are we supposed to put these people?' Green said.
On Monday, Green said officials in Hawaii were still waiting on the Defense Department to tell them whether they had a location to house people under quarantine. State health officials have identified three possible places but prefer to use a military location farther away from the general population. The lieutenant governor said he repeatedly asked federal officials to authorize military housing and finally got a spoken promise of a military location Monday night East Coast time. 
'We are an island state that is 80 percent dependent on tourism. This isn't a case where we can just put people up in hotels without great collateral risk,' Green said.
In Loudoun County, a Washington suburb that includes Dulles International Airport, officials said they want to make any quarantine as comfortable as possible. Depending on a person's travel history, quarantine could take place in someone's home or another location.
'There is not a lone location that has been chosen in Loudoun for this purpose,' said David Goodfriend, director of Loudoun County's Health Department. 'The best answer could be different for different individuals.'
Nancy Messonnier, the top official overseeing the CDC response, said Monday that federal officials are working with states to 'determine where travelers will be quarantined. Some states have already made plans for hotels' to be used as part of the state's response to control the virus's spread, she said.
CDC officials also did not receive much advance notice, according to an HHS official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly. Messonnier acknowledged that plans were put together 'on an incredibly tight timeline.'
Michael Fraser, chief executive of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said: 'This is fast-moving and we just learned about it Friday afternoon. We are working with federal partners and states and territories to assure they get the guidance they need to effectively monitor and potentially implement isolation or quarantine measures' in accordance with state and local laws and regulations.
Messonnier said the rapidly expanding cases in China and new information suggesting that a person with mild symptoms may be able to spread the disease were among 'worrisome data points' that justified the administration's escalated response.
There are 11 confirmed cases in the United States, and 82 people are being monitored, she said. Testing of suspected cases is expected to accelerate by the end of this week. A diagnostic test developed by CDC scientists was sent Monday to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be approved for emergency use by state labs. Currently, all specimens must be sent to CDC headquarters in Atlanta for the virus testing.
'This is an unprecedented situation and we have taken aggressive measures,' Messonnier said, noting that other countries as well as China also have taken aggressive measures. 'The goal is to slow this thing down before it gets into the United States.'
Under quarantine in a military base in California are 195 people who were evacuated from Wuhan, China, last week. State Department officials plan to evacuate more Americans from Wuhan, Messonnier said. Those evacuees will stay at facilities operated by the Defense Department, she said.
For commercial flights, officials initially announced seven airports that would handle passengers from China. Four more were added Sunday. Virginia was notified late Sunday that Dulles would be added.
At Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, health officials said they spent Sunday trying to develop protocols for screening travelers. As of Monday afternoon, they were still waiting for the CDC to issue final guidance for assessing and monitoring travelers.
At least a dozen countries have put travel restrictions on people coming from China.
Because of flights that have already been canceled, the majority of the 11 airports included in the new restrictions are no longer getting direct arrivals from China, transportation officials said. That may give many of them some breathing room to work out the logistics. Dulles, for example, has no more flights coming in from China but may still receive some travelers via connecting flights.
The airports that are still getting flights, and will likely face more pressing housing issues, are Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.
U.S. carriers will stop all direct service starting Wednesday.

ABSTRACT (ENGLISH) 
In China’s isolation, Brexit, and American politics, those who offer a helping hand can lessen the decoupling of ties.

FULL TEXT
A glance at recent headlines might leave the impression that much of the world is decoupling. Nations are cutting ties with China over a virus outbreak. Last week Britain split from the European Union. In the U.S., Democrats and Republicans are more divided than ever as impeachment comes to an end and primary voting starts for the 2020 elections.
Even the British royal family has its “Megxit” as Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, depart for North America.
Yet what is often missing in such stories are those on one side who recognize the suffering of the other and try to repair the breach with a measure of respect and compassion, even a helping hand.
Take Brexit, which has left a certain bitterness on either side of the English Channel.
In an open letter to the British people, French President Emmanuel Macron said “you are not leaving Europe” despite the lowering of the Union Jack outside the European Parliament on Jan. 31. He praised Britons as influential players in Europe. He offered to deepen ties on security and open a “new chapter ... based on the strength of our unrivaled ties.” He predicted Britain and continental Europe may end up closer than can be imagined.
In June the French leader plans to award London with the Legion of Honor in hopes of reviving cross-channel ties. Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU seeks an “unprecedented partnership” with Britain as the two sides start talks to negotiate a new trade relationship.
As for China, which faces criticism of its response to the coronavirus outbreak as well as extreme isolation as airline travel becomes restricted, many world leaders are stepping up to offer sympathy and aid.
President Donald Trump, for example, offered “any help that is necessary.” The EU made a similar offer. South Korea, Singapore, Japan, and several other countries are sending assistance. “If we help China deal with this, I think the problem becomes smaller for everyone else,” said Singapore’s health minister, Gan Kim Yong.
In the U.S., where partisanship seems at a peak, a number of countervailing forces are at work to challenge the nation’s rigid binary politics and to end a cycle of political revenge.
Dozen of nonpartisan citizen groups are trying to improve public discourse with humility and listening, even a sharing of personal vulnerability to modern life. New third parties such as Serve America Movement are getting on ballots. And as the Senate moves to acquit Mr. Trump, some senators plan to repair the damage to their institution by reaching across the aisle.
Perhaps the greatest challenge to the extreme polarization comes from the rise of independent voters. Their numbers are at a near-record high of 45%, up from 38% last October. While many independents lean left or right, they represent the possibility of a dialogue across differences and the exchange of ideas instead of insults. Many try to find the best in an opponent’s opinion and even be thankful for it.
Gratitude for those who disagree with you, writes scholar Arthur C. Brooks in his 2019 book, “Love Your Enemies,” is the best “contempt killer.” It shows respect and dignity which might then be reciprocated. Gratitude, generosity, humility, and listening can help recouple a people who are divided or end ruptures between nations.

The New Threat to Energy-Company Bonds: Virus Fears; Several newly issued energy bonds have sunk in the wake of a short-lived oil rally

FULL TEXT
The economic threat posed by the coronavirus is helping erode demand for energy-company debt just weeks after bond issuance in the sector surged, highlighting the virus's far-reaching effects on companies and financial markets.
Early last month, a surprise rally in the debt of energy companies allowed oil and gas businesses to issue the largest amount of speculative-grade bonds in one week since just before oil prices crashed in the fall of 2014.
No sooner had companies issued the bonds, however, than fears that the coronavirus will slow global growth sapped appetite for riskier debt—underscoring the good timing of the businesses that were able to push out looming debt payments but heightening the challenges for those that still need financing.
On Jan. 10, shale company Laredo Petroleum Inc. sold $400 million of 2028 unsecured bonds at par with a 10.125% interest rate, at the high end of what typically makes economic sense for companies. On Monday, those bonds were trading at around 89 cents on the dollar, implying Laredo would have had to pay an interest rate of more than 12% if it had waited to issue the debt, according to MarketAxess.
Overall, the average price of speculative-grade energy-company bonds has fallen to 89.67 cents on the dollar as of Friday, from a recent high of 92.54 cents on Jan. 16, pushing yields on the bonds to 8.96% from 7.99%, according to Bloomberg Barclays data. That comes after the yield had dropped from 9.71% in early December. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.
As usual, the movement of energy-company bonds has closely tracked oil and gas prices. The bonds rallied in December and early January when oil prices and a broad swath of lower-rated corporate bonds were also rising—buoyed by easing U.S.-China trade tensions and signals from the Federal Reserve that it wouldn't raise interest rates for an extended period.
The bonds, however, took a blow in mid-January when an abrupt shift in weather forecasts toward warmer temperatures triggered a drop in prices for natural gas , which many homeowners use for heating. Soon after, a Chinese health official confirmed the coronavirus had spread between humans , which also hit oil and gas prices and sparked broad selling of stocks and low-rated corporate bonds as investors reassessed the economic outlook.
Though relatively modest by the standards of recent years, the recent downturn in energy bonds is significant because even small margins matter for businesses at a time when oil and gas prices remain under constant pressure due to a persistent glut of the commodities.
Low oil and gas prices have long been considered good for the U.S. economy because they reduce prices at the gas pump for consumers as well as costs for businesses that rely on oil. That judgment, though, has become more complicated after the U.S. shale boom made energy production a larger share of the economy.
U.S. crude settled at $50.11 a barrel on Monday, pushing it into a bear market given its more than 20% decline from its recent peak of $63.27 on Jan. 6, when companies began their rush to sell bonds. U.S. natural-gas futures settled at $1.819 per million British thermal units, its lowest level since 2016.
"The market has changed a lot in the last couple weeks," said Dane Gregoris, vice president at analytics firm RS Energy Group. Many U.S. shale companies, he added, can be profitable at $60 oil but not necessarily at $55.
Before its bond sale last month, which also included $600 million of 2025 notes, Laredo was facing $800 million of bond principal payments in 2022 and 2023. Now, it has effectively pushed back its first maturity until 2025, making a near-term liquidity crunch much less likely.
Similarly, Range Resources Corp. on Jan. 10 sold $550 million of six-year bonds at par with a 9.25% coupon to help pay back bonds due in 2021 and 2022. On Monday, the new bonds traded at 87.938 cents on the dollar for a 12.139% yield, according to MarketAxess.
But the move left other companies in a more difficult position.
Last month, Whiting Petroleum Corp. was among those that analysts thought could be next in line to issue unsecured debt, provided demand for energy debt continued to improve.
From early December to early January, the yield on Whiting's existing bonds due in 2026 fell from around 19.4% to as low as 12.5%. Now, those bonds are back to yielding roughly 19%, narrowing the company's options as it faces roughly $1 billion of bond maturities over the next 13 months.
Another company affected by the rise of energy bond yields is Hilcorp Energy Co., which last week began approaching investors about issuing $1.5 billion of unsecured bonds to help fund its coming purchase of BP PLC's Alaska assets, according to people familiar with the matter.
The yield on Hilcorp's existing bonds due in 2028 fell to around 6.5% in early January but reached as high as 8.5% last week, according to MarketAxess.
Hilcorp's current plan is to fund its $5.6 billion purchase entirely with debt, including borrowings from a revolving credit line, and cash flow from the business. However, some investors said a further decline in energy-company bonds could put pressure on Hilcorp's billionaire owner Jeffery Hildebrand to contribute some of his own money to the financing effort.
Some bonds issued out of the energy sector last month have weathered the turbulence. WPX Energy Inc.'s new 4.5% notes due in 2030 traded Monday at 100.75 cents on the dollar, reflecting investors' confidence in the company, which is under a review for credit-rating upgrades pending its acquisition of Felix Energy LLC.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think energy companies could be affected by lack of investor interest in this sector? Join the conversation below.
With natural-gas prices recently reaching multiyear lows, some bonds issued by energy companies that rely heavily on natural-gas production, such as Range Resources, have been particularly hard hit by the recent selloff.
Still, some investors say the selling has been overdone in some cases.
Troy Johnson, a portfolio manager and director of fixed-income research at Segall Bryant &Hamill, said he had held on to 2025 Range Resources bonds because he thinks the company is strong enough to withstand the latest drop in commodities prices, especially after it reduced near-term debt maturities.
"If you have good assets, you just have to outlast the near-term cyclical impacts on natural-gas pricing, and we think they have the staying power to do that," he said.

Monday Sunrise Briefs: As Iowa votes, why Democrats call for unity

ABSTRACT (ENGLISH) 
Catch me up on the weekend news:

FULL TEXT
Calls for party unity came from Democratic candidates in Iowa this weekend. The field is still crowded, but they don’t want to repeat the disunity that some say cost them the 2016 election. Expect unity to be a continuing theme right through the Democratic Party national convention in July. The four candidates now leading the polls - Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Pete Buttigieg - represent both the progressive, liberal wing of the party and the more establishment, centrist wing. Monday’s Iowa caucuses could offer the first test of whether Democratic voters want a centrist candidate, who has “a better chance” of beating Trump, or a liberal candidate who truly represents the party’s core values. 
2. Fear can slow the global economy. Economists are now warning - and health officials agree - that some attempts to protect the public from the coronavirus in China may be ineffective and economically damaging. The Shanghai stock index tumbled 8 percent Monday. “When you stop planes and ships, trains and motor vehicles from moving, it starts to shut down the economy —and that can have a cascading effect throughout society,” Dr. Eric Toner at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said Saturday.  “Out of an abundance of caution,” Apple Inc. announced Saturday that it was temporarily closing all of its 42 stores in China. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft already have said they will temporarily shutter offices, and Starbucks and McDonald's have closed some outlets. Multiple airlines have announced that they would suspend flights to and from China, and several countries, including the U.S., imposed travel restrictions.
But World Health Organization Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said such restrictions can “cause more harm than good by hindering info-sharing, medical supply chains, and harming economies.” 
3. A true shift in leadership? Iraq’s ruling parties selected a new prime minister Saturday but it remains to be seen if street protesters will accept him. Mohammed Allawi pledged to form a representative government, hold early parliamentary elections, and ensure justice for protest-related violence –all key demands of protesters.  Mr. Allawi has the backing of the powerful Shiite cleric, Muqtada al-Sadr. The cleric recently staged an anti-U.S. rally that brought tens of thousands to the street. “The groups we call pro-Iranian ... are taking a backseat now as al-Sadr emerges as more active in shaping the new government,” Harith Hasan, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, told the Associated Press. More than 480 people have died and nearly 30,000 have been wounded in violent protests since October.
Look Ahead
Monday, Feb. 3.
Democracy waypoints: The Iowa caucuses should provide our first voter ballots and official feedback on the Democratic presidential primary race.
Tuesday, Feb. 4
State of the Union: In his annual speech before the U.S. Congress, President Trump will highlight the strong economy, new trade agreements, tighter immigration rules. and lower prescription drug costs, say White House officials.
Wednesday, Feb. 5
Impeachment trial ends: Most analysts expect President Trump has the Senate votes to be acquitted of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress charges. 
Friday, Feb. 7
Last call before the N.H. primary: Seven Democratic candidates have qualified to square off in an ABC-TV debate at 8 p.m., just four days before the New Hampshire primary vote. It's the first of three TV debates between Democratic candidates in February.
Saturday, Feb. 8.
Irish leadership vote: Parliamentary elections are scheduled with Prime Minister Leo Varadkar’s Fine Gael party and the center-right Fianna Fail closely matched in opinion polls. Brexit (i.e. trade with Europe), the economy, health care, and affordable housing are key issues.
Generosity Watch
A Super Bowl party with a higher purpose. Meir Kalmanson invited four homeless guys to a friend’s Super Bowl party in 2017 - and made a video of it. That simple idea multiplied into 20 “Super Soul Parties” for the homeless yesterday (Sunday) in 20 U.S. cities.  
A Orthodox Jew and vlogger known as “Meir Kay,” Kalmanson makes “positivity” videos, including one where he gave kids a dollar and asked them to choose between buying ice cream or giving it to someone who is homeless.  The New York Jewish Week describes Kalmanson as “a YouTuber, social media influencer, storyteller and prankster extraordinaire. His videos have received more than 350 million views and have been translated into several foreign languages. His fan base of over 1 million followers spans the globe, from Libya to the Philippines and Australia.”
On Super Bowl Sunday, his mission was to build connections and empathy for people without a roof. It’s about giving a higher purpose for a national "holiday" that has become almost as iconic in America as Thanksgiving. "Ultimately, the mission of the Super Bowl party is less about the party," Kalmanson told CNN. "It is just the stage for human beings to come together, put ... aside our differences, our struggles or challenges, and connect on a human level to show love, compassion."

First death from virus outside of China

The first death outside China from the new coronavirus was recorded Sunday in the Philippines, as countries around the world evacuated hundreds of their citizens from the infection zone and Chinese authorities completed a new, rapidly constructed 1,000-bed hospital for victims of the outbreak. 
Chinese authorities also delayed the reopening of schools in the hardest-hit province and tightened the quarantine in one city by allowing only one family member to venture out to buy supplies.
The Philippine Health Department said a 44-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan, the city at the center of the crisis, was hospitalized Jan. 25 with a fever, cough and sore throat and died after developing severe pneumonia. The man's 38-year-old female companion, also from Wuhan, tested positive for the virus as well and remained hospitalized in isolation in Manila.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte approved a ban on the entry of all noncitizens from China. The U.S., Japan, Singapore and Australia have imposed similar restrictions despite criticism from China and an assessment from the World Health Organization that such measures were unnecessarily hurting trade and travel.
The death toll in China climbed to 361, and the number of cases worldwide surged 2,829 new cases for a total of 17,205, according to China's National Health Commission and other nations. The vast majority of those infected are in China; about 150 cases have been reported in two dozen other countries.
The U.S. total rose to 11 cases, mostly involving recent travel to Wuhan.
A hospital specially built to handle coronavirus patients in Wuhan is expected to open Monday, 10 days after construction began. A second hospital is set to open soon after.
Also, six officials in the city of Huanggang, next to Wuhan in Hubei province, were fired over "poor performance" in handling the outbreak, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It cited the mayor as saying the city's "capabilities to treat the patients remained inadequate and there is a severe shortage in medical supplies such as protective suits and medical masks."
The trading and manufacturing center of Wenzhou, with nearly 10 million people in coastal Zhejiang province, confined people to their homes, allowing only one family member to venture out every other day to buy necessary supplies. Huanggang, home to 7 million people, imposed similar measures Saturday.
With no end in sight to the outbreak, authorities in Hubei and elsewhere have extended the Lunar New Year holiday break, due to end this week, well into February to try to keep people at home and reduce the spread of the virus. All Hubei schools are postponing the start of the new term r until further notice.
Wenzhou, situated about 500 miles from Wuhan, put off the reopening of government offices until Feb. 9, businesses until Feb. 17 and schools until March 1. The city has reported 241 confirmed cases of the virus, one of the highest levels outside Hubei.
Similar measures have been announced in the provinces and cities of Heilongjiang, Shandong, Guizhou, Hebei and Hunan, while the major cities of Shanghai and Beijing have also closed schools and public offices indefinitely.
Despite its own drastic travel restrictions, China has chafed at those imposed by foreign governments, criticizing Washington's order barring entry to most noncitizens who visited China in the past two weeks. Apart from damaging China's international reputation, such steps could worsen a domestic economy already growing at its lowest rate in decades.
The crisis is the latest to confront Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who has been beset by months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong, the reelection of Taiwan's pro-independence president and criticism over human rights violations in the traditionally Muslim territory of Xinjiang.
New Zealand announced Sunday it is temporarily barring travelers from China to protect the South Pacific region from the virus. The 14-day ban applies to foreigners leaving China but not to New Zealand residents. New Zealand also raised its travel advice for China to "Do not travel," the highest level.
Qatar Airways joined the growing number of airlines suspending flights to mainland China. Indonesia and Oman also halted flights, as did Saudi Arabia's flagship national carrier, Saudia.
Saudi Arabia's state-run media reported that 10 Saudi students were evacuated from Wuhan on a special flight. It said the students would be screened on arrival and quarantined for 14 days.
Europe so far has 25 people infected with the virus. The German Red Cross reported two more cases there on Sunday, both German citizens who were airlifted from Wuhan on Saturday on a military transport carrying 128 people. Eight earlier cases in Germany were all linked to an auto parts factory.
France has six cases; Russia, Italy and Britain have two each, and Finland, Sweden and Spain each have one.
The Trump administration's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said,"Right now, there's no reason for Americans to panic."
The number of confirmed cases will keep growing because thousands of specimens from suspected cases have yet to be tested, said the WHO representative in Beijing, Gauden Galea.

Oil Skids Into Bear Market, While Stocks Rebound; Crude benchmarks drop despite Saudi push for production cuts

U.S. stocks rebounded Monday after last week's steep decline, though oil prices continued to slide on concerns that China's coronavirus outbreak will reduce energy consumption.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 143.78 points, or 0.5%, to 28399.81, reversing course from a sharp selloff last week. The S&P 500 gained 23.40, or 0.7%, to 3248.92. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 122.47, or 1.3%, to 9273.40.
With the bounce, the S&P 500 is back in positive territory for the year. A big drop Friday—the worst day for the broad-based index since August—had briefly wiped out its year-to-date gains for 2020.
Oil prices, meanwhile, fell on worries that the virus will continue to disrupt the world's second-largest economy. U.S. crude oil futures fell $1.45, or 2.8%, to settle at $50.11 a barrel on Monday. They are now down more than 20% from their recent peak in early January.
Futures on Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell $2.17, or 3.8% to $54.45 a barrel, their lowest settle in more than a year and more than 20% below where they were in September.
Saudi Arabia is pushing for significant oil-production cuts in a bid to prop up prices, according to OPEC officials. Representatives of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are set to meet Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss next steps.
U.S. stock investors may have seen Friday's selloff as a buying opportunity, said Michael Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners. He noted that with past outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, stocks have tended to drop initially, only to bounce back once the rate of new infections slows.

* Saudis Weigh Oil Cuts in Response to Virus 
"Once you see a slowdown in the uptick of new cases, historically the market has generally done quite well after that," Mr. Mullaney said.
Chinese authorities have quarantined millions of people to contain the virus, which has infected more than 17,000 people and has been linked to more than 360 deaths. Major global airlines have suspended flights to mainland China.
Chinese markets tumbled sharply Monday, the first day of trading following the extended Lunar New Year break. The Shanghai Composite Index closed 7.7% lower in its steepest drop since August 2015, with many stocks dropping by the maximum 10% that is allowed. But the move had been largely expected because Chinese markets closed just as the outbreak was beginning to draw widespread attention.
Investors were also closely watching Monday's presidential caucuses in Iowa for insights into whether a candidate who supports a bigger role for government may beat out rival Democratic contenders. The state is expected to play a key role in winnowing down the field of Democratic candidates as the party chooses who will take on President Trump in November.
"Markets have previously reacted quite strongly when left-wing populist Democratic candidates have performed well," said Oliver Jones, market economist at Capital Economics.
In an upbeat sign for the U.S. economy, new data showed the U.S. factory sector improved in January, moving into expansionary territory for the first time since July.
The Institute for Supply Management said Monday that its manufacturing index rose to 50.9 in January from 47.2 in December. Readings above 50 indicate activity is expanding across the manufacturing sector, while those below 50 signal contraction. Manufacturing has been a weak spot for the U.S. economy, which has continued growing over the past year largely on the strength of consumer spending.
In corporate news, Tesla shares jumped $129.43, or 20%, to a record close of $780 after analysts at Argus Research and ARK Invest raised their price targets for the electric-car maker.
Gilead Sciences climbed $3.16, or 5%, to $66.36. The drugmaker on Friday said it had provided doses of an experimental antiviral drug to doctors for the emergency treatment of a small number of patients infected by the coronavirus.
Exxon Mobil shares slid $1.39, or 2.2%, to $60.73 after analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their rating on the energy giant to "sell" from "neutral." Slumping oil prices also weighed on Exxon, making it the second-worst performer in the Dow on Monday.
In the U.K., the British pound fell 1.6% against the U.S. dollar. The move reflected concerns about fresh trade talks between the European Union and the U.K., said Jordan Rochester, a foreign-exchange strategist at Nomura Holdings.
The U.K. formally exited the EU Friday and entered into a transition period. Both sides fired opening salvos on Monday as they begin the complex negotiations that will determine the terms of their future relationship.
The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.2%.
"We expect a tough talk in the opening rounds of the Brexit talks," Mr. Rochester said. "Today, the EU and the U.K. are setting out their stalls."

World News: Chinese Travelers Greeted With Suspicion

As a new coronavirus spreads beyond China and foreign governments begin to set entry bans, Chinese travelers and communities overseas are becoming targets for anger, sometimes in ways that are amplifying long-held biases and anti-Chinese sentiment.
Tourists from southern China spent an evening holed up in their hotel in Bukittinggi, a scenic town on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, last weekend. Outside, demonstrators wearing face masks held up a banner rejecting the arrival of the Chinese visitors and urging vigilance about the virus.
The men agreed to end their demonstration when police assured them the visitors wouldn't leave the hotel until their departure from the town the following day, saidYulhendri Mangkuto, one of the demonstrators. The tourists' plans to visit another town were canceled after residents there also raised objections, according to a tourism official.
In the capital, Jakarta, a government-appointed ombudsman, Laode Ida, said last week that Chinese workers should be denied access to Indonesia. "There's a flow of lots of laborers from China to Indonesia; there should be a moratorium," he said.
The World Health Organization, which declared a global public health emergency after the number of cases rose above 8,000 and reached around 20 countries, has said there is no reason to limit travel or trade because of the outbreak. Still, foreign governments, including some that have yet to report a confirmed case, have imposed restrictions or bans on entry for Chinese nationals or travelers from China.
Singapore, after having banned travelers from Hubei, on Friday became the first Southeast Asian nation to bar foreign nationals who had been in China in the past 14 days and began denying visas to all Chinese passport holders. The country has 18 confirmed cases, one of the highest totals outside China.
Lawrence Wong, co-chair of a Singapore government task force on the coronavirus, said the additional restrictions were to "limit the number of new imported cases here and to reduce the risk of community spread in Singapore."
The governments have said they were acting to reduce risk of infection for their citizens. But some health experts say these responses aren't helpful and contradict the WHO's guidance to not limit travel.
"What happens is that there is a lot of political pressure to do something and that something always ends up being travel bans, which makes things paradoxically worse," in part because it could make it harder to get medical resources into China, Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, said.
China's foreign ministry on Friday said Hubei natives were facing "actual difficulties" overseas and would repatriate citizens who wanted to return to the country. It criticized the U.S. restrictions.
"Just as the WHO recommended against travel restrictions, the U.S. rushed to go in the opposite way. Certainly not a gesture of goodwill," a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said Friday.
In Indonesia and other countries in Southeast Asia, inflows of Chinese nationals to build infrastructure and work in Chinese-owned factories have long stoked tensions. Charlotte Setijadi, a researcher who studies ethnic Chinese populations in South East Asia at Singapore Management University, said the notion that the virus was caused by eating nonconventional animals like bat has amplified distrust of Chinese.
"To many with already existing anti-Chinese sentiments, the threat is now not just ideological or political but physical," she said.
The suspected source of the virus is a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan where some vendors sell carcasses and live specimens of wild animals. Social-media posts ridiculing supposed Chinese dietary habits have spread rapidly. While China does have a long tradition of eating wildlife, some of the alleged habits are as exotic among the Chinese.
Some businesses have sought to exclude Chinese people. A hotel in Da Nang in Vietnam turned back guests from China who had reserved a room a month earlier and canceled other reservations. Its director said in a Facebook post that he was worried about Chinese travelers infecting his staff or other guests.
A shop outside Tokyo put a "No entry for Chinese" sign up last week. Its owner couldn't be reached for comment.

World News: Experts Chase Answers on Virus's Spread

BEIJING -- Public-health experts around the world have been crunching numbers about the advance of China's dangerous new coronavirus to estimate how far and fast it could spread.
Studies published in recent days say the new virus appears to be more contagious than seasonal flu and on par with the similar pathogen behind an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002 and 2003. The new virus's mortality rate, however, is far below that of SARS.
China says that as of Sunday there were 5,142 infected people in Wuhan, the locked-down city where the outbreak began. Some scientists estimate based on statistical models that the number could be in the tens of thousands.
Reflecting those concerns, the Pentagon said it was preparing four military bases, in California, Colorado and Texas, as centers for overseas travelers who are screened and identified as needing to be quarantined. It said it acted at the request of the Department of Health and Human Services, and was prepared to provide quarters for up to 1,000 people through the end of February.
As health authorities race to control the outbreak, they are also scrambling to figure out, based on imperfect data, how the virus is transmitted, the length of the incubation period and the degree to which people without symptoms can spread the disease.
China's health commission says incubation is generally between three and seven days, with the longest period being 14 days, and that people can spread the virus before appearing ill. That makes a two-week quarantine an important prevention measure -- and casts doubt on the efficacy of temperature checks, the main screening method at immigration and other checkpoints.
"For a given level of transmissibility, more asymptomatic transmission makes a disease harder to control," said Christl A. Donnelly, a professor at University of Oxford and Imperial College London.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which warns against nonessential travel to China, says it isn't clear how easily or sustainably the virus is spreading between people, but notes its ability to spread from infected patients without symptoms to close contacts within about 6 feet.
A study led by a researcher from Boston's Northeastern University -- using mathematical probability models based on travel patterns and confirmed international cases -- estimated the median number of infections in Wuhan at 31,200 as of Wednesday, compared with that day's official tally of 2,261.
Professors at the University of Hong Kong using similar methods published a study in the Lancet on Friday that estimated there were 75,815 infected in Wuhan as of Jan. 25, when official counts were still in the hundreds.
"We think only 1 in 20 people who are getting infected are actually being diagnosed" in Wuhan, said Jonathan M. Read, lead author of a study from Britain's Lancaster University that also put Wuhan numbers in the tens of thousands as of Jan. 22. "It's quite a bit more transmissible than seasonal flu."
Several recent studies published by scientists estimate that each person infected will, on average, infect two to three others. Epidemiologists call that the reproduction number.
A reproduction number over 2 suggests an epidemic will expand rapidly, while below 1 suggests the problem is dwindling. Estimates of the reproduction number differ widely, with some studies using probability models and others based on regression analysis of cases over different time periods.
Still, "they all point in the same direction," said Christian L. Althaus, an epidemiologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland who co-wrote a study estimating the basic reproduction number of the virus at 2.2. "There is a potential threat of a global pandemic if this reproduction number cannot be reduced."
In Japan, a local bus driver in his 60s tested positive after he drove tourists from Wuhan, none of whom had exhibited severe symptoms. In Germany, four employees at an auto-parts supplier contracted the virus after attending a training session with a colleague from China, according to the company. The Chinese woman didn't exhibit symptoms, but started feeling ill on her flight home, where she tested positive for the new coronavirus.
A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Chinese authors, including at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, says the virus spread between people as early as mid-December. The researchers analyzed 425 patients, with more than half the cases linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market where authorities believe the virus first spread to humans from wild animals.
The researchers started identifying and collecting cases around the start of the year, by interviewing patients, relatives and other close contacts. They estimated the reproduction number at 2.2 and said that the majority of patients weren't hospitalized until after five days of being ill.
Researchers of recent studies cautioned that even their estimates of the virus's reproduction number are based on early and incomplete data, and only assess its potential to spread before travel restrictions and other control measures begin.
Chinese officials have said the outbreak could peak or even begin to subside by Feb. 8, though some overseas experts have suggested the outbreak might not peak for several weeks.
As yet, there are no vaccines for the new coronavirus, so Chinese authorities are relying on physical intervention measures, including locking down entire cities and forced quarantine.

Virus forces U.S. firms to confront life without China

The battle to contain the Chinese coronavirus threatens to cut off U.S. companies from parts and materials they need to produce iPhones, automobiles and appliances and drugs to treat medical conditions including Alzheimer's disease, high blood pressure and malaria.
Some of the United States' best-known manufacturers such as General Electric, Caterpillar and the Big Three automakers, along with many smaller American businesses, depend on what is made in Chinese factories.
Now, they confront life without those items. Major airlines in the United States and Europe are halting their cargo and passenger flights to China for up to two months. Recent visitors to the country are barred from entering the United States.
After four decades of growing integration with the rest of the world, China almost overnight has become an economic island. Its temporary isolation " no one knows for how long " will hurt companies that depend upon Chinese inputs as well as those that sell to Chinese customers.
Consumer electronics makers are among the most vulnerable, because many game consoles, smartphones and tablets are made in China. On Saturday, Apple announced that it had closed all of its corporate offices and retail stores in China " where it booked $44-billion in sales last year " until Feb.-9 because of the virus.
'The concern is not the zombie apocalypse with people dying in the streets. The concern is that a huge chunk of the global economy gets put out of commission as people wait it out,' said Patrick Chovanec, managing director at Silvercrest Asset Management in New York.
White House advisers so far have played down the disease's effects, with President Trump's top economic aide, Larry Kudlow, saying last week that he expects the virus to have 'no material impact' on the U.S. economy. 
Most Wall Street economists, likewise, say the economic damage will be limited. Economists at JPMorgan Chase Bank on Friday cut their first-quarter global growth estimate by 0.3-percentage points to 2.3-percent. But they predicted a swift rebound that would return China and the global economy to their pre-crisis trends by midyear. 
The sanguine forecasts are based in part on a disease outbreak from 2003: The Chinese economy recovered quickly after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another fatal flulike infection, temporarily emptied offices and factories.
But there is no guarantee that the coronavirus will trace a similar path. Already, there are indications that while the new virus is less lethal than SARS, it spreads more easily.
China's $14-trillion economy also is four times as large as it was 17 years ago and far more globalized. About 150-million Chinese business executives and tourists took an international flight in 2018, the most recent data available, more than seven times the 2003 figure, according to JPMorgan. Globally, the number of shipping containers moving among the world's ports has almost tripled, according to the United Nations.
In Youngstown, Ohio, Phantom Fireworks worries that a prolonged hiatus at its Chinese supplier may prevent it from importing sufficient inventory for the Independence Day celebration.
Though its vendor in Liuyang, about 200 miles from Wuhan, is scheduled to reopen on Feb.-10, Phantom executives say the shutdown will probably last at least an additional week and perhaps several more. Chinese officials also closed the southern port of Beihai late last week, severing a key export link. Few alternative producers exist outside China.
'We're in a very precarious situation, no question about it,' said Alan Zoldan, the company's executive vice president. 'I'm not very confident at all. It's pretty unprecedented territory.'
Precautions that the Chinese and American governments are taking to stop the spread of the coronavirus, justified on grounds of medical necessity, are raising the potential economic toll. An official quarantine will keep factories across much of China, closed since Jan.-24 for the Lunar New Year holiday, shut for at least one more week, maybe longer.
Three major U.S. airlines " United, American and Delta " suspended flights to China until the end of March. American grounded its planes immediately, one day after its flight attendants union sued the company, arguing that the virus made such trips unsafe. United and Delta will stop flying at the end of the week.
That means trans-Pacific airfreight shipments will be limited for at least two months even if Chinese factories return to normal operations before then. (Fed Ex says that for now it is continuing its flights.) Some U.S. companies are drafting contingency plans for supply disruptions that linger into April or May, according to Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council.
China is the largest export destination for 33 countries and the top source of imported goods for 65, including the United States, according to a 2019 McKinsey Global Institute study.
The accumulating uncertainty is unnerving investors. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 600-points, or 2.1-percent, on Friday.
The U.S. dependence on China was on display two years ago when American companies first sought to dissuade the Trump administration from imposing tariffs on Chinese goods.
Among those lobbying for relief was GE, which relies on its Chinese factories for parts to produce CT scanners, ultrasound and X-ray machines, oil field pumps, valves and motors, and aircraft engine components.
'There are certain inputs that cannot be readily sourced outside China,' Del Renigar, a top official in GE's Washington office, wrote to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.
Finding a replacement for Chinese suppliers would not be easy. Dayco, a maker of engine parts and drive systems in Troy, Mich., said it would need two years to qualify new U.S. suppliers and to secure the needed approvals from its customers to use them.
Prinston Pharmaceuticals of Cranbury, N.J., depends on Chinese ingredients to make medications to treat high blood pressure, Alzheimer's and depression. Novus Pharmaceuticals said its Chinese plant was the only source approved by the Food and Drug Administration for coartem tablets, a treatment for malaria.
Electronic component maker AVX of Fountain Inn, S.C., produces ceramic capacitors at its plants in Tianjin and Shenzhen, which its industrial customers in the United States use in automobiles, microwave ovens, washing machines, radios and television sets.
The impact of an interruption in Chinese supplies will depend on the duration of any cutoff, which is unknowable, and the size of current inventories, which companies generally do not disclose.
The number of people with the coronavirus has soared above 14,000, and more than 300 Chinese citizens have died. In response, Trump on Friday declared a public health emergency and barred foreign nationals who had been to China in the past 14-days from entering the United States. American citizens returning from the country will be subject to health screening and up to 14 days in quarantine.
The president's decision came one day after the State Department warned U.S. citizens against all travel to China and the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
China, which in recent years accounted for about one-third of global growth, is now radiating economic weakness. The immediate impact of the health crisis will slow its domestic economy. First-quarter growth will dip to an annual rate of 5.2-percent, down from 6-percent in the final three months of last year, the most abrupt slowdown in nearly 10-years, according to PNC Bank.
'It'll bounce back when it's over,' said Allen, the U.S.-China Business Council president. 'But we don't know when it will be over.'
Chinese consumers sheltering in their homes rather than engaging in traditional holiday activities will spend less, while factory closures affecting millions of workers threaten parts shortages for American electronics or auto plants, economists said.
In one sign that the virus will have enduring effects across the world's second-largest economy, the Ladies Professional Golf Association late last week canceled the March-5-8 Blue Bay golf tournament on Hainan Island. That's about 1,000 miles from Wuhan, where the virus originated.
More than 50-million Chinese residents remain under a lockdown. The government already extended the Lunar New Year holiday to Monday. Factories in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, have been ordered closed through Feb.-13. Other provinces plan to restart production on Feb.-10.
'We believe there will be a disturbance at least until the end of February and possibly into mid-March,' said Sebastien Breteau, chief executive of QIMA, a supply-chain consultancy. 'We are not very optimistic.'
More than 450 U.S. importers use suppliers in Hubei province, according to London-based Panjiva. Electronics manufacturers rely on Chinese suppliers for up to 50-percent of their components, while automakers get 15-percent from China, according to Chris Rogers, a Panjiva supply-chain specialist.
Some U.S. and global manufacturers will face higher costs even after their Chinese suppliers resume normal operations. Airline cutbacks will mean less space available for the industrial shipments " known as 'belly cargo' " that travel in the hold of commercial jetliners.
'The scale of the airline cutbacks really caught my attention,' said Phil Levy, chief economist for freight forwarder Flexport. 'This is a big network. You carve China out of it and it's going to affect goods to Europe and goods to the U.S.'
As health officials fight the virus, the earliest and most severe economic consequences will be felt by China's Asian neighbors. Countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines are tied into production networks centered on Chinese manufacturers and also have benefited from the past decade's boom in Chinese tourism.
Aftershocks also are certain to be felt by major commodity-producing nations, such as Australia, which supplies China with much of its iron ore. The Baltic Dry Index, a gauge of bulk shipping costs, fell Friday for the 10th consecutive session and is now down 49-percent this year.
Of the advanced economies, nearby Japan and export-dependent Germany will feel the greatest chill.
Conventional economic forecasting is ill-equipped to calculate the impact of such an unpredictable health emergency, said Torsten Slok, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities. His baseline model for the U.S. economy relies on 200 equations.
'I just don't know which equation I should be putting this in,' he said. 'I just don't have a good framework for assessing the risk.'

It's relentless, isn't it? 
When you read the sentence above, what popped to mind? What is the "it" that just won't stop, that won't give you a break, that makes it hard to breathe and think?
If you live in the Midwest, the "it" may be the relentlessly gray weather, which, no matter how hard you try to love it -- I've been trying -- settles on your brain like an elephant.
If you live anywhere in the United States, the "it" may be the argument over a president who has abused his power but who is poised to escape conviction at his impeachment trial.
Or maybe the relentless "it" is the huge, shape-shifting blob of what we call "news."
Wildfires rage, floodwaters rise, Facebook spies, plastic pollutes the ocean.
The great basketball player Kobe Bryant and his daughter are killed in a helicopter crash.
The coronavirus spreads.
You're not worried about the coronavirus yet? I wasn't either -- not on a personal level -- until a reliably sensible Chicago friend told me on Friday she'd been shopping for masks.
"I found myself on Amazon trying to buy an N95 mask," she said. "And they were out of the best and most expensive ones. And I've wasted a lot of time today trying to find somewhere to get them. Which is probably useless and crazy. But fear is such a weird thing, maybe more contagious than coronavirus."
Fear is one consequence of relentless bad news. And fear makes everything else seem more relentless.
re·lent·less
adjective
Showing or promising no abatement of severity, intensity, strength or pace. Oppressively constant. Incessant.
The word has been pecking at my mind lately because I hear it so often, in conversations and in the news. Its use ranges from the relentless rise of carbon dioxide to the relentlessness of email.
"I just want some relief from the relentlessness of it all," I heard someone say.
Occasionally something good is called relentless. Relentless optimism. Relentless pursuit of justice. I'd say California Congressman Adam Schiff, the lead prosecutor during President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, was relentless in the good way while laying out the case that the country is endangered by this president who blatantly used his office to help ensure his reelection.
Schiff's detractors would, of course, disagree, and they're relentless in depicting the congressman in a harsh light, frequently with insults.
Insults are relentless too, aren't they? No matter what the topic these days -- a movie, a novel, a TV show -- public insult too often takes the place of meaningful argument. Every argument gives life to a relentless mob. The online mobs threaten and taunt, and we have to wonder, "Are human beings really this awful? This relentlessly awful?"
We have to keep believing that they -- we -- aren't as bad as it so often seems, but that belief is challenged in a relentlessly connected world.
Relentless connection is part of the problem. We're connected all the time now -- by news media, social media, email -- and the feeling that we can't get away from all those voices, all those opinions, can leave us feeling overwhelmed and threatened.
The incessant noise can make us feel like hostages, trapped by forces over which we have no control.
How to escape? And to where?
I once read an article that explained the psychological benefit of partitions in airplanes. The article contended that partitions aren't merely to separate the first-class swells from the riffraff. They exist to create an illusion of space, the sense that there's somewhere else to go.
If you're the poor person in seat 32E, for example, you can look out and see the mysterious vista of first class up ahead. Rather than feeling you're trapped in a little flying metal tube, you comfort yourself with the thought that there's lot of space out there, and you could go there if you wanted.
That's the relief so many of us are seeking -- at least the illusion that we're not trapped.
Life can be hard. That's always been true. Avoiding all difficulty and disagreement isn't possible or desirable.
But when I think about the relentlessness that's jangling so many of our minds right now, I think: We need to build better partitions. Look for ways to create a sense of space in our lives, free of the relentless noise.
Some days that relief is as simple -- and as hard -- as turning off all the media and going outside to look at trees, even if the sky is gray.

Our fears are as close as the nearest TV

There is so much to fear in this world and in this city. It is hard to escape. 
It was so much simpler when Franklin D. Roosevelt, delivering his first inaugural address as president in 1933, said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."
Roosevelt had never watched TV and was thus not daily bombarded with its frightening images, whether of the fictional, all too real or relatively benign type ("Blizzard Watch"). Fostering our fears and fueling our collective sense of dread, TV delivers, and millions eagerly accept.
Consider two programs currently available for your viewing.
"The Outsider" is based on a novel by that master of horror and fear and unease. His name is, of course, Stephen King and this series premiered on HBO some weeks ago. In its four episodes to date (No. 5 airs Sunday) it has provided some terrific acting, a darkly distinctive visual style, a pile of bodies and plenty of reasons for bad dreams.
It begins with the body of a dead young boy, found in the woods, bloody and abused. Detective Ralph Anderson (Ben Mendelsohn) begins to gather evidence and all of it points to the killer being his friend Terry Maitland (Jason Bateman, who directed the first two episodes), a husband, father and Little League coach. He is arrested, swears his innocence and offers very solid proof that he was not in town the day of the murder.
What follows, having seen the first four of the show's 10 episodes, is captivating and, yes, frightening. Other people die, plenty of them and in all manner of ways, and things get especially enigmatic (some might think confusing), especially after special investigator Holly Gibney (Cynthia Erivo, an Academy Award nominee for her title role in "Harriet") gets involved, making good if unnerving use of her extrasensory-perception abilities. With each spooky step she appears to be guiding viewers onto a supernatural highway.
Having read the novel, I know where we are headed. Or think I do, because series creator Richard Price is nothing if not imaginative. The author of such fine novels as "The Wanderers" and "The Lush Life," he's been a creative force of such television shows as "The Night Of" and "The Deuce." He wrote most of this series's episodes, getting artful aide from another acclaimed novelist, Dennis Lehane. Together and with others they have -- so far -- effectively combined the elements of a police procedural with a paranormal excursion.
They benefit greatly by fine acting from their cast, notably Mendelsohn; Julianne Nicholson as Terry's wife, Glory; Mare Winningham as Anderson's wife; Bateman, who is also an executive producer; and Erivo, who is, in a word, captivating.
They all are responsible for helping build a sense of foreboding, as is a nameless hooded character lurking at the edges of the action. Start watching and you are likely to get hooked until the end, even if you have to consult a dictionary for the definition of doppelganger, which is -- I'll save you some time -- "an apparition or double of a living person."
While doppelgangers may be the stuff of legend, pandemics are very real, and Netflix provides "Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak," a six-part streaming documentary series that arrives on the heels of the coronavirus, which is so dominating headlines and news flashes that it makes this series frighteningly relevant, if not wholly satisfying.
It begins with a search in a suspected mass 1918 grave site in Pennsylvania and the unsettling fact that World War I soldiers returning from battle helped spread the Spanish flu virus so widely that more than 100 million people died worldwide.
Though much of its focus is on the U.S., the program traverses the globe to explore the possible sources that could cause the next devastating influenza epidemic. In India, Vietnam, Guatemala, Lebanon, Egypt and the U.S./Mexico border, it examines worldwide health care preparations (or lack thereof) in place to combat diseases and explores what many are doing to try to prevent disaster.
The series is filled with facts, peppered with such alarming and chilling sentences as these:
"A future flu pandemic would likely kill hundreds of millions of people"
"All it would take is one person to spread a virus around the globe."
"When we talk about another flu pandemic happening, it's not a matter of if, but when."
There is a palpable, and understandable, sense of urgency as the program punctuates the need to prepare against epidemics and explores the expensive quest to create a universal flu vaccine. This is powerfully captured in Jake Glanville, the founder of a biotech company called Distributed Bio. He and his colleagues are working to create just such a vaccine, a mission made more difficult because it is completely funded out of pocket.
He is among the show's many heroes, who come in the shape of doctors and scientists battling against such foes as underfunding in research and health care, those of the vociferous anti-vaxxer movement, misinformation and political red tape. It is sad to listen to Holly Goracke, the only doctor on her shift at a rural Oklahoma hospital, wonder if such small facilities as hers might be ignored in the face of an outbreak.
Yes, this series will fuel some of your fears. The coronavirus is not mentioned, but given how frequently it peppers current news, it will surely be lurking ominously in your mind. The show is quite capably produced by Zero Point Zero Productions, known for making some of the shows for the late Anthony Bourdain. While it may smack a bit of fear mongering, it delivers much information and food for thought.
Whether you partake of these programs, well, that's your call. But either might cause you to remember another of Stephen King's bestsellers. "The Stand" gives us a planet in chaos after a strain of influenza is accidentally released and kills 99% of the world's population. Published in 1978, the novel was made into a 1994 television miniseries starring, among many, Rob Lowe, Molly Ringwald and Gary Sinise.
More than 19 million people watched each episode of the four-part series, and there is another miniseries based on the book in the works, set to premiere later this year. Maybe you'll watch it, adhering to something Eleanor Roosevelt once said, "Do one thing every day that scares you," having no idea that television would make that so, so easy.

Doctors see spike in flu shot requests [Corrected 02/05/2020]

CORRECTION: This story contains corrected material, published Feb. 5, 2020.
With only seven confirmed cases of respiratory coronavirus in the U.S., Chicago-area health officials joined other experts this week in warning people they should be much more concerned about the flu than the new virus. 
At least 15 million people in the U.S. have contracted flu illnesses so far this season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
More than 180,000 people have been hospitalized, and more than 8,000 have died so far.
In Illinois alone, more than 1,300 lab tests have come back positive for influenza since the start of the season, and more than 400 patients have been admitted to intensive care units as of Jan. 25.
Earlier this month, a Chicago child died from the flu. This was the first case of pediatric flu death in Illinois for the season.
"Coronavirus is something very serious, but in this country, the flu is much more deadly," said Dr. Sindhu Kurian Aderson, of Northwestern Medicine.
Since the first confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S., including one in Illinois, some area doctors say they have seen a huge uptick in the number of patients asking for flu shots.
Dr. Michael Fitzgerald, of DuPage Medical Group (the name of the physician group as published has been corrected in this text), says the coronavirus has brought greater awareness to the dangers of the flu. Now, he's seeing people go out of their way to come into his office for a flu shot.
The flu shot will not protect you from coronavirus, but there are other precautions you can take to help prevent against any sort of respiratory virus.
Doctors have simple suggestions, such as washing your hands, wiping down surfaces someone has touched and covering your mouth when you cough.
Flu season begins in the fall, but doctors say it is not too late to get your flu shot. The vaccine is especially important for young children and the elderly. The CDC also recommends children under age 2 and adults over 65 get the pneumococcal vaccination.
Over the past couple of weeks, Aderson has seen lots of people come to her office concerned about the coronavirus: patients who have been traveling around China or even just traveling through O'Hare's international terminal.
She works to reassure them unless they have been in Wuhan, their risk remains low, and the chances of getting the flu are much higher.

State universities halting travel plans, programs in China

As the global outbreak of coronavirus grows, Illinois universities have gone from urging caution to shut-down mode. 
Some schools have extensive ties to China, connections that go beyond recruiting thousands of Chinese students to local campuses each year. Some operate satellite campuses and centers in the country, and sponsor multiple travel abroad trips each year.
Much of that activity now is halting in an effort to protect students and staff, both here and in China. Here's a closer look. 
University of Chicago
The Hyde Park-based institution has closed its Center in Beijing and Yuen Campus in Hong Kong at least through Feb. 17, according to a note this week from Provost Daniel Diermeier. A university spokesperson was not immediately available to provide more details about how many people are affected by those closures.
University leaders will reassess whether to relaunch programming depending on how the situation develops, Diermeier said.
Meanwhile, university leaders are strongly discouraging any travel to mainland China and Hong Kong.
"Because of quarantine measures that are taking effect in China and the U.S., the University may not be able to effectively assist travelers attempting to return from China," Diermeier said.
U. of C. officials continue to urge students here to contact the campus health center if they are sick or have questions and concerns, according to a note sent to the campus last week.
Any patient who presents with respiratory symptoms and a fever will be asked if they've traveled to the Wuhan area within the past few weeks or have been in close contact with someone known or suspected to have been sickened by coronavirus.
Patients who answer yes will be given a face mask and moved into an isolation room, Dr. Emily Landon wrote in a Q-and-A for UChicago Medicine. The isolation room is designed to keep airborne germs inside. Then patients will be tested for the virus.
Results take about four days, and patients will need to remain isolated until they are cleared by physicians, Landon said. 
Northwestern University
All university-sponsored travel to China is prohibited for undergraduate and graduate students, officials said Friday. Planned trips to China during spring break will be moved to other locations.
Spokesman Bob Rowley said since Northwestern is on the quarter system, winter is not a peak time for travel and study abroad to China for its students. Rowley said no undergraduates currently are enrolled in China-based programs. Only one graduate student is registered to conduct research in China, and that person has relocated to Hong Kong.
"We are lucky not to have to be withdrawing students from China at this time because of this situation," Rowley said.
Beyond that, Rowley said, Northwestern leaders are trying to reach out to its Chinese students on campus to offer support for those who have family back home in China affected by the outbreak.
"We are particularly concerned about our Chinese students and sent a message to them in Mandarin yesterday to let them know that like all of our students, their safety and security is of the utmost importance to the University," he said. "Our first priority is trying to ensure the safety and security of all our students, especially those at risk of contracting the virus, but that also means ensuring the safety and well-being of students from China here who are worried about their families and friends back home and need our support. We want our community members to feel supported and not stigmatized." 
University of Illinois
All academic programs to China are suspended for the spring 2020 semester, Provost Andreas C. Cangellaris announced in a campus email Thursday. Students will not be allowed to travel to China while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisories are in effect, Cangellaris said.
"This decision will affect only a very small number of students studying with partner universities in China," Cangellaris wrote. "The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is in contact with those students and will work with them to adjust their academic plans for the semester."
Faculty and staff are not banned from traveling, but university officials are urging them to carefully consider the federal advisories before traveling.
"The concern is the spread of the coronavirus, as well as logistic difficulties experienced as China implements containment measures," Cangellaris said.
U. of I. has one of the largest population of Chinese students in the U.S., with about 5,900 students enrolled as of this fall.
Once the virus was linked to Wuhan, university health officials worked to identify and contact those students with ties to the area. Dr. Bob Parker, director of the McKinley Health Center, contacted each student individually -- about 150 total -- to inform them about symptoms linked to the virus and urge them to visit the health center if they were feeling ill.
Many of them had not traveled home for winter break and thus were not at higher risk of contracting the virus. For those who did travel, many have chosen on their own to wear surgical masks, self-quarantine and carefully monitor their health, Parker said.
Thus far, no students with ties to Wuhan have shown signs of sickness.
One person has been evaluated at the health center for possible symptoms, but physicians determined that person did not have the illness, Parker said.

Growing concerns about virus overshadow strong earnings

U.S. equities posted their biggest weekly decline since August as growing concerns about the spread of the deadly coronavirus outweighed blowout earnings reports from some of the biggest technology companies.
The S-P 500 Index sank 2.1 percent, extending the drop from its Jan. 17 record to 3.1 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average retreated 2.5 percent, with 24 of its 30 members ending the week lower. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.8 percent.
This week's drop came as the number of cases of the coronavirus that originated in China soared. Investors have grown increasingly worried that the spread of the illness will crimp global economic growth. Warwick McKibbin, a professor of economics at the Australian National University in Canberra, said the global cost could be three or four times that of the 2003 SARS outbreak that sapped the world's economy by $40 billion. That damped the enthusiasm behind strong quarterly earnings results from companies including Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. (Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon, also owns The Washington Post.)
Nine of the main 11 S-P 500 industry groups fell for the week. Energy stocks led the decline, sinking 5.7 percent. 
The U.S. Treasury will sell 13-week bills and 26-week bills on Tuesday. It will also sell four-week bills and eight-week bills on Thursday.

The rapidly spreading virus has closed schools in Knoxville, Tenn., cut blood donations to dangerous levels in Cleveland and prompted limits on hospital visitors in Wilson, N.C. More ominously, it has infected as many as 26-million people in the United States in just four months, killing up to 25,000 so far.
In other words, a difficult but not extraordinary flu season in the United States, the kind most people shrug off each winter or handle with rest, fluids and pain relievers if they contract the illness. 
But this year, a new coronavirus from China has focused attention on diseases that can sweep through an entire population, rattling the public despite the current magnitude of the threat. Clearly, the flu poses the bigger and more pressing peril; a handful of cases of the new respiratory illness have been reported in the United States, none of them fatal or apparently even life-threatening.
'Anything that we don't feel we have sufficient information about feels like a threat,' said Lynn Bufka, senior director of practice research and policy at the American Psychological Association and an expert on anxiety. 'The flu doesn't feel novel. Most people's experience with the flu is they've had it, they've recovered, it's not a big deal " despite the fact that thousands of people die every year.'
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 8.6-million to 12-million people have visited health-care providers complaining of influenza-like symptoms, such as fever, coughing, sneezing and aches since the flu season began Oct.-1. As many as 310,000 have been hospitalized, and 68-children have died.
On the CDC's map of flu activity, most of the nation is a deep red, indicating the highest level of 'influenza-like illness' activity.
The entire school district serving Knoxville and Knox County, Tenn., which has 57,800 students, shut down this past week because of flu circulating among students and staff. In Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which includes Cleveland, 218-people have died and 2,500 have shown up in emergency rooms in the city alone, said Merle Gordon, director of the city's Department of Public Health. In Arkansas, nine school districts are closed, 33 people have died and hospitalizations have increased sharply in the past two weeks.
'We're being hit right now, a lot of communities at the same time,' said Jennifer Dillaha, medical director for immunizations and outbreak response for the Arkansas Department of Health.
More than 173-million doses of flu vaccine have been administered to date, much less than needed to cover the nation. During the 2018-2019 flu season, the latest with complete data available, just 45.3-percent of adults and 62.6-percent of children received flu shots, according to the CDC.
Two types of flu are circulating, increasing risk. They seem to be producing fewer fatalities among older people, who typically comprise most of the deaths during flu season, but they are hitting children hard. The current season does not appear to be as severe as 2017-2018, when as many as 95,000 people died, according to CDC estimates.
But no amount of flu can mitigate public fear and interest in the new coronavirus, which is spreading inexorably out of China, where it has killed about 300 people and infected approximately 14,000.
'I would say that there's good interest in both,' Dillaha said. 'I think people are a little bit panicked about coronavirus and want to know what steps to take, thinking that it's circulating in the state.' So far, it isn't, she said.
Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the government task force coordinating the response to the coronavirus, said he is often asked why the government is focusing on coronavirus when so many are dying of seasonal influenza.
'The reason is, despite the morbidity and mortality with influenza, there's a certainty of seasonal flu. I can tell you as we get into March and April, the cases are going to go down.'
Until officials can offer that kind of certainty about the coronavirus, anxiety levels will not decline, Bufka said. While public health officials are urging handwashing and keeping a distance from obviously ill people, Bufka suggests a different calculation for mental health.
When she counsels anxious clients, they 'try to get a good assessment of what is actually the risk,' she said. 'How likely is it? And try to distinguish between possibility and probability.
'Sure, it's possible there will be more cases in the U.S. It's probable there will be more cases in the U.S. But it's not likely to be the person standing next to me in the grocery store.'

TOKYO " Borders are closing, and flights are being canceled as a coronavirus spreads rapidly in China and continues to appear in new countries around the world. 
China reported approximately 14,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus on Sunday, including 10 on the self-governing island of Taiwan, with about 300 dead.
Businesses and the economy have ground to a halt in China, as hundreds of millions of people hunker down in their homes. The hard-hit central province of Hubei is desperately short of medical supplies, and hospitals are overwhelmed.
As concern and anger mounts, Chinese President Xi Jinping has kept a low profile.
The Philippines on Sunday reported the first death of a coronavirus patient outside of China " a 44-year-old man who died Saturday. The man and a previously diagnosed patient in the Philippines were 'close contacts,' according to the World Health Organization's Philippines branch.
The man who died was a resident of Wuhan, the Chinese city of 11 million people where the outbreak began, officials said. He had a fever, cough and sore throat before he was admitted to a hospital.
An eighth U.S. case was confirmed Saturday " a man in Boston who recently traveled to Wuhan, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. 
More than 130 cases have been confirmed outside of China and Taiwan in more than 20 countries, the World Health Organization reported Saturday.
A day after the United States on Friday imposed unprecedented restrictions on travel to and from China, the U.S. Department of Defense said it would provide housing support for 1,000 people who might need to be quarantined when they arrive from overseas. Military installations in Colorado, California and Texas were chosen to potentially provide housing, a Pentagon spokesman said.
The White House declared a 'public health emergency' Friday and said the United States will deny entry to travelers who have recently visited China " apart from permanent residents and relatives of U.S. citizens " and will impose a 14-day quarantine on returning American citizens.
The State Department told Americans not to travel to China, and dozens of countries followed suit. Australia imposed similar restrictions, while Russia said its armed forces would begin evacuating citizens over the weekend.
Japan has imposed less stringent but nevertheless remarkable measures, barring any foreigners who had visited Wuhan in the past two weeks and any Chinese person whose passport was issued by the provincial government of Hubei. Concerns were also mounting in Japan that the virus could disrupt the Summer Olympics set to take place in Tokyo in July and August. 
In Hong Kong, however, the government hasn't closed its border or halted transport links with mainland China " one of the only territories bordering China that has not taken such a step. On Saturday, a pro-democracy union representing thousands of medical workers in Hong Kong voted overwhelmingly in favor of a strike starting Monday, hoping to pressure the Hong Kong government to completely close the border with mainland China. More than 3,100 members voted in favor of the strike, and only 10 voted against.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un " in a rare move for a country that has generally been on the receiving end of foreign aid " on Saturday sent a consolation letter to Xi in support of the country's fight against the coronavirus outbreak. 
The official Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, said Kim conveyed in the letter sincere wishes to 'share the suffering and trial of the fraternal Chinese people' and had sent aid to China. The isolationist country has also sealed its border with China as scores of virus cases have been confirmed in provinces along the Sino-North Korea border.
A growing list of airlines have canceled flights to China, while the union representing flight attendants in the United States asked the Trump administration to halt all flights to China. Nearly 10,000 flights have been canceled since the start of the outbreak, travel data analytics firm Cirium said. 
But as governments tried to keep the virus out, it continued to spread around the globe, with more than a dozen cases each in Thailand, Singapore, Japan and South Korea, as well as countries from Finland to Australia. The United Kingdom confirmed two cases Saturday.
The spread around China is also a major concern, experts said, with more than 170 cases in Shanghai and nearly 160 in Beijing. And recent analyses suggest that Chinese officials could have controlled the virus sooner if they had been more transparent about the potential severity of the outbreak.
In a study published by the Lancet medical journal Friday, three experts from the University of Hong Kong warned that the epidemic may already be 'growing exponentially' in cities around China with a time lag behind the Wuhan outbreak of one to two weeks.
'Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicenters, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately,' the study warned.
'Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of pre symptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.'
The Chinese government effectively closed down the entire province of Hubei on Jan. 23, but not before an estimated 5 million people had left Wuhan, the provincial capital. Evidence that people who have caught the virus may be infectious before symptoms are obvious has added to concerns.
Meanwhile, the pain for the Chinese economy is mounting, with Beijing, Shanghai and many other provinces telling nonessential businesses to remain closed until Feb. 9.
Even if the outbreak is quickly contained, economic growth 'will slow sharply in early 2020,' the PNC Financial Services Group wrote in a report. 'The crisis will most directly hit China's economy by reducing discretionary consumer spending, and secondarily through government restrictions on economic activity.' 
PNC predicts a sharp recovery in the economy if the government gets the crisis under control in the second quarter and unleashes a new round of stimulus spending. But Bill Bishop, a longtime observer of China, warned that there is a lot more debt in the Chinese economy than in 2002, when it was hit by an outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, but bounced back.
'The financial system is likely to come under extreme pressure in the coming weeks and if the Party cannot get the outbreak under control and restore confidence quickly there is a small but greater than zero chance we could see an economic heart attack alongside this virus,' Bishop warned in his Sinocism newsletter.
Apple announced Saturday it would close all of its stores, offices and contact centers in mainland China until at least Feb. 9, 'based on the latest advice from leading health experts.' 
In Hubei, the information that is trickling out suggests the crisis remained extremely severe, with patients being turned away from hospitals because of a shortage of beds or staying home and avoiding hospitals even when they do fall sick.
'The majority of people are now confined to their homes,' citizen journalist Chen Qiushi said in a video posted on YouTube. 'If there's no transportation, how are you going to get to the hospital? And when you get there, you don't get admitted. So what's the point of going to the hospital if you can't get diagnosed?'
Other Wuhan residents said the same thing: that people were reluctant to go to hospitals even if they fall sick because they felt the chances of treatment were low and the risk of contracting the virus was high.
Chinese authorities are racing to build two hospitals on the outskirts of Wuhan, which were expected to open within the next week and provide an additional 2,500 beds. Other cities around China, including Beijing, were following suit.
But the shortage of medical supplies in Hubei remains acute, with the city of Erzhou issuing an 'urgent appeal' on its social media account.
'Designated hospitals in our city are in urgent need of medical suits, N95 masks, surgical masks, goggles, protective masks and protective suits,' it wrote. 'Now we appeal to the society and citizens for love donations. Urgent need! Urgent need! Urgent need!'
Xi has been keeping a relatively low profile as anger mounts, Bishop reported in his newsletter, not appearing on the front page of the Thursday, Friday or Saturday People's Daily, nor on the Thursday or Friday CCTV Evening News broadcasts on state China Central Television, apart from an unrelated report.
'Now is not the time for the people's leader to disappear from the view of the people,' Bishop said.

EXCHANGE --- Friday's Markets: Stocks Plunge On Virus Concerns

U.S. stocks capped off a turbulent week with a punishing selloff as the coronavirus outbreak fanned fears about global economic growth.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 600 points Friday -- its steepest one-day loss since August -- while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both fell more than 1.5%. All three indexes suffered their worst January since 2016.
Anxiety swept through the stock, bond and commodities markets on uncertainty about the scope of the economic impact of the coronavirus in China, as airlines suspended flights to and from the country and businesses shut down their operations there.
Oil prices have been hit hard, with U.S. crude at its lowest level since early August. A measure of stock swings dubbed the Cboe Volatility Index recorded its biggest January jump on record, a sign of the jitters percolating in markets.
Investors reached for traditionally safer assets like Treasurys and gold. Demand for Treasurys pushed the yield on the 10-year note to 1.521%, nearing 2016's record low, while gold prices hovered near the highest level in almost seven years.
Investors have soured on the market in recent sessions, a reversal from the first two weeks of the year when they piled into stocks on optimism that global growth could rebound. Unlike corporate earnings or economic data, the long-run impact of the virus is trickier to measure for many investors and analysts, injecting even greater uncertainty into markets.
"It could get worse before it gets better," said Adam Phillips, director of portfolio strategy at wealth-management firm E.P. Wealth Advisors. "We alleviate one area of uncertainty and we get two more in its place."
The blue-chip index dropped 603.41 points, or 2.1%, to 28256.03. The S&P 500 shed 58.14 points, or 1.8%, to 3225.52, capping its worst month since August and erasing its gains for the year. The indexes are down 3.7% and 3.1%, respectively, from their Jan. 17 records.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 148 points, or 1.6%, to 9150.94. The index eked out a 2% gain in January, its fifth consecutive month of wins.
Before the week began, the S&P 500 had been on one of its longest stretches without a gain or loss of more than 1% since 1969. That tranquility was shattered Monday when the index dropped 1.6%. It rebounded 1% Tuesday and made modest moves Wednesday and Thursday before dropping sharply again Friday.
"I think people were lulled to sleep," said R.J. Grant, director of equity trading at KBW. "It does not take much to throw things off kilter."
The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the coronavirus -- which has now sickened more than 9,500 people and killed over 200 -- a public-health emergency of international concern.
The potential effects of the virus darkened the outlook at a time when many investors had been encouraged by progress on trade, along with three interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
In one sign of the growth worries, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged back below the yield of the three-month bill this past week. The phenomenon, known as a yield-curve inversion, is often interpreted as a warning sign about a recession ahead.
The outbreak also comes as some big manufacturers have exhibited signs of strain as their earnings results poured in this past week.
Caterpillar, often considered a bellwether for the economy, said Friday it expects demand for its machinery to fall this year, citing global economic uncertainty that crimped sales in the latest quarter. Its shares dropped $4.02, or 3%, to $131.35.
Boeing earlier in the week reported its first annual loss in more than two decades, as one of its aircrafts has been grounded world-wide.
Meanwhile, new data Friday showed that business activity faltered. One measure, the Chicago Business Barometer, fell to its lowest point in about four years, hitting 42.9 and falling well below expectations. Readings under 50 indicate activity is contracting.
Although manufacturing data has disappointed recently, the U.S. consumer continues to spend, restoring some faith in the decadelong economic expansion.
Fresh data released Friday showed household spending rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in December from November. Personal income advanced 0.2% last month.

EXCHANGE --- Biotech Sways on Vaccine Hopes

Biotechnology stocks that surged on hopes for a coronavirus vaccine have since shed their gains, highlighting the risks investors take when they invest in the volatile sector.
Several biotech stocks surged after the companies said more than a week ago that they were developing vaccines against a deadly new strain of coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China. Shares of Novavax Inc. climbed 20% in the sessions following the announcement but pared more than half of those gains by Friday. Shares of Moderna Inc. popped 7.7% Monday before erasing those gains during the next few trading days, while Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. shares shot up 25% Monday before paring most of the advance by the end of the week.
While some buyers may have pegged their hopes on the possibility of a quick vaccine, others were likely making "fast-money trades" off the coronavirus headlines, said Jared Holz, health-care equity strategist at Jefferies. Investors betting that the companies will bring a vaccine to market during the current outbreak will probably be disappointed, he said.
"They buy the hype, sell it when others sort of follow suit, and move on," said Mr. Holz.
These companies face a long, expensive and ultimately uncertain road, industry researchers said. Developing a vaccine and ushering it through the regulatory process can take years, and the outbreak could fizzle out before they can bring it to market.
If the outbreak were to wane, companies would have difficulty running the type of large-scale studies necessary to show a vaccine's efficacy, a problem that emerged during the Zika virus outbreak of 2015. Several companies started vaccine-development programs in response to the epidemic but were unable to show the vaccine's efficacy after the virus faded in 2016.
"It's a lot easier to start a program like this than to finish it," said Mark Feinberg, president and chief executive of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and former chief public-health and science officer at Merck &Co.'s vaccines division.
Inovio, of Plymouth Meeting, Pa., is developing a DNA-based vaccine, and Chief Executive J. Joseph Kim said that human testing could begin by summer. Cambridge, Mass.-based Moderna is working on a vaccine with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. The institute's director has said a vaccine could be ready for an early-stage clinical trial in about three months, though full testing and regulatory approval would take much longer.
Novavax, of Gaithersburg, Md., has said it expects to take roughly three months to develop a vaccine. Gregory Glenn, head of Novavax's research-and-development unit, said in an emailed statement that there are regulatory routes the company could pursue to speed up the process of getting the vaccine to the public.
Although infectious-disease experts praised the companies for taking on the task, they cautioned against putting too much stock into a quick turnaround. There are a lot of unknowns," said Dr. Feinberg.

Treasury yields hit lows on Friday not breached since October as concern mounts that the spread of the coronavirus and accompanying production shutdowns could significantly slow global economic growth through the first half of 2020.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell as traders bought the bonds in a bet that decelerating growth could push the Federal Reserve toward more dovish policy.
"There's been unrelenting buying interest, and it's not time to call for a reversal," said Ben Jeffery, U.S. rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets.
The 10-year yield closed at 1.521%, down from 1.559% Thursday, according to data from Tradeweb. Bond yields fall as prices rise and the 10-year yield has dropped by about 0.40 percentage points in January, the largest one-month decline since August.
The strength in Treasurys reflects changing expectations of how much the Fed will alter interest rates this year, said Scott Buchta, head of fixed income at Brean Capital. "If you look at projections, you're now seeing two rate cuts in 2020, whereas before it was one."
The coronavirus could set off a new round of accommodative moves by central banks if the shutdown of businesses in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland designed to halt the spread of the disease extends through February and possibly into March, Mr. Buchta said.
A spate of negative economic indicators is also bolstering demand for Treasurys. The Chicago Business barometer reported Friday a reading of 42.9 in January, its lowest level in about four years. That followed the Commerce Department report Thursday of unexpectedly low GDP growth in the fourth quarter.
The 10-year Treasury yield closed below the three-month yield on Thursday for the first time since October and did so again on Friday. Investors closely watch the dispersion of Treasury yields, which in some cases are seen as predictors of recessions.
The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, fell Friday to 90.55 from 90.82 on Thursday.

SYDNEY—Australia on Saturday barred foreign nationals who have been in mainland China from entering the country, and ordered its own returning citizens to self-quarantine for 14 days, as the impact of the new coronavirus on world-wide travel spreads.
The U.S. a day earlier imposed entry restrictions on foreign nationals and quarantines on Americans returning from Hubei, the Chinese province at the center of the coronavirus outbreak .
Australia's national airline, Qantas, said earlier Saturday that it would suspend flights to mainland China from Feb. 9., joining major U.S. airlines, including American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc., and
other international carriers , including British Airways and Indonesia's Lion Air. Air New Zealand said Saturday it would suspend its Auckland-Shanghai service from Feb. 9. Pakistan, a close Chinese ally, also banned commercial travel to the mainland on Friday. Italy on Thursday banned flights to mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Australia also raised its travel advice to Australians for all of mainland China to "Do Not Travel." Any foreign nationals who ignore the prohibition and arrive in Australia, and who choose not to immediately return to their port of origin, will be subject to mandatory quarantine, the government said.
"We have not taken any of these decisions lightly," Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Saturday. "The changing epidemiology of the coronavirus in China and the uncertainty that remains around its transmission and virulence, mean the utmost precaution is warranted."
The number of people infected in China approached 12,000 as the death toll from the pneumonia-causing virus rose to 259 as of late Friday, according to China's National Health Commission.
Australia faces an especially awkward balancing act because its economy relies heavily on Chinese demand for education, tourism and its resource exports.
The virus's outbreak coincides with the start of the school year in Australia after a long summer break and the country's schools and universities are scrambling to offer online tuition or deferred start dates to Chinese students.
The prime minister said the prohibition on foreign nationals entering Australia for 14 days from the time they have left or transited through mainland China is a "temporary measure" and will be reviewed in two weeks.
"I want to assure Australians that we are doing everything we can, through these increased actions, to protect Australians and keep them safe from what is an escalating threat," he said in a joint statement with the country's health, home affairs and foreign ministers.
Australia said on Wednesday it would try to pull out citizens stuck in Wuhan, the epicenter of China's coronavirus outbreak, and quarantine them in an immigration detention center on a remote island nearly 1,000 miles off its coast, in one of the most extreme isolation measures undertaken by governments outside China so far to limit the virus' spread. Government officials said Saturday they expect the evacuation process to be set up soon.
Qantas said earlier Saturday that it was suspending flights to the mainland as the virus's spread hampers its ability to staff the Sydney-to-Beijing and Sydney-to-Shanghai routes.
"In selecting a date to suspend services Qantas is working to balance high passenger numbers in both directions—including Australian residents wanting to return home from China—with the various travel restrictions being applied," the airline said in a statement Saturday.
Entry restrictions imposed by countries including Singapore and the U.S. had impacted the movement of crew who work across the Qantas International network, the airline said.
The Australian carrier said its suspension could start earlier, if necessary, and would remain in place until at least March 29. There is no change to its service to Hong Kong.
American halted flights as of Friday. Delta and United said they would stop flights next week, to accommodate customers planning to leave China. The carriers expected to maintain the suspension through early spring.
Qantas had been due to end its Sydney-to-Beijing service on Feb. 23 for commercial reasons.

Mortgage rates continued their slide over concerns about how the worsening coronavirus outbreak will affect the global economy.
According to the latest data released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate average sank to 3.51 percent with an average 0.7 point. (Points are fees paid to a lender equal to 1 percent of the loan amount and are in addition to the interest rate.) It was 3.6 percent a week ago and 4.46 percent a year ago. The 30-year fixed average hasn't been this low since September and is at its second-lowest level in three years.
The 15-year fixed-rate average dropped to 3 percent with an average 0.7 point. It was 3.04 percent a week ago and 3.89 percent a year ago. The five-year adjustable rate average went down to 3.24 percent with an average 0.3 point. It was 3.28 percent a week ago and 3.96 percent a year ago.
'Mortgage rates fell over the past week, heavily influenced by growing global fears surrounding the ongoing coronavirus outbreak that continued to drive market movements this week,' said Matthew Speakman, a Zillow economist. 'While the epidemic's impact on global commerce remains unclear, markets appear to be erring on the side of pessimism, preparing for slowdowns in growth and, potentially, another cut to the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate.' 
The coronavirus outbreak is undoing all the good the December trade deal between Beijing and Washington did. Investors are worried about the damage it will do not only to China's economy but also the global economy. With companies closing down operations across the country, supplies to U.S. businesses could be delayed.
At the moment, the Federal Reserve has decided it will not take any action to stimulate the economy. The Fed left its benchmark rate unchanged after its meeting this week. Although the central bank does not set mortgage rates, its decisions can influence them. The Fed will continue to monitor risks but 'we expect moderate economic growth to continue,' Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell told reporters Wednesday.
The bond market has benefited from all this uncertainty. Investors have been buying up bonds, driving down yields. The yield on the 10-year Treasury tumbled to 1.6 percent on Wednesday, its lowest level since early October.
'The last few days were about the coronavirus, which, as bad headlines often do, pushed money into bonds from stocks,' said Logan Mohtashami, senior loan officer at AMC Lending Group in Irvine, Calif. 'Some of the recent economic data was fine, nothing too dramatic on that front. The Fed isn't going to move this year, so don't worry about Fed rate hikes. If anything, you're more likely to see a [rate] cut than a hike. What the bond market is telling you is correct: Even with the stock market doing well, there is no recession coming but there is no higher rate of growth, either " just yet. Watch carefully for any bad headlines from the coronavirus, this can spark an even bigger rally in bonds.' 
The Commerce Department released its gross domestic product data on Thursday, which showed the U.S. economy grew 2.3 percent last year, at a solid but slower pace than in 2018 when it grew 2.9 percent.
Bankrate.com, which puts out a weekly mortgage rate trend index, found half the experts it surveyed say rates will go down in the coming week. Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economics, is one who predicts rates will move lower.
'There's some uncertainty about 2020 setting in,' Naroff said.
Meanwhile, mortgage applications picked up again fueled by lower rates. According to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the market composite index " a measure of total loan application volume " increased 7.2 percent last week. The refinance index jumped 8 percent, while the purchase index rose 5 percent.
The refinance share of mortgage activity accounted for 60.4 percent of applications.
'This year's lower mortgage rates continue to encourage borrowers to act,' said Bob Broeksmit, MBA president and CEO. 'Mortgage applications jumped 7 percent last week, with both refinances and purchase activity showing strong weekly and annual gains. Lenders in most of the country are reporting that demand has been robust for all of January, as prospective buyers see these low rates and look to get a jump-start on their home search before spring.'

Treasury Bond Yields Fall to Three-Month Low; Potential global slowdown stokes rate-cut expectations

Treasury bond yields hit lows on Friday not breached since October as concern mounts that the spread of the coronavirus and accompanying production shutdowns could significantly slow global economic growth through the first half of 2020.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell as traders bought the bonds in a bet that decelerating economic growth could push the Federal Reserve toward more dovish policy.
"There's been unrelenting buying interest, and it's not time to call for a reversal," said Ben Jeffery, U.S. rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets. "There's reason to believe the rally will extend."
The 10-year yield on the 10-year note closed at 1.521% Friday, down from 1.559% Thursday, according to data from Tradeweb. Bond yields fall as prices rise and the 10-year yield has dropped by about 0.40 percentage points in January, the largest one-month decline since August, when rising trade tension between the U.S. and China sparked selling across stock markets.
Sharp declines in Treasury yields signal expectations of slowed economic activity, often tamping down equity-market sentiment. U.S. stocks rose through most of January despite the Treasury rally, but the equity markets began to show signs of cracking this week and the S&P 500 fell 1.8% Friday.
The strength in Treasurys reflects changing expectations of how much the Fed will alter interest rates by this year, said Scott Buchta, head of fixed income at Brean Capital. "If you look at projections now, you're now seeing two rate cuts in 2020, whereas before it was one."
The coronavirus could set off a new round of accommodative moves by central banks around the globe if the shutdown of businesses in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland designed to halt the spread of the disease extends through February and possibly into March, Mr. Buchta said.
A spate of negative economic indicators in the U.S. is also bolstering demand for Treasurys. The Chicago Business barometer reported Friday a reading of 42.9 in January, its lowest level in about four years. That followed the U.S.Commerce Department report Thursday of unexpectedly low GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Underscoring investors' growth concerns, tThe 10-year Treasury yield on the 10-year Treasury note closed below the three-month yield on the three-month Treasury bill on Thursday for the first time since October and did so again on Friday.
Investors closely watch the dispersion of Treasury yields, which in some cases are seen as predictors of recessions. because recessions have often followed times when long-term yields have dropped below short-term yields, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve.
The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, fell Friday to 90.55 from 90.82 on Thursday.

United Parcel Service Inc.'s close work with Amazon.com Inc. is paying off for the package carrier. The package carrier's shipping volume and operating profit jumped sharply in the fourth quarter, the WSJ's Paul Ziobro reports, as UPS gets cozier than ever with the largest online retailer in the U.S. while rival FedEx Corp. focuses on retailers competing with the e-commerce behemoth. UPS Chief Executive David Abney says Amazon now makes up 11.6% of the company's annual revenue, but that other major retailers all are shipping more with the carrier. The company's pricier air express services grew at a double-digit pace during 2019, including a 25.9% year-over-year gain in next-day air shipments in the fourth quarter. FedEx's overnight air shipments have declined in three of the past four quarters and SJ Consulting says UPS now holds a bigger share of the next-day market than its Memphis-based rival.
E-COMMERCE
Amazon is getting its money's worth from its shipping spending. The company's fourth-quarter sales jumped 21% to $87.4 billion and its profit rose 8% to $3.3 billion, the WSJ's Dana Mattioli reports, capping a strong holiday quarter that saw the e-commerce giant outpace its retail competitors and helping boost Amazon's valuation in after-hours trading past $1 trillion. The company is paying heavily to deliver those goods, racking up nearly $12.9 billion in world-wide shipping costs in the quarter, 42.5% more than the year before. The spending has soared as Amazon has bulked up its network of warehouses and delivery drivers—world-wide shipping costs have more than doubled in three years. But third-party sales are growing at double the rate of Amazon's own online sales, bringing better margins since the company doesn't necessarily handle the goods. And Amazon says the costs for serving its one-day Prime program also are stabilizing.
SUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES
An online fashion startup hopes to make e-commerce smarter by building reverse logistics into the business model right up front. Flip Fit says it will ship customers clothes that they haven't paid for and then use a social network to help them decide what to keep and what to send back. The WSJ's Angus Loten writes the company uses artificial intelligence to push brands, styles and sizes to customers that they are likely to buy . Flip Fit also uses the data from customers to manage its supply chain through an Inglewood, Calif., warehouse, where it ships items from sellers and then handles returns that it hopes to turn around and sell to other users. Online fashion sales are growing rapidly, but the high costs of handling returns has hampered profitability in the sector. Flip Fit's leaders think building returns into the company's business model will give it an edge.

China Fears Spur Emerging-Markets Retreat

The fallout from the deadly coronavirus is battering emerging markets, a sign of skepticism that the world economy can easily bounce back from its worst year in a decade.
After weeks of hoping that a trade detente would buoy the global economy, investors have retreated from wagers on commodities and emerging markets dependent on Chinese consumption. In the past two weeks, the industrial metal copper has dropped 12% and Brent crude, the global gauge of oil prices, is down almost 10%.
Copper is at its lowest point in nearly five months, while oil has fallen to its lowest level since early October.
Lower materials prices threaten growth in producing nations such as Chile and Brazil, and the currencies of those and other emerging markets have fared poorly to start 2020. If needed, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia are considering deepening output cuts to boost oil prices.
Emerging-market stocks have also taken a beating on fresh growth concerns, upending an advance that began in mid-October. Making matters worse: The dollar has rebounded recently, with traders favoring assets more closely tied to the U.S. economy.
A stronger dollar makes investments denominated in the U.S. currency more expensive to foreign buyers. It also makes it more costly for developing countries to service dollar-denominated debt. The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against 16 other currencies, rose Wednesday to its highest level since early December before edging lower Thursday.
Despite concerns that the volatility hitting emerging markets will spread, U.S. stocks remain near all-time highs. The recent gap in performance is the latest example of low interest rates and sturdy consumer spending pushing major U.S. indexes ahead of the rest of the world.
It also underscores the risk of investors piling into countries that have attractive long-term growth prospects, only for them to quickly change direction when sentiment shifts.
"The market doesn't really believe in a global-growth story anymore -- it believes in the central-bank prop-up," said Christopher Stanton, chief investment officer of Sunrise Capital Partners. Mr. Stanton said he hasn't held positions in emerging markets in the past few years given trade concerns and questions about Chinese growth.
Following a 1% rebound Tuesday and modest moves the past two days, the S&P 500 is up 22% in the past year and has marched steadily higher for most of that stretch. By contrast, an index tracking emerging-markets stocks is up only about 3.5% during that span.
Fears of an international slowdown have driven big swings in emerging markets in the past few years, in large part because of their reliance on Chinese consumption. That demand for a range of products and raw materials is now at least temporarily expected to soften with the Chinese government trying to contain the pneumonia-causing coronavirus.
In a sign of how quickly investors' optimism about global growth has faded, copper logged its worst 11-day stretch since October 2011 in the period ended Thursday. A chunk of the declines for the metal, which is vital to manufacturing and construction, came after the number of those infected and killed by coronavirus soared over the weekend.
"The number really shocked people," said Lucy Qiu, emerging-markets strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management. "There's a big fear factor."
The firm is still maintaining a larger position in emerging-market stocks than the benchmark it tracks, wagering that the hit to economic growth in Asia will prove short-lived.
The latest volatility comes after investors had favored emerging markets for weeks, leaving them vulnerable to a reversal, analysts say.
Money had flowed into emerging-market stock funds in 13 consecutive weeks through Jan. 22; billions of dollars also went into funds tracking emerging-market debt, according to figures from EPFR Global.
At the same time, speculative investors had ramped up bets on gains in copper and oil. They recently pushed net bets on higher prices of Brent crude to their highest level since October 2018.
Such crowding worries traders. When sentiment shifts suddenly, the market's swings can get magnified as investors try to limit their losses by changing their positions at the same time.
"There was this consensus trade that everything was fine, that everything was solved," said Marwan Younes, chief investment officer of macro-focused hedge fund Massar Capital Management. "Positioning was excessive."
Mr. Younes said his firm was pessimistic about industrial metals earlier in the month and expects more volatility as traders weigh signals about the Democratic primaries and U.S. presidential election.
The sudden reversal in raw materials is also a setback for U.S. producers. Shares of copper miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc. are down 14% this month alone. Exxon Mobil Corp. shares earlier this week tumbled to their lowest level since 2010 ahead of the company's Friday earnings report.
Their slides come after a run-up in the riskiest parts of the market had fueled worries that the rally had gone too far. The coronavirus was the trigger for a reversal, but some investors had been calling for the advance to pause for weeks.
"You saw how fast and how quickly they all ran," said Megan Horneman, director of portfolio strategy at Verdence Capital Advisors. "It didn't really need to take much in order to spook the market."

Commodities including crude oil and copper fell Thursday, extending their recent slide on concerns that the worsening coronavirus outbreak would pare Chinese demand for raw materials.
Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, dropped 2.6% to as low as $57.34 a barrel, the lowest level in over a year. The futures prices have tumbled 17% since their recent high on Jan. 6, a decline exacerbated by government data released Wednesday showing that U.S. inventories of crude oil unexpectedly increased by 3.5 million barrels last week.
Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, dropped 2.5% to 58.29 a barrel, closing at its lowest level since Oct. 8. The futures prices have tumbled 15% since their recent high on Jan. 6, a decline exacerbated by government data released Wednesday showing that U.S. inventories of crude oil unexpectedly increased by 3.5 million barrels last week.
U.S. crude futures slid 2.2% to $52.14 a barrel, ending the day at their lowest level since early August.
In industrial metals, front-month copper futures slipped 1.2% to $2.5235 a pound on the New York Mercantile Exchange, dropping for the 11th consecutive session. Copper prices have fallen 12% since their recent peak on Jan. 14, with the metal at its lowest price since early September.
The coronavirus outbreak has had an immediate impact on jet-fuel consumption, as Beijing restricted travel and airlines including British Airways and Indonesia's Lion Air halted all flights to mainland China. American Airlines said Wednesday it would suspend flights to Shanghai and Beijing from Los Angeles.
Factories outside of Wuhan -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- have pushed back plans to reopen after the Lunar New Year holiday to Feb. 10 from the end of January, amid Chinese authorities' efforts to limit mass migration. Efforts by Beijing to control the outbreak have rattled investors and traders, who expected shrinking inventories of copper and oil, coupled with an acceleration in the world economy, to lift commodity prices in 2020.
In the copper market, traders worry that the virus will lead to a downturn in construction and manufacturing activity in China, lowering consumption of base metals. The country accounts for around half of global copper demand.
"In terms of actual physical demand there's not much actual effect at the moment, but if this were to continue for several months it would have a very big impact on global copper demand," said Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics. "The market is pricing in the risk of a prolonged downturn in Chinese demand."
The drop in commodity prices has hurt shares in companies that produce oil and mine copper. Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. have fallen 7.2% this month, while Chevron Corp. has declined 7.6% and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. is down 14%.
Shipments of commodities into China typically slow down during the Lunar New Year period, but traders said there could be evidence of greater disruption when the holiday ends next week. Problems could arise if trucks that transport raw materials inside the country face travel restrictions, leading to bottlenecks at ports.
Some analysts think metal prices have fallen too far and are likely to recover quickly if the virus is brought under control.

Commerce secretary says fallout 'will help' bring jobs to U.S. as supply-chain firms depart from virus hot spots

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the Chinese coronavirus " which has killed 171 in China and infected more than 8,100 people " could bring jobs to the United States because companies will be moving operations away from affected areas.
During an appearance Thursday morning on Fox Business, Ross said that he didn't 'want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease,' and expressed sympathy for the victims. But he said the pneumonia-like virus would be a consideration for American businesses that are scrambling to determine how the outbreak will affect their supply chains. He pointed to the 2003 SARS epidemic, the 'African swine virus' and now coronavirus as 'another risk factor that people need to take into account.'
'I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America, some to [the] U.S., probably some to Mexico as well,' Ross said. He then said Apple was 'talking about figuring out how to replace some of the Chinese production.' Apple had plans to assemble some phones and computers outside China before the coronavirus outbreak.
'I think there's a confluence of factors that will make it very, very likely more reshoring to the U.S. and some reshoring to Mexico,' Ross said.
The White House has been pressuring companies in China to move operations to the United States. President Trump recently signed a partial trade deal with China meant to create new incentives for U.S. companies.
Public health experts were quick to criticize Ross's comments as inaccurate and dangerous, saying such messaging could suppress reports of new infections. Health officials are up against the spread of false information on social media, from conspiracy theories to deceitful claims of magical cures. 
Georges C. Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said American companies would have more reason to be concerned about gun violence or measles outbreaks stateside 'in terms of actual risk to their health than coronavirus.'
'You have somebody of that stature who makes an irresponsible comment, speaking on matters in which he has no expertise, and there's no scientific or historical evidence to what he's saying,' Benjamin said of Ross.
Sandro Galea, dean of the School of Public Health at Boston University, said infectious diseases 'threaten all of us' and that there's never a positive consequence from an outbreak. Ross's comments 'rest on a misunderstanding of how infectious diseases are transmitted,' Galea said.
There's a 'responsibility that public officials have to communicate in an informed manner that educates the public and moves us towards an understanding of what actually generates help,' Galea said. 'A comment like this achieves the exact opposite purpose.'
White House officials have been careful in how they've talked about the economic implications of the health scare in China, and Trump has gone out of his way to praise Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
Still, Ross has a history of breaking with White House's messaging. During the government shutdown last year, when some federal workers were resorting to food banks, Ross suggested they consider taking out loans from credit unions to pay their bills. Ross is a billionaire and longtime friend of Trump's.
Total infections in mainland China have surpassed those of the SARS outbreak, and about 100 cases have been recorded in other parts of the world. Global businesses " from Starbucks to airlines to automakers " are increasingly scaling back or suspending their operations nationwide and, with an official lockdown affecting more than 50-million people, consumer spending has plunged.
Global markets fell sharply Thursday. China's markets remain closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slumped more than 2.5 percent, and Japan's Nikkei declined 1.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 150 points at the opening bell, but clawed back more than 100 points.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox Business on Thursday that the White House is not expecting coronavirus to deal a blow to the U.S. economy.
'We see no material impact on the economy,' Kudlow said. 'The pandemic is, of course, in China, not the United States.'

Americans stranded in Wuhan await evacuation as U.S. plans extra flights

TOKYO " Doug Perez has a Chinese girlfriend and a Labrador puppy, and he is not leaving the virus-hit city of Wuhan without them.
But other Americans in Wuhan may finally get their chance to leave after the State Department said Thursday that it was arranging more flights to evacuate its citizens trapped in the Chinese city at the epicenter of the deadly coronavirus outbreak.
The extra flights will be provided beginning on or around Feb.-3 and will have capacity 'on a reimbursable basis' for private citizens wishing to leave Wuhan, the State Department said in a message to U.S. citizens in China.
Those traveling on the flights will be subjected to screening, health observations and monitoring, the department said.
The development came after many Americans trapped in Wuhan expressed frustration about being stranded in the city and what they saw as inadequate communication from U.S. diplomatic officials.
'Many Americans do feel kind of abandoned,' Perez said earlier in a Skype interview from his home in the city. 'It's not necessarily how I feel, but the general sentiment among the Americans here is one of frustration and that we've been left behind.'
https://twitter.com/simondenyer/status/1222758193270378498">
The Chinese government imposed a total travel lockdown on Wuhan last week, leaving 9-million people, including thousands of foreigners, trapped in a city where the virus is raging and hospitals are overflowing.
Already, 129 people have died in Wuhan, with 2,261 confirmed cases and thousands more suspected of carrying the virus, official figures show. But experts say the real number could be much higher.
The U.S. government evacuated 195 Americans from Wuhan this week, flying them to a military base in California. Most were State Department officials and their families, although the department said some private citizens were included, with priority given to those at higher risk from coronavirus, including children, the elderly and people with existing health conditions.
But hundreds of Americans remain in Wuhan with little information and a growing sense of unease.
Gavenraj Sodhi, an American expert in robotics and artificial intelligence, said his Chinese wife and their 18-month-old son, Dylan, are trapped in Wuhan with no way out.
Sodhi, who comes from Chicago but now lives in Shanghai, said he took his family to Wuhan to visit his wife's relatives Jan.-14, with no sense of what was already unfolding there " the city government at the time was not acknowledging the outbreak.
He returned to Shanghai the following day by high-speed train.
Since then, he has been trying to get his family out.
But information from the embassy and State Department has been confusing and often contradictory, he said, forcing him to rely on news reports.
He has been told there is no way to bring his wife out and no way for him to go in and rescue their son. There also has been no sense of a real effort being made or of proper planning, he said.
'If they can't get us out of there, at least give an option of how we can get supplies, how water supplies, food supplies are going to be provided,' he said. 'But there's been nothing. Zero.'
One American woman, visiting relatives in Wuhan for the Lunar New Year holiday, said she was shocked by the tepid response from the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan and the Embassy in Beijing.
The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her Chinese relatives, said she contacted the embassy and consulate when Wuhan was placed under a travel lockdown, then followed up with emails and calls when she learned the first evacuation flight had been organized for consular staff. The embassy, she said, at first denied that a flight was being organized, then told her there would be limited capacity for private citizens.
On Thursday evening, she said she had not received an email about the new flights, which she called 'slightly disconcerting.'
'During this whole time, I've had to rely on news outlets first before they send any communication,' she added. 'I hope they have enough capacity this time, as I likely don't qualify as a 'high risk' individual to be given priority.'
Japan has extracted more than 400 of its citizens from Wuhan and is making arrangements for a third charter flight, while South Korea planned to take people out on two charter flights Thursday and two more Friday. Australia, New Zealand, Canada and India are among countries also discussing evacuation flights with Chinese authorities.
Meanwhile, Perez, his girlfriend, her brother and Chubby, the Labrador, are holed up in their two-floor apartment, with a television, iPads 'and lots of things to do.'
He has been watching 'The Sopranos,' reading and learning computer programming. Wearing a face mask and rubber gloves, he takes the dog for a walk on the largely deserted streets, steering clear of the few other people out and about. Even Chubby has a mask, although he does not like wearing it, Perez said.
They venture out occasionally to stock up on supplies at local stores. There are no major food shortages, but the situation has become 'kind of freaky,' he said.
'We went to the grocery store, and they were testing everyone's temperature at the door,' he said. 'There was one guy panicking. He kept on touching his forehead.'
Perez said he kept his distance.
'It was like something out of a sci-fi movie,' he said. 'A masked person, you know, with goggles and everything. They're putting this temperature gun to your head. And you're waiting in line with other people all wearing masks.'
Perez, a 28-year-old English teacher from Marin County in the San Francisco Bay area, says he has lived in Wuhan for two years and likes it there, despite reservations about air pollution and public sanitation. The wages are decent, and the cost of living is lower than in Beijing or Shanghai, he said.
The mood among Chinese people stranded in Wuhan is not good, either. Perez said his girlfriend is in touch with many people on WeChat.
'There's definitely a lot of people who are panicked, scared,' he said. 'Who knows what's going to happen? It's pretty depressing.'
Wuhan's city government, concerned that hospitals and medical staff will be overwhelmed, has told people with mild symptoms to stay home, Perez said, and many people would rather treat themselves than face chaos in the hospitals.
'The general sentiment among the Chinese community here is that it's not safe to go to the hospitals; they're too overwhelmed,' he said. 'They're worried that if you go to the hospital, you might get infected by other patients.'
Wuhan is rushing to build two pop-up hospitals to isolate thousands of infected patients, but officials admit that there are not enough beds to cope with the number of suspected cases.
China initially rejected offers of assistance from international health officials but agreed this week to allow in a mission led by the World Health Organization. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it expected some of its experts to be invited as part of that mission.
'If I could ask for anything " set politics aside,' Perez said. 'Work with the Chinese. Forget about politics. Get our people out.
'And if the U.S. government could donate supplies to China and if China could accept them, that would be amazing,' he said. 'Just give it to Americans who are stuck here, saying, 'Hey, here's a care package of masks, gloves and the like.' That would be amazing.'

Pressure mounts on Trump to launch coordinated response to epidemic

President Trump, a leading critic of the Obama White House's handling of the Ebola outbreak in 2014, is under increasing political pressure to mount a coordinated federal response to the threat of the new strain of coronavirus " amid fears of a global health crisis with economic ramifications in an election year.
The White House has sought to tamp down criticism from Democrats in recent days by projecting an air of confidence and competence, with Trump presiding late Wednesday over an interagency briefing in the Situation Room. He also announced a new task force of senior aides to lead the government's response, including screenings at 20 U.S. airports, the repatriation of U.S. citizens from China and efforts to develop a potential vaccine to treat the novel virus.
The disease, dubbed a 'public health emergency' by the World Health Organization, has left more than 200 dead and infected more than 9,000 people in China and Taiwan, along with about 100 confirmed cases outside that country, including six people in the United States. 
'This is no cause for urgent panic in any way in the United States,' Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary of health, told reporters at the White House on Thursday. 'This is currently under control. But really, this is a dynamic and rapidly changing event, and the news can change at any moment. But the resources are deployed, the government is mobilized and we feel confident " we know the right steps to take to contain it.'
Yet the vast uncertainty over the contagiousness and lethality of the coronavirus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and the complicated geopolitics given Beijing's poor record of transparency in handling infectious diseases, have increased the stakes for the Trump administration. So has the president's interest in an election year of restoring more normal trade relations with China after years of tariff battles.
Democrats, including 2020 presidential candidates Joe Biden, the former vice president, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), have warned that the president's policies have made the United States more vulnerable to an infectious disease crisis.
They pointed to the dismantling of a global health security team in 2018 during a reorganization of the White House's National Security Council. And in an op-ed published in USA Today on Monday, Biden called Trump the 'worst possible leader' to oversee the government's response, citing his call for then-President Barack Obama to implement a travel ban on West African countries during the Ebola crisis even though public health experts opposed such a move. 
'I remember how Trump sought to stoke fear and stigma. . . . He called President Barack Obama a 'dope' and 'incompetent' and railed against the evidence-based response our administration put in place,' Biden wrote.
Trump has been uncharacteristically muted on the coronavirus. On Wednesday, he tweeted out photos of his Situation Room briefing and professed that his administration is working closely with China. 'We have the best experts anywhere in the world, and they are on top of it 24/7!' he wrote.
One senior administration official said Trump has been hesitant to speak out because some aides have cautioned that he could unnecessarily cause public alarm " and assured him that China is working hard to keep the virus under control. But increasingly, there is a feeling among aides that the president must say more, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
Heath and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who is leading the new task force, provided Trump with a briefing on China's response that prompted the president to issue a more positive tweet last week about Beijing's performance than other officials, believed was warranted, the senior aide said. 
This week, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney began holding daily meetings focused on the issue, officials said, and aides have begun discussing how they could safely evacuate people from China, along with where they could be placed in the United States.
Some administration officials and members of Congress have expressed concern over how transparent Beijing has been in accounting for the breadth of the virus and its failure so far to share full data with the United States and other countries.
Meanwhile, some U.S. lawmakers have pressed for a targeted travel ban from China, which Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Okla.), a close White House ally, said in a letter to the administration was 'warranted to protect Americans until we know more about the virus and the outbreak is under control.' 
Trump's 2020 campaign countered Biden's criticism by pointing to remarks he made in April 2009 during an outbreak of swine flu that he would counsel his own family not to ride the subway or airplanes, which a White House spokesman later said might have caused people to be 'unduly alarmed.' 
'This is another attempt by a failing candidate to gain credibility on an issue where he has almost none,' Trump campaign spokeswoman Sarah Matthews said of Biden. 
Experts said the new coronavirus appears to be more contagious but far less deadly than Ebola, which is thought to have infected more than 28,000 people and killed more than 11,000 during the 2014 outbreak. But China already has confirmed more cases of coronavirus than of SARS, a more deadly coronavirus, during an outbreak that spread through Asia in 2002 and 2003. 
As the midterm elections approached in fall 2014, Trump and numerous GOP leaders faulted Obama for his response to Ebola. Obama appointed Ron Klain, who has worked in multiple Democratic administrations in several roles, as the administration's Ebola czar.
All told, four people in the United States were found to have contracted the disease, including a Liberian national who died while visiting Dallas. The other three recovered, and Obama declared a qualified victory in early 2015 during an event at the White House with public health professionals. 
In an essay in the Atlantic on Thursday, Klain said Trump's 2014 criticism amounted to a 'virulent, xenophobic, fearmongering outburst.' He cited a study from the Obama White House's Office of Digital Strategy that concluded Trump's tweets were a driving factor in instilling a sense of unfounded fear over Ebola among the American public. 
Trump 'will have to trust the kind of government experts he has disdained to date, set aside his own terrible instincts, lead from the White House, and work closely with foreign leaders and global institutions " all things he has failed to do in his first 1,200 days in office,' wrote Klain, who is advising Biden's campaign.
Some global health security experts said that a more senior White House official should be in charge of the Trump administration's response given that Azar has little authority over other agencies. Critics pointed to the 2018 restructuring at the NSC that led to the departure of Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, who had overseen a team dedicated to the U.S. response to a deadly pandemic, as weakening the senior-level attention.
'This is much bigger than HHS,' said J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'There's a sluggishness built into the system by the way they have structured themselves.'
But Tim Morrison, who served on the NSC from 2018-2019, said Ziemer's team was merged with another NSC department and experts remain on the White House staff. He cited the administration's handling of an Ebola outbreak in the Congo in 2018 as evidence that the White House remains capable of coordinating an effective response to an international threat. 
White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien and his deputy, Matthew Pottinger, a fluent Mandarin speaker, are also on the president's task force. Vice President Pence has been involved in interagency meetings. 
'I think the administration is actually running a very effective process,' said Morrison, now a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute. 'They don't need an Ebola czar the way the Obama administration needed one. They've got the apparatus in place.' 
On Capitol Hill, lawmakers have been in touch with Azar and other senior administration officials, and Democrats have mostly refrained from overt criticism of Trump, even as they pressed the administration to devote sufficient resources to managing the situation. 
'A global pandemic is like a meteor coming out of the sky,' said a Democratic congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
The White House 'recognizes the risk of the appearance of not being on top of the situation in case it does turn out this is worse or more problematic than it initially appears,' the aide added. 'There's very little political price you pay for overreacting because people will forget. There's a huge potential vulnerability for underreacting.'

U.S. markets see late rally as investors weigh virus fallout

The U.S. stock market staged a late rally Thursday as investors shrugged off some early concerns about risks posed by the corona virus spreading through China, illustrating the volatility caused by uncertainty abroad. The Wall Street rally was a contrast to foreign markets, which largely slumped.
Chinese markets are closed until Monday for the extended Lunar New Year holiday, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index shed more than 2.5-percent, and Japan's Nikkei declined 1.7-percent. European stocks followed suit, with the benchmark Stoxx 600 index down 0.95-percent in midday trading. The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 150-points at the opening bell, clawed back more than 100 points within minutes, then dropped again. It rallied in the afternoon, though, closing the day up 125-points. The Standard - Poor's 500 and Nasdaq indexes both rose roughly 0.3-percent.
Investors and business leaders are still unclear about the scope of the economic impact from the coronavirus, but numerous companies have pulled back or temporarily suspended operations.
The virus, which has infected more than 8,100 and killed 171, according to Chinese officials, has paralyzed the nation's workforce, with at least three provinces barring all nonessential business activity until Feb.-10. In Hubei province, which has seen the most cases, business activity has been suspended until Feb.-14. And as authorities scramble for solutions to contain the spread, global firms with roots in China have been forced to shut their doors or temporarily freeze operations, without any certainty as to how long the disruption will last.
'Companies are taking decisive action over their exposure to China, such as canceling flights, closing stores and shutting factories,' Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, wrote Thursday in a note to investors. 'It is already clear that earnings will be hit as a result of the coronavirus and we still don't know when the health incident will be contained.'
Starbucks this week shuttered more than 2,000 locations " nearly half its stores in the country " and McDonald's, KFC and Apple have also announced closures. Google said it closed its five offices in China, Hong Kong and self-governing Taiwan.
The outbreak is taking a toll on the airline industry, with British Airways and American Airlines reducing direct flights to and from China. Germany's Lufthansa canceled all Chinese flights until Feb.-9, although it said it would continue service to Hong Kong.
Even though U.S. markets closed higher, some companies with economic ties to China slumped. Starbucks shares fell roughly 1-percent.
Passenger air traffic was about 35-percent lower at the SARS outbreak's worst point for airlines in the Asia-Pacific region, according to the International Air Transport Association. And for 2003 as a whole, the association estimated that SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, cost those carriers 8-percent of their revenue, or roughly $6-billion at the time. The airline industry is being watched closely as flight cancellations persist.
On Thursday, the World Health Organization designated the outbreak a global emergency. Such a designation could signal that the worst is yet to come for China and global businesses.
'The virus impact on Chinese industrial production and exports will likely force the PBOC's hand into using the bazooka of stimulus they were saving in case the US-China trade war took a turn for the worse,' Ed Moya, an analyst with Oanda, wrote in a note to investors Thursday, referring to the People's Bank of China. 'Until markets are confident the virus has peaked and the outbreak is finally contained, U.S. stocks will struggle despite strong earnings.'
At a Federal Reserve meeting Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said that the central bank is closely monitoring the situation in China but that it is too early to know how big a bite it will take out of the global economy.
'The situation is really in its early stages, and it is very uncertain about how far it will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be,' Powell said.

Health officials reported the first U.S. case of person-to-person transmission of the new coronavirus Thursday as the World Health Organization set in motion a global effort to fight the outbreak by declaring it a public health emergency.
Late Thursday, the State Department also issued a 'do not travel' advisory for China. That warning level " the department's highest " had previously been in force only for the province where the outbreak began.
State and federal officials said the sixth infected person in the United States is married to the Chicago-area woman who contracted the virus when she traveled to Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. The unidentified man, who is in his 60s, has been isolated in the same suburban hospital as his wife since Tuesday, when he began exhibiting symptoms consistent with the early stages of the virus, including fever, coughing and shortness of breath, officials said.
Officials suspect he picked up the virus in the couple's home while his wife was symptomatic, according to Jennifer Layden, state epidemiologist for the Illinois Department of Public Health. The woman, who was identified last week as the second U.S. case, has been hospitalized since and is doing well, Layden said.
Her husband has not attended mass gatherings, Ngozi Ezike, director of the state health department, said in a news briefing. 'The virus is not spreading widely across the community,' she added.
Officials are tracing the people who came in contact with the new patient but are not recommending any new precautions by others, Ezike said.
Around the globe, however, and particularly in China, the respiratory illness caused by the newly identified virus continued on a widening, destructive path that increased public anxiety. The virus had killed 213 people " all of them in China " and infected more than 9,700 as of Friday.
About 90 cases have been recorded outside China " including the first two in Italy, both Chinese tourists, according to news reports.
Airlines are cutting or completely canceling flights to China, a nation of 1.4-billion people, and some businesses have begun preparing for a possibly extended slowdown in operations and sales there. The union representing 15,000 American Airlines pilots sued the company to halt the carrier's U.S.-China service, citing 'serious, and in many ways still unknown, health threats posed by the coronavirus.'
The WHO criticized such actions, urging countries against imposition of trade or travel barriers. It also called for the world community to combat misinformation about the outbreak and accelerate vaccine development.
The global health agency urged Chinese health authorities to take a range of measures, in addition to the travel restrictions already imposed on 50-million people in central China's Hubei province.
It asked China to collaborate with the WHO and others to conduct investigations; share full data on all of its cases; keep people informed about the evolution of the outbreak and protection measures the government has taken; boost efforts to identify the animal source of the outbreak; and conduct exit screening at international airports and ports so travelers with symptoms can be identified and treated.
The WHO cannot enforce its recommendations, but countries are under political pressure to follow them.
Public health officials and experts have criticized China for not sharing crucial data about patients, including when they became ill. That information is needed to learn more about the evolution of the outbreak, which would help officials control its spread.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus nevertheless praised China's efforts to contain the outbreak.
'Let me be clear: This declaration is not a vote of no confidence in China,' he said. 'On the contrary, WHO continues to have confidence in China's capacity to control the outbreak. The Chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to control the outbreak despite the severe social and economic impact those measures are having on the Chinese people.'
The White House also announced the formation of a task force, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, to coordinate the U.S. response.
As countries began repatriating citizens or planning to do so, the difficult task of balancing personal rights and public protection became more acute. In Southern California, Riverside County health officials issued a 'quarantine order' Thursday that allowed them to hold an individual against the person's will.
The person, who had been flown in from Wuhan a day earlier, had attempted to leave the military base where 195 American evacuees are being temporarily held for monitoring.
'They expressed a desire to leave, they tried to leave,' said Jose Arballo Jr., a spokesman for Riverside County's Department of Public Health. 'But they never got off the grounds of the base.'
In a statement, officials said Cameron Kaiser, the county's public health officer, ordered the person to stay on the base until the individual is cleared by health officials, because of 'the unknown risk to the public should someone leave [the base] without undergoing a full health evaluation.'
'The individual will remain at [the base] until their health status is confirmed,' the statement said. 'All other passengers from the flight also remain at [the base] and continue to be evaluated.'
In Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison's plan to send evacuees from Hubei to Christmas Island, a territory 1,000 miles offshore, drew mixed reaction. There are hundreds of Australian citizens in the Chinese province.
If Australia is able to bring them home, they will be required to stay on the island for two weeks and pay about $677 each for the evacuation, Australian media reported.
In a television interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corp., Daniel Ouyang, an Australian citizen stuck in Wuhan after visiting family, said he is debating whether he should board a flight that will require the stay on Christmas Island.
'What's going to happen to us when we arrive?' he asked. 'What's going to happen to our freedom? What are going to be able to do and not be allowed to do?'
In Chicago, Public Health Commissioner Allison Arwady said the new U.S. patient was placed in isolation Tuesday, the same day he exhibited symptoms. The man, who has underlying health conditions, is in stable condition at a medical center in Hoffman Estates, a suburb of Chicago, where his wife is also hospitalized.
Arwady said the man has 'been extremely helpful' in sharing the details of his recent activities.
'He has not taken the 'L.' He has not attended any large gatherings,' she said, noting that he has used his own car, not the city's elevated-train system, to get around. 'This news does not change the risk to the general public. It is not a local emergency.'
Officials warned a jittery public, however, to expect additional cases and perhaps more person-to-person transmissions of the virus. That has now occurred in the United States, Germany, Japan, Vietnam, China and Taiwan.
'Moving forward, we can expect to see more cases, and more cases means the potential for more person-to-person spread,' said Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Nonetheless, the overall risk to people in the United States is still considered quite low, officials said. They advised U.S. residents to take the kinds of precautions they would to guard against seasonal flu " which already has killed at least 8,200 people in late 2019 and early 2020 " including frequent hand-washing and staying home when they are sick.
There is no need for face masks in the United States, Messonnier said.
Yet at Mr. Ace, a hardware store in the Hoffman Estates neighborhood where the Chicago couple are hospitalized, sales of face masks have spiked over the past week.
'We can barely keep them on the shelves,' said owner Mike Patel. So far, the store has sold about 120 masks and has restocked them every three days.
'We keep getting them, and people are still buying them,' he said.

Commodities Slump on Fears Chinese Demand Will Drop; Copper prices have fallen 12% since their recent peak and brent crude dropped to its lowest level in over a year

Commodities including crude oil and copper fell Thursday, extending their recent slide on concerns that the worsening coronavirus outbreak would pare Chinese demand for raw materials.
Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, dropped 2.5% to $58.29 a barrel, closing at its lowest level since Oct. 8. The futures prices have tumbled 15% since their recent high on Jan. 6, a decline exacerbated by government data released Wednesday showing that U.S. inventories of crude oil unexpectedly increased by 3.5 million barrels last week.
U.S. crude futures slid 2.2% to $52.14 a barrel, ending the day at their lowest level since early August.
In industrial metals, front-month copper futures slipped 1.2% to $2.5235 a pound on the New York Mercantile Exchange, dropping for the 11th consecutive session. Copper prices have fallen 12% since their recent peak on Jan. 14, with the metal at its lowest price since early September.
The coronavirus outbreak has had an immediate impact on jet-fuel consumption, as Beijing restricted travel and airlines including British Airways and Indonesia's Lion Air halted all flights to mainland China . American Airlines said Wednesday it would suspend flights to Shanghai and Beijing from Los Angeles.
Factories outside of Wuhan—the epicenter of the outbreak—have pushed back plans to reopen after the Lunar New Year holiday to Feb. 10 from the end of January, amid Chinese authorities' efforts to limit mass migration. Efforts by Beijing to control the outbreak have rattled investors and traders, who expected shrinking inventories of copper and oil, coupled with an acceleration in the world economy, to lift commodity prices in 2020.
In the copper market, traders worry that the virus will lead to a downturn in construction and manufacturing activity in China, lowering consumption of base metals. The country accounts for around half of global copper demand.
"In terms of actual physical demand there's not much actual effect at the moment, but if this were to continue for several months it would have a very big impact on global copper demand," said Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics. "The market is pricing in the risk of a prolonged downturn in Chinese demand."
The drop in commodity prices has hurt shares in companies that produce oil and mine copper. Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. have fallen 7.2% this month, while Chevron Corp. has declined 7.6% and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. is down 14%.
Shipments of commodities into China typically slow down during the Lunar New Year period, but traders said there could be evidence of greater disruption when the holiday ends next week. Problems could arise if trucks that transport raw materials inside the country face travel restrictions, leading to bottlenecks at ports.
Some analysts think metal prices have fallen too far and are likely to recover quickly if the virus is brought under control.
Supply disruptions in Libya and tensions in the Middle East have prevented oil prices from falling further, Ms. Bain said. Officials in Saudi Arabia said Wednesday that the kingdom's air defense forces last week shot down missiles aimed at Saudi Aramco facilities.
The illness has had a direct impact on demand for jet fuel, justifying the drop in oil prices, according to Michael Haigh, head of commodities research at Société Générale. It is less obvious that coronavirus will lower the amount of copper wire used in Chinese infrastructure projects or properties, he added.

Federal Reserve Holds Benchmark Rate Steady; All 10 members of the central bank's rate-setting panel voted to hold the fed-funds rate in a range between 1.5% and 1.75%

WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged Wednesday and reaffirmed its make-no-moves posture while it gauges how rate cuts last year cushioned the U.S. economy against a spell of weaker global growth.
"We're comfortable with our current policy stance and we think it's appropriate," Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the central bank announced its decision.
But his comments suggested that lingering risks to the global economy and difficulty sustaining inflation at the Fed's 2% target meant that if Fed officials were to change rates, they would be more likely to cut them than to raise them.
Inflation has held below the target since the central bank formally adopted it in 2012, except for 2018, when Fed officials most recently raised interest rates. They reversed course last year and cut rates three times as the global economy slowed and inflation ran below 2%.
"We're not satisfied with inflation running below 2%, particularly at a time such as now where we're a long way into an expansion and a long way into a period of very low unemployment, when in theory where inflation should be moving up," Mr. Powell said at the news conference.
Mr. Powell and his colleagues have been considering changes to their inflation-targeting framework that would seek to stem falling consumer expectations of future inflation. The officials are concerned that low inflation and low nominal interest rates could hinder the Fed's ability to reduce rates to counteract a future recession.
"We have seen this dynamic play out in other economies around the world and we're determined to avoid it here in the United States," he said. Mr. Powell later said the review was designed to address how "ongoing powerful, global disinflationary trends" have hampered central banks around the world.
Mr. Powell's comments on inflation provided "a strong message that they're going to err on the side of providing more accommodation," said Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics. "It's unclear at this point if that means they actually cut interest rates this year, but at a minimum, they're far, far away from considering interest-rate hikes."
The Fed's postmeeting statement Wednesday offered a mixed assessment of the economic outlook. It described consumer spending growth as moderate, a downgrade from "strong" in December, and said business investment had remained weak.
All 10 members of the central bank's rate-setting committee voted to hold the Fed's benchmark federal-funds rate in a range of 1.5% to 1.75%.
To keep the rate trading near the midpoint of that range, they also decided to slightly increase a separate rate, the interest rate paid on bank deposits, or reserves, held at the Fed, to 1.6% from 1.55%.
The technical adjustment amounts to a housekeeping move after the Fed flooded markets with cash in September to prevent money-market volatility from pushing the fed-funds rate out of its range. The Fed had lowered the interest rate on reserves closer to the bottom of the fed-funds range in September as part of those efforts.
Since Fed officials' December meeting, financial markets had been ebullient due to a cease fire in trade hostilities between the U.S. and China, and the resolution of how the U.K. would leave the European Union. Reduced geopolitical uncertainty has been joined by glimmers of firmer global manufacturing activity.
But markets have turned jittery in recent days because of worries that the outbreak of the coronavirus in China could further slow the Chinese economy, with repercussions for global demand.
"There are grounds for what I would call cautious optimism for the global economy," said Mr. Powell. "We are not at all assured of a global rebound but there are signs and reasons to expect it—and then comes the coronavirus."
The Fed became especially sensitive to global developments last year, shelving in January 2019 plans to continue lifting rates before turning toward cutting them in July amid declines in market-based rates and unexpectedly soft inflation readings.
Mr. Powell said it was too soon to say how the virus would affect Chinese, global and U.S. growth. "There will clearly be implications of course in the near term for Chinese output, and I would guess for their close neighbors," he said. "We'll just have to see what the effect is globally."
Speaking more broadly, he said the Chinese economy—the world's second-largest—was very important for the global economy. "When China's economy slows down, we do feel that," he said.

MORENO VALLEY, Calif. -- More than 200 Americans evacuating from the Chinese city at the center of the coronavirus epidemic landed at an Air Force base near this city outside Los Angeles on Wednesday morning, bookending a journey that involved multiple screenings for symptoms of the deadly virus.
Medical officers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention met the plane when it landed at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, Calif.
All of the passengers are being tested twice a day for symptoms of the highly contagious virus and being asked to stay at the base for at least three days, health officials said. Samples have also been taken and sent to a CDC laboratory in Atlanta, the only one in the country that can test for the coronavirus.
After three days, those who want to go home will be allowed to do so if they have tested negative and haven't shown any symptoms. Once home, they will continue to be monitored by local health officials.
Passengers could potentially be allowed to leave before 72 hours are up, if they have tested negative. So far, that hasn't happened, said Dr. Chris Braden, deputy director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases for the CDC.
Although no quarantine is in place, Capt. Nancy Knight, director of the CDC's Division of Global Health Protection, said passengers wouldn't simply be allowed to walk off the base.
Dr. Braden said, "If we think that a person is a danger to the community, we can institute an individual quarantine for that person, and we will."

Businesses Scale Back in China Over Virus

Global firms operating in China are closing stores, scaling back operations and restricting travel as the Chinese government races to control the coronavirus that has now infected more people than severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, did in the country almost two decades ago.
Airlines are halting flights to the country, reporting falling demand as passengers fear contagion and businesses move to protect employees.
British Airways and Indonesia's Lion Air said Wednesday they would stop flying to mainland China, while American Airlines Group Inc. has suspended flights from Los Angeles to Shanghai and Beijing. Delta Air Lines Inc. said it would temporarily halve the number of weekly flights it operates between the U.S. and China to about 20.
In just a few weeks, the fast-spreading virus -- which is believed to have originated at an animal and seafood market in Wuhan heading into the Lunar New Year holiday -- has killed more than 170 people and infected more than 7,700, with most of the cases in China.
The World Health Organization plans to meet Thursday to decide whether to declare the outbreak of coronavirus a public-health emergency of international concern.
Tens of millions of people in China have been affected by government restrictions on movement, and U.S. workers returning from China are being asked by companies to work remotely for weeks at a time as a precaution.
JPMorgan Chase &Co., auto maker Ford Motor Co. and consumer-goods giant Kraft Heinz Co. are among the companies that have introduced employee travel bans to and from China.
"This will help reduce the unnecessary risk of virus exposure or transmission and is the most prudent measure to take while we continue to closely monitor the situation in China," Kraft Heinz spokesman Michael Mullen said.
Google told employees this week it would shut down its offices in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, in a nod to governmental directives to try to reduce the spread of virus. The company has advertising and sales staff in four offices on the mainland.
Some companies are starting to warn the virus will hit financial results. In 2018, U.S. companies sold Chinese consumers and businesses $386 billion worth of goods, according to a spokesman for the US-China Business Council.
The spread of the virus could hamper Tesla Inc.'s efforts to increase production in Shanghai and slightly dent first-quarter earnings, said Zach Kirkhorn, chief financial officer of the electric-car maker, which is betting big on the Chinese market.
Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. warned the outbreak would hurt its 2020 financial performance after it canceled three sailings scheduled for February.
Starbucks Inc. has closed more than half of its roughly 4,300 stores in China -- its second-largest market -- and warned the move would weigh on financial results. The closures could lower profit per share by half a penny and revenue by $25 million each week the stores are closed, according to estimates from analysts at William Blair.
Yum China Holdings Inc., operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell stores in China, and McDonald's Corp. also have closed stores, as have the parent company of retailer H&M and the Ingka Group, which operates IKEA stores. Apple Inc. has reduced store operating hours in China.
Mondelez International Inc., the maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate, expects lower sales as a result of the outbreak. The Lunar New Year season is typically a lucrative time for candy and snack makers in China.
"We expect less buying by the consumer," Chief Executive Dirk Van de Put said. He said two factories near the epicenter of the outbreak will remain shut for another week at the request of local officials.
Other companies closed facilities for the Lunar New Year holiday and are monitoring the outbreak. Spice maker McCormick &Co. shut three plants in China, where it makes products for the market, and Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev SA closed its Wuhan brewery.
Jon Moeller, finance chief for Procter &Gamble Co., said the outbreak could affect consumers well beyond China. "It can also affect consumer confidence in large parts of the market," he said.
The outbreak is taking a toll on global travel and hurting hotel stocks, analysts at BMO Capital Markets said. China represents 6% of rooms for Hilton Worldwide Inc. and 8.5% of rooms for Marriott International Inc.
Walmart Inc. had been asked by the government to keep its stores in China open, a person familiar with the matter said last week. The retail giant had 443 stores in the country as of Jan. 31 of last year, according to a securities filing. A spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
Bernard Arnault, the chief executive and controlling shareholder of Paris-based LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, said he has asked his teams in China about the impact of the outbreak. Chinese shoppers are the luxury industry's most important clientele, representing more than a third of global sales, according to consulting firm Bain &Co.
If the consequences of the outbreak are felt through March, that wouldn't be terrible, said Mr. Arnault, but "if it lasts two years, that would be another story."
The SARS outbreak lasted nine months in 2002 and 2003. The number of SARS infections world-wide -- 8,098 -- for now remains higher than the latest coronavirus total, according to the WHO.

The number of people in China infected by a fast-spreading new coronavirus surpassed that of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, cases as airlines halted flights to the country and governments around the world worked to repatriate their citizens from the city at the center of the outbreak.
Taken together, the airlines' moves serve as a harbinger of more cutbacks to services to the Chinese mainland, as safety concerns rise and demand drops sharply -- triggered by the virus's rapid spread around the globe.
In a matter of weeks, the pathogen has killed at least 170 people and infected more than 7,700 people in China, according to China's National Health Commission. That latter number topped SARS, which also originated in China, killing 349 people and infecting 5,327 on the Chinese mainland during its nine-month outbreak in 2002 and 2003. The number of SARS infections world-wide -- 8,098 -- is still higher than the total for the new coronavirus -- 6,065, according to the World Health Organization.
The WHO said it would decide on Thursday whether to declare the outbreak an international public-health emergency, based on an increasing number of cases and evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China.
Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health-emergencies program, praised China's response to the outbreak on Wednesday. "Myself and the director-general have never seen the scale, commitment of an epidemic response at this level," Dr. Ryan said.
Governments globally were evacuating their citizens from Wuhan, the city in central China where the virus emerged late last year.
Several countries, including Japan and South Korea, are planning evacuations of their citizens.
Meanwhile, new cases continued to emerge around the world.
The United Arab Emirates's Health Ministry said Wednesday that a family of four visiting from Wuhan had contracted the new coronavirus, the Middle Eastern nation's first confirmed cases.
Kazakhstan, which shares a border with China, said Wednesday that it would suspend all transport links to the country in addition to stopping the issuance of entry visas to Chinese citizens over the coronavirus.
Georgia was suspending all direct air traffic with China as a preventive measure, the former Soviet republic's air-traffic authority said.
In Russia, all tour operators have stopped selling tours to China, including charter flights, according to Russia's national tourism agency, Rostourism.
New Zealand followed the U.S. in advising against nonessential travel to China, and Australia urged its citizens to reconsider travel to the country.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday urged residents to return home from the mainland immediately and to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days after.
The Communist Party-run People's Daily, via an official social-media account, asked that passengers who had made any of 116 domestic journeys by public transport -- the post listed specific train, plane and bus numbers -- quarantine themselves at home and report to authorities in their communities.
Passengers from just two of those trips, taken Jan. 6 to Jan. 23, had been found, according to the posting.

Hang Seng Index In Postholiday Drop

Hong Kong-listed stocks dropped sharply on their first trading day after the Lunar New Year break, as investors assessed the spreading Wuhan coronavirus and its impact on global growth.
The benchmark Hang Seng Index dropped 2.8% on Wednesday, catching up with a slide in global markets that took place earlier in the week. Early Thursday, the benchmark was down a further 1.8%.
Markets in mainland China remain closed for the holiday. They are scheduled to reopen next week.
Investors bet against Chinese companies. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks large Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, fell 3.3%.
Exchange-traded funds composed of A-shares listed on the mainland fell even more.
The ChinaAMC CSI 300 Index ETF, which is designed to mimic the performance of the biggest stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen, dropped 5%.
The declines come as the number of confirmed cases and fatalities from the pneumonia-causing coronavirus continues to rise.
"Financial markets are reacting nervously to the spread of the coronavirus, and more and more questions are being asked about the economic consequences," said Charlie Lay, a foreign-exchange strategist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore.
The Hong Kong government unveiled measures to limit travel to and from mainland China to try to contain the outbreak, though it stopped short of shutting the border.
The main concern among global investors is that the virus could turn into a pandemic that cripples transportation, shopping, business meetings and weighs on economic growth.
Luxury retailers, travel companies and casino stocks have been among the hardest hit shares in recent weeks.
On Wednesday, shares of Macau resort and casino operator Sands China Ltd. dropped 5.6%, while Galaxy Entertainment Group fell 5.2%.
Chinese property-developers China Evergrande Group and Sunac China Holdings Ltd. declined 4.2% and 5.2%, respectively.
Meanwhile, stock indexes in South Korea, Australia and Japan rose Wednesday.
The gains came after U.S. stocks rebounded on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 rising 1% after suffering its steepest loss since October on Monday.
The yuan strengthened slightly in offshore trading on Wednesday, then fell back to 6.9659 per U.S. dollar.
Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said part of the concern weighing on markets is the speed at which information travels today.
The global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003, by comparison, took place before the dawn of modern-day social media.
"The echo chamber to amplify market anxiety has never been more powerful," she said.

World News: Mother's Bid to Flee With Daughter --- An American in Wuhan raced to leave the city with her child but was turned back

SHANGHAI -- When Priscilla Dickey learned the U.S. government was planning an evacuation flight out of the Chinese city at the center of the largest quarantine zone in history, she was desperate to get a seat for her 8-year-old daughter, Hermione.
Hermione was with her mother in Wuhan when authorities abruptly blocked transportation in and around the metropolis of 11 million people. The lockdown was China's risky bid to slow the spread of a dangerous coronavirus -- and Hermione had a fever.
The number of people killed or sickened by the virus had jumped. Ms. Dickey, 35 years old, and Hermione's father, James Dickey, who is 43 and lives in a nearby city, were unable to find a clinic equipped to test their daughter for the coronavirus.
A chest scan indicated that she wasn't suffering from pneumonia, Mr. Dickey said. By the weekend, her illness had mostly passed -- but Hermione's parents were determined to get her out.
After The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that the U.S. government was arranging for an evacuation flight for some of the about 1,000 Americans living in and around Wuhan, the Dickeys saw an opportunity.
The couple decided to register their personal information with the State Department. It paid off, and the embassy emailed Ms. Dickey to say she and Hermione had been selected to board a flight. Takeoff was initially expected Sunday, then got pushed back to Tuesday -- first the morning, then at night.
Ms. Dickey packed for a journey to California and then on to Ohio, to unite with her family. It would be her daughter's first trip to the U.S. in five years. Hermione's father lives in Changsha, 250 miles from Wuhan; her passport was at his apartment. In its place they packed a photocopy.
On Jan. 17, life was normal enough for a birthday party for Hermione, with cake and friends. Among the gifts, Hermione was particularly pleased with a blue dress adorned with a bow and a picture of Elsa from "Frozen."
By the end of the following week, Wuhan was locked down and the numbers of deaths and illnesses had climbed.
A U.S.-chartered jetliner, staffed with medical personnel to evacuate staff of the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, their families and a number of other Americans, was the only promise of a way out.
Though Ms. Dickey and Hermione had been selected for seats on the flight, getting to the airport would present another challenge, with roadblocks around the quarantined city and public transport shut down.
They got lucky again, when Jacob Wilson, an American who had decided to stay behind in Wuhan, offered to drive.
Ms. Dickey had arrived four hours early for a flight that was expected to depart around 10 p.m. The U.S. diplomats and other citizens planning to board waited inside an otherwise-deserted international airport.
Around midnight, as they approached the airport's immigration section, they were pulled aside. Immigration officers wanted to see Hermione's passport, not the photocopy.
U.S. diplomats from the evacuated consulate, also planning to board the flight, handled negotiations with the Chinese immigration officers. When Wuhan was sealed off on Jan. 23, the girl's passport was in another province, hundreds of miles away.
At 2 a.m., Chinese immigration officers ruled that the photocopy of Hermione's U.S. passport wasn't adequate.
"I knew it was over," Ms. Dickey said, "when the two consular members came over and they had that look about them, like two doctors going in to tell a patient they had something super bad."
Hermione wouldn't be allowed to board the plane. Around 3 a.m., Ms. Dickey called Mr. Wilson for a ride back into the city.
At China's border-control agency in Wuhan, a man answering phones said he couldn't answer questions and other officials in the service couldn't be reached to comment on Wednesday, amid the Lunar New Year holiday.
Despite her frustration, Ms. Dickey said she understood China's efforts to contain the disease and empathized with the airport staff.
"I do have to give it to the Chinese though. These guys were working at the airport so we could all leave. They were working. It's a holiday. There's a quarantine in place. Everything's shut down. But yet they were there working for us until 3 a.m."
The Dickeys weren't the only American family left behind by the flight. A website called Wuhan Warriors Network went online, pleading for supplies and assistance.

U.S. News: Fed Holds Benchmark Rate Steady, Reaffirms Its Stance

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged and reaffirmed its make-no-moves posture while it gauges how rate cuts last year cushioned the U.S. economy against a spell of weaker global growth.
"We're comfortable with our current policy stance and we think it's appropriate," Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday at a news conference after the central bank announced its decision.
But his comments suggested that lingering risks to the global economy and difficulty sustaining inflation at the Fed's 2% target meant that if Fed officials were to change rates, they would be more likely to cut them than to raise them.
Inflation has held below the target since the central bank formally adopted it in 2012, except for 2018, when Fed officials most recently raised interest rates. They reversed course last year and cut rates three times as the global economy slowed and inflation ran below 2%.
"We're not satisfied with inflation running below 2%, particularly at a time such as now where we're a long way into an expansion and a long way into a period of very low unemployment, when in theory where inflation should be moving up," Mr. Powell said.
Mr. Powell and his colleagues have been considering changes to their inflation-targeting framework that would seek to stem falling consumer expectations of future inflation. The officials are concerned that low inflation and low nominal interest rates could hinder the Fed's ability to reduce rates to counteract a future recession.
"We have seen this dynamic play out in other economies around the world and we're determined to avoid it here in the United States," he said. Mr. Powell later said the review was designed to address how "ongoing powerful, global disinflationary trends" have hampered central banks around the world.
Mr. Powell's comments on inflation provided "a strong message that they're going to err on the side of providing more accommodation," said Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics. "It's unclear at this point if that means they actually cut interest rates this year, but at a minimum, they're far, far away from considering interest-rate hikes."
The Fed's postmeeting statement Wednesday offered a mixed assessment of the economic outlook. It described consumer spending growth as moderate, a downgrade from "strong" in December, and said business investment had remained weak.
All 10 members of the central bank's rate-setting committee voted to hold the Fed's benchmark federal-funds rate in a range of 1.5% to 1.75%.
To keep the rate trading near the midpoint of that range, they also decided to slightly increase a separate rate, the interest rate paid on bank deposits, or reserves, held at the Fed, to 1.6% from 1.55%.
The technical adjustment amounts to a housekeeping move after the Fed flooded markets with cash in September to prevent money-market volatility from pushing the fed-funds rate out of its range. The Fed had lowered the interest rate on reserves closer to the bottom of the fed-funds range in September as part of those efforts.
Since Fed officials' December meeting, financial markets had been ebullient due to a cease fire in trade hostilities between the U.S. and China, and the resolution of how the U.K. would leave the European Union. Reduced geopolitical uncertainty has been joined by glimmers of firmer global manufacturing activity.
But markets have turned jittery in recent days because of worries that the outbreak of the coronavirus in China could further slow the Chinese economy, with repercussions for global demand.
"There are grounds for what I would call cautious optimism for the global economy," Mr. Powell said. "We are not at all assured of a global rebound but there are signs and reasons to expect it -- and then comes the coronavirus."
The Fed became especially sensitive to global developments last year, shelving in January 2019 plans to continue lifting rates before turning toward cutting them in July amid declines in market-based rates and unexpectedly soft inflation readings.
Mr. Powell said it was too soon to say how the virus would affect Chinese, global and U.S. growth. "There will clearly be implications of course in the near term for Chinese output, and I would guess for their close neighbors," he said. "We'll just have to see what the effect is globally."
Speaking more broadly, he said the Chinese economy -- the world's second-largest -- was very important for the global economy. "When China's economy slows down, we do feel that," he said.

Stocks pulled back after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell offered investors a mixed outlook on the economy, deflating the stock market's recovery from an early-week selloff.
The central bank left interest rates unchanged, which initially kept the stock market steady.
Stocks started slipping after Mr. Powell, in his press conference later in the afternoon, said the fast-spreading coronavirus may pose risks to global growth and offered a more tempered outlook on economic growth.
"There are grounds for what I would call cautious optimism for the global economy," said Mr. Powell. "We are not at all assured of a global rebound but there are signs and reasons to expect it -- and then comes the coronavirus."
Mr. Powell added that it is too early to speculate on the macroeconomic implications for China.
Still, major U.S. stock indexes relinquished most of their gains by the end of the session.
The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged ended the day up 11.60 points, or less than 0.1%, to 28734.45, despite advancing more than 200 points earlier in the session.
The S&P 500 fell into negative territory, shedding 2.84 points, or 0.1%, to 3273.40. The Nasdaq Composite rose 5.48 points, or less than 0.1%, to 9275.16.
All three indexes remain down for the week. Most of the losses occurred on Monday, when the Dow fell roughly 454 points on reports that the number of people infected and killed by the coronavirus had jumped over the weekend.
"We still haven't dug down into the amount of people exposed to the coronavirus and numbers seem to be coming in much higher than a typical flu," said Larry Peruzzi, managing director of international equity trading at Mischler Financial. "It warrants the concern the market has showed it in recent days."
Earnings drove some of the biggest moves in individual stocks.
Shares of Apple rose 2.1%, or $6.65, to $324.34 after the company reported record revenue and a return to profit growth in the latest quarter.
General Electric shares added 10%, or $1.21, to $12.94 after the conglomerate gave an upbeat outlook for 2020.
Shares of McDonald's rose 1.9%, or $4.05, to $214.44 after the chain topped analysts' expectations.
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, one of the stock market's biggest gainers last year, slid 6%, or $3.02, to $47.51 after the chip maker gave a conservative outlook for 2020.
Hess shares fell 6.9%, or $4.30, to $57.82 after the energy company reported a bigger-than-expected loss for the fourth quarter.
L Brands jumped 13%, or $2.66, to $23.22 after The Wall Street Journal reported that Chief Executive Leslie Wexner is in discussions to step aside and is exploring strategic alternatives for the lingerie brand, citing people familiar with the matter.
Boeing, meanwhile, added 1.7%, or $5.46, to $322.02 after it posted its first annual loss in more than two decades because of issues surrounding its 737 MAX jets. Shares remain down 12% over the past 12 months.
In after-hours trading, Facebook shares dropped about 8%, despite reporting stronger-than-expected growth in earnings, revenue and daily users. Expenses rose.
Tesla shares climbed about 12% after hours when the electric-car maker reported record deliveries and higher revenue.
Elsewhere, the Euro Stoxx 600 rose 0.4%.
At midday in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average was down 1.6%. Elsewhere in the Asia/Pacific region, South Korea's Kospi was down 0.9% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.5%.

The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate intact Wednesday and indicated it was perfectly content keeping it there for the near term. But the new and rising threat from the mysterious coronavirus could very well change that calculus.
Just as other troubling economic clouds were lifting with this month's signing of a partial U.S.-China trade deal and improving prospects in Europe, the spreading of the respiratory infection, believed to have originated in China, has already disrupted numerous companies' operations. It has reignited uncertainties about the outlook, which have slowed business investments and at times jolted financial markets.
Fed Chairman Jerome H. Powell, in a news conference after policymakers' two-day meeting, told reporters that it was too early to know about the effects of the virus, but he described it as "a significant thing" with potentially widespread repercussions for the global economy.
Powell didn't downplay the risk or call it a likely transitory event, as some analysts were expecting.
"The Chinese economy is very important in the global economy now and, you know, when China's economy slows down, we do feel that," Powell said.
A broad array of U.S. and other global companies have temporarily closed down operations in China or are evacuating workers especially from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
The pneumonia-like ailment already has sickened more than 6,000 people in China and 19 other countries or territories, with more than 130 deaths.
The Chinese government has effectively quarantined Wuhan and other cities across Hubei province in an unprecedented lockdown affecting more than 50 million people.
Honda and other car companies, and tech firms including Facebook and Microsoft, are extracting workers from China or banning their staff from China travel.
Starbucks, McDonald's and retailers such as H&M have temporarily closed many of their China outlets. And major airlines including British Airways and Lufthansa have indefinitely suspended direct flights to and from China.
Russell Johnson is the founder and president of China Array Plastics, a plastic injection-molding business.
He's been manufacturing in Wuhan since the early 1980s, first through a contractor and in more recent years at his own factory.
Several days before the Chinese New Year holiday and last Thursday's lockdown of Wuhan, Johnson closed his factory to shield his 20 employees from possible exposure to the virus.
Since then he's been checking in with his staff daily. "They seem pretty calm. They're basically staying at home, playing mah-jongg and just taking it easy," he said.
But the big question for Johnson, the Fed and everybody else is, how long will it be before the outbreak is contained and things return to normal?
"We're just in a holding pattern," he said Wednesday.
"If it can get resolved in weeks to a couple of months, we can weather that. But if it lasts longer than three months, then it's going to be difficult for everybody," he added.
Many analysts have looked for clues from an earlier China outbreak of a similar virus -- severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which lasted for about six months in 2002 and 2003. There were almost 8,100 cases of SARS that resulted in 774 deaths reported in some two dozen countries.
But global air traffic today is twice as big as in the early 2000s, increasing the likelihood of potentially wider spread of the disease. China's outbound tourists -- about 16.6 million in 2002 -- reached about 150 million in 2018.
SARS temporarily slowed growth in China and rippled mostly to nearby Asian countries. But as Powell suggested, China's growth since then means its influence is far greater now.
Back in 2002, China accounted for just 8% of the global economy, on a purchasing parity basis.
But it's about 20% today, with many American and other global firms dependent on Chinese supply chains and the nation's vast markets.
"The China virus is the 800-pound gorilla in the room when it comes to the risks that the global economy faces," said Christopher Rupkey, managing director and chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
"If U.S. exports continue to fade in response to slowing world growth and trade," he said, "the U.S. manufacturing recession could cause a real recession and bring the Federal Reserve back into the picture with rate cuts in a hurry."
The U.S. economy grew at about 3% in 2018, slowed to around 2% last year and is likely to drop a bit further this year, according to Fed projections and many private analysts.
The recent Phase 1 trade deal between the U.S. and China could give a lift to business investment, but it's uncertain how long the truce will last.
"Trade policy uncertainty remains elevated," Powell said. "Businesses continue to identify it as an ongoing risk."
Now the coronavirus injects a new element of uncertainty that could push the Fed to nudge down interest rates. The central bank cut rates three times last year after hiking them four times in 2018.
What's more, Powell will almost certainly face pressure from President Trump to cut rates.
"Clearly Mr. Trump is using the Fed as a political football, almost on a weekly basis," said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, an accounting and consulting firm.
Financial markets are now expecting a rate cut by the end of October, he said, but the Fed will be hard-pressed to make a move given the political criticisms that it will almost certainly endure in an election year.
"They want nothing to do with a rate cut or a rate hike before the election," Brusuelas said.

Concerns include return of students from China, close quarters on campus
University officials in the United States are scrambling to prepare for the potential arrival of the novel coronavirus on their campuses, even as the health crisis already affects research, travel and, in a few cases, daily life.
At Arizona State University, where a member of the community has tested positive for the virus, a petition calling on the school to cancel classes or do more to protect the community's health had garnered more than 21,000 online signatures by Wednesday afternoon. 
The student who created the petition wrote, 'The students of ASU do not feel comfortable attending classes due to the outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus. Until proper precautions have been taken to ensure the wellbeing of the students, such as disinfecting areas the student with Novel Coronavirus was present, ASU students want their classes canceled.'
The State Press, a campus newspaper, reported that nearby stores were running out of face masks and published photos of students wearing masks to try to prevent infection.
School officials declined to say whether the infected person was a student or staff member, or to provide information beyond campus announcements emphasizing the risk was low and that university operations were continuing as normal. The infected person in Tempe does not live in university housing and is in isolation, officials said.
On Tuesday, the school's president, Michael Crow, announced a restriction on travel to China following advice from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It's not surprising that coronavirus fears have arrived at U.S. universities, said Lauren Gardner, an associate professor and co-director of the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. 
'Cities with big universities are definitely at risk, because there's a huge population of Chinese students that are studying abroad,' Gardner said.
The public health challenge in China also has forced two U.S. universities with substantial operations in and near Shanghai to delay their spring semesters.
New York University in Shanghai and nearby Duke Kunshan University, which is a joint venture of Duke and Wuhan universities, serve students from China, the United States and elsewhere. The schools announced their terms will begin Feb. 17, two weeks later than planned. Currently, students are on break for the Lunar New Year.
NYU Shanghai officials said they are working to put as many classes online as possible to enable students to make progress toward their degrees from remote locations.
'We are enormously grateful to all of our students, to our faculty, and to our administrative staff for showing creativity and resilience in the face of these new challenges,' NYU Shanghai's top officials said in a statement Tuesday.
Duke Kunshan officials said members of their community who traveled home during the break were advised to stay there.
Officials at Duke's campus in North Carolina said Duke Kunshan is providing housing, food and medical care for students not able to return home during the break. As of Wednesday, Duke said, there were about 70 students on Duke Kunshan's campus, plus roughly 20 university employees. But the university said the number is declining. Normally, Duke Kunshan is home to about 700 students and 250 faculty and staff members.
At George Mason University, a student has been tested for the virus and is awaiting results, school officials told the campus. The student does not live on the Northern Virginia campus and remains in isolation while the CDC conducts a laboratory test, according to the school's announcement, which said the risk to the public and those on campus remains low.
Other schools, such as Miami University in Ohio, are awaiting results from students who recently traveled in China and were exhibiting symptoms.
At the University of Washington, two students are awaiting test results, and a third student tested negative for the coronavirus. A committee has been meeting daily to assess the situation, said Geoffrey S. Gottlieb, interim chairman of the school's advisory committee on communicable diseases and a professor of medicine specializing in infectious diseases. The challenges include the number of people in the university system and the risk of infection associated with communal living.
'And certainly parents are always worried about their children when they're off at college,' Gottlieb said. It can be challenging trying to ease concerns and ensuring that students and parents have the best data and public-health recommendations, he said, so campus officials are working to provide information and allay fears.
Gardner, who does mathematical modeling to predict the spread of infectious diseases, began mapping the coronavirus with a graduate student at Johns Hopkins. Last week, she shared on social media the dashboard that tracks the location of confirmed cases. By early Tuesday it had been viewed more than 350-million times, she said.

China rushes to limit political risk from health crisis

Amid viral illness, party organs hedge president's exposure to criticism
BEIJING " As a trade war with the United States accelerated last January, Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a meeting with top Communist Party officials to warn about the surprise emergence of 'black swan events' that could destabilize their 70-year rule.
Exactly one year later, an unexpected challenge did emerge " not from the halls of Washington but from market stalls in Wuhan.
While China battles a coronavirus epidemic with potentially far-reaching implications for global public health and the domestic economy, the Communist Party is scrambling to delicately manage the political risk as citizens fume over how officials bungled the initial response to the outbreak.
'This is the kind of 'black swan' moment when the fundamental legitimacy of the party is at stake,' said Kerry Brown, a professor at King's College London who was first secretary in the British Embassy in Beijing during China's last major epidemic, the 2002 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
'It's the moment when the party is supposed to show the merit of its highly controlled, highly coordinated system and its side of the social contract,' Brown said. Instead, 'people seem to be getting more and more nervous.'
In recent days, China's central leaders have appeared to take a bifurcated approach to defuse discontent: allow citizens to vent about the failures of local officials in Wuhan " who initially covered up and ignored the coronavirus " while circling protective wagons around Xi, the president who has sought to cultivate an image as a beloved 'People's Leader.'
'Public perception will be shaped by the propaganda machinery, and that machinery is going into overdrive right now to protect Xi's reputation,' said Steve Tsang, the director of the China Institute at SOAS University of London.
As the crisis snowballs unpredictably this week, party media organs have carefully hedged Xi's political exposure.
After Xi met World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Tuesday, Chinese state media initially carried video showing him telling Tedros that he 'personally directed' the response to the outbreak. But later, state outlets quoted Xi saying that his administration was 'collectively directing' the response.
Xi has been shown once on television, on Lunar New Year's Day, decisively ordering the formation of an epidemic response team. But he did not name himself the head of that commission.
Chinese officials may fear a political 'catastrophe' if the virus were to continue spreading to major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, said Victor Shih, an expert on the Chinese political economy at the University of California at San Diego.
'If Xi was fully confident of a victorious outcome against the disease, why not put himself in charge . . . and reap all of the glories?' Shih said.
Popular faith in Xi, who has pitched his strongman style as more effective than the decentralized administrations of his predecessors, could 'evaporate' if the situation worsened dramatically, Shih added.
As nearly 55 million people adjust to an indefinite quarantine in central China and international airlines begin cutting flights to the country, frustrations are running high.
On Twitter, a service that is inaccessible inside China without the use of special software, Chinese users widely shared video of a Wuhan woman angrily wondering how the Communist Party could 'build a moderately prosperous society if there were no people left.'
Others flocked to Douban, a Chinese equivalent of IMDB.com, where they left coded reviews about the HBO miniseries 'Chernobyl.' Many linked the official ineptitude in present-day China and the Soviet Union's final years and hinted that the Wuhan virus was something of a Chernobyl moment.
'There are so many similarities,' wrote the viewer 'jianghai jiyusheng.' 'Will there be a show in a few years about the Wuhan pneumonia?'
The Chernobyl nuclear meltdown in 1986 is widely seen as hastening the collapse of the Soviet Union a few years later.
By Tuesday, China's authorities had seen enough. Censors did not take down the Chernobyl reviews outright but made the page invisible to anybody who wasn't logged in with an account.
For all the public's frustrations about their government, political observers say, many seem to be rallying around the top leadership. After Xi issued direct orders effectively putting the country on war footing on Saturday, the gears of government accelerated. Top public health and transportation officials announced urgent new measures. Medical teams across the country were deployed to the vast quarantine zone. State media live-streamed and touted how Chinese construction teams were able to build makeshift hospitals in a matter of days.
On Wednesday, a state-owned outlet called the Paper released a nationwide opinion survey showing Chinese broadly panning the recent performance of officials in the city of Wuhan and in wider Hubei province but retaining a high level of faith in their central leaders in Beijing.
Dali Yang, an expert on China's politics and governance at the University of Chicago, said the government appeared to be content to let blame fall on lower officials as long as people did not question the basic legitimacy of the party or its bureaucratic culture. And authorities seemed even to be allowing a rare degree of dissent and debate about government transparency, he said.
'Blaming the locals is a time-honored strategy,' Yang said.
Indeed, China's Internet this week has been rife with users freely mocking the party chief in Wuhan, the center of the new coronavirus, for tripping over his words about how protective masks can be produced. Others poked fun at a Hubei county that switched all its traffic lights to red in an effort to enforce the quarantine.
WeChat, the ubiquitous social media service, warned users that anyone who 'spread rumors' about the virus could be jailed for up to seven years.
But after citizens broadly condemned Wuhan authorities for detaining and silencing doctors who reported the existence of the new virus four weeks ago, China's highest court stepped in and reprimanded the local police for silencing whistleblowers.
'Rumors stop when information is public,' the usually conservative Supreme People's Court said Tuesday on social media as it urged Wuhan officials to learn a 'profound lesson.'
In a state television interview this week, Wuhan's mayor, Zhou Xianwang, offered to resign, saying he was willing to take the fall if that would assuage popular anger.
After the crisis subsides, the Communist Party is likely to dismiss a number of local officials, depending on how bad things become, said Tsang, the SOAS professor.
'They will conclude the problem was not too much concentration of power, but rather not enough concentration of power' at the top, he said. 'A few officials will be held accountable. And none of them will be Xi Jinping.'

Utilities Stocks Set for Biggest Monthly Gains Since 2016; Sector is up 6.1% this month as investors turn defensive on virus fears

Utilities stocks have been among this month's winning bets as the widening coronavirus outbreak has sent investors scurrying for safety.
The sector has risen 6.1% in the S&P 500 so far in January, on pace for its best month since June 2016, when the U.K.'s Brexit referendum sparked a broad market panic. The S&P 500 itself is up 1.3% for the month.
Utilities are outperforming every other sector in the index, even inching ahead of the technology sector, which has been an investor darling in the long-running bull market. Tech stocks in the S&P 500 have climbed 5.9% to start 2020.
The S&P 500's worst-performing sector, energy, has fallen 9.1% as the outbreak that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan has led to growing travel disruptions and sparked concerns that it could weigh on global economic growth.
More than 130 people have died from the virus. Thousands more cases have been confirmed, mostly in mainland China, though some have cropped up in the U.S., Europe and Australia.
Utilities are generally seen as a defensive play, rising on fears of a market downturn, because people still need to pay their gas and electric bills each month, even when they cut spending elsewhere.
Many utilities also pay dividends, allowing their investors to earn a bond-like income even if the companies' share prices don't appreciate much. With low interest rates making bonds themselves less attractive—the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was 1.593% on Wednesday, down sharply from a year ago—that has sweetened the attraction of utilities.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Have you invested more of your portfolio in the utilities sector lately, or are you considering it? Why? Join the conversation below.
Among the best-performing utilities stocks are American Water Works Co., which is up 11% for the month; Evergy Inc., which serves customers in Kansas and Missouri, up 11%; and Atlanta-based Southern Co., up 10%.

The latest Market Talks covering Basic Materials. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.
0730 GMT - JSW Steel's earnings outlook is improving, with FY 2021 likely to see better demand and cost synergies, Nomura says, raising the stock's target price to INR330 from INR316 while maintaining a buy rating. Steel spreads are expected to improve from 4Q on lower input costs and a possible increase in steel prices. With lower losses overseas, the company's profitability should improve during FY 2021-2022. Nomura expects sustained steel demand growth of 5%-6%, fueled by INR74 trillion to INR75 trillion of infrastructure spending over FY 2020-2025. JSW Steel shares are up 3.2% at INR263.50. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)
2306 GMT - Macquarie analysts are pleased with nickel producer Western Areas's fiscal 2Q result, saying it was broadly in line with expectations. Macquarie also says that new offtake agreements with a BHP unit and Chinese resources company Jinchuan Co. will be more lucrative than previous agreements. "WSA's ability to deliver consistent production results continued in 2Q," Macquarie says. Western Areas shares fell 3.6% Tuesday after the result, amid a broader selloff tied to fears about the coronavirus in China. (mike.cherney@wsj.com; @Mike_Cherney)
2036 GMT - Canadian stocks, hit hard by concerns about the deadly coronavirus outbreak, close higher Tuesday. The healthcare sector was one of the biggest gainers, while gold companies were some of the largest decliners. The benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index improves 0.3% to 17500.88, while the blue-chip S&P/TSX 60 Index increases 0.4% to 1045.14. (maria.armental@wsj.com; @mjarmental)
2022 GMT - Nucor, the largest steelmaker in the US, is echoing the sentiments Steel Dynamics and other competitors in predicting the US steel market won't repeat 2019's doldrums in 2020. Prices and demand for steel have strengthened since December, stoking steelmakers' optimism for higher sales and profit this year. "We are encouraged by improving conditions in the US steel market. We believe this reflects the end of the severe inventory destocking that occurred last year," CFO Jim Frias told analysts. Steelmakers though have been guilty of overreacting before to short-lived market rallies only to see prices and demand quickly retreat when customers have replenished their inventories. Nucor closed up 0.59% at $49.47 (robert.tita@wsj.com; @bob_tita)
1952 GMT - A surge in new mills to make flat-rolled steel in the US won't dissuade Nucor from moving forward with the construction of its plate mill in Brandenburg, Ky. Steel industry analysts warn the US steel market will become flooded in a few years when all the new mills enter service. "We've been in this now for 20 years," Nucor CEO Leon Leon Topalian says. "We understand the customer base. This is something that we've contemplated going back to 2008." Nucor recently broke ground for the $1.35B mill, which will be able to produce up to 1.2 million tons of steel plate annually. Production at Brandenburg is scheduled to start in 2022. (robert.tita@wsj.com; @bob_tita)
1849 GMT - Demand from nonresidential customers like steel fabricators and the expectation that a move from buyers to lower inventories has concluded are expected to help steel producer Nucor this year, executives say. "We do see 2020 shaping up to be better than 2019," CEO Leon Topalian tells analysts on an earnings call. "We see the outlook as fairly optimistic." He flags the trade deal between the US, Mexico and Canada as specifically good for the US steel industry, given rules that Topalian says will incentivize the use of North American steel in automobiles, auto parts and other items. Shares gain 1.3% to $49.82. (micah.maidenberg@wsj.com; @MicahMaidenberg)
1540 GMT - German chemicals company Wacker Chemie has banned business travel for its employees from and to China as a precautionary measure and until further notice due to the coronavirus outbreak, the company said. "Our health service is monitoring further developments and will propose further measures to the company management if necessary," the company said. Wacker Chemie employs around 1,000 staff members at three productions sites and seven sales offices in China. (kim.richters@wsj.com)
1531 GMT - Fresnillo is facing a potential turnaround year in 2020, says Numis Securities ahead of the Mexican silver miner's trading statement Wednesday. The main catalysts for the stock should be the commissioning of the company's new Juanicipio mine and demonstrating an operational revival across the portfolio, but specifically at the group's Fresnillo and San Julian operations, says analyst Jonathan Guy. "We retain a buy recommendation and a target price of 900 pence." Shares drop 3% to 619p. (philip.waller@wsj.com)
1437 GMT - Wheat prices are slightly lower in Paris and Chicago, having outperformed other agricultural commodities so far this year. "Even though the market has been tight, the advance has been overdone," says Nicolas Robin, who manages commodity investments at Columbia Threadneedle. Wheat prices have risen too far above corn prices, Robin says, encouraging farmers to feed their animals with corn instead of wheat. Elsewhere in agricultural and soft-commodity markets, Robin is betting on higher soybean prices, and thinks U.S. pork prices will rise in response to larger purchases from China. "We like the lean-hog market right now," he says, adding that Chinese import demand is likely to rise once the trade deal with the U.S. starts to kick in. (joe.wallace@wsj.com)
1048 GMT - Kenmare should end the year producing much more ilmenite than it did in 2019, but that guidance remains sensible, says Peel Hunt. The brokerage says the company is producing at a run-rate that will push it to reach 1.2 million tons a year of ilmenite, up from 893,000 tons in 2019. "With the works going on in 2020 we feel conservative guidance from management is sensible," it says. Peel Hunt maintains a buy rating on the stock with a reduced target price of 425 pence, down from 450 pence. (adriano.marchese@wsj.com)
1042 GMT - Antofagasta should see an increase in EBITDA for 2019 but lower earnings per share due to higher depreciation charges and a one-off increase in withholding taxes, Peel Hunt says. 2019 production levels, which saw more metal being produced and sold at a marginally lower unit cost, will further increases in revenue and EBITDA, the brokerage says. "That said, higher depreciation charges and a one-off increase in withholding taxes for 2019 mean that despite improved EBITDA, EPS actually falls," it says. Peel Hunt has a hold rating on the stock and raises its target price to 940 pence from 915 pence. (adriano.marchese@wsj.com)
1038 GMT - Barrick Gold's talk of stocking up on copper, whether through a deal with Freeport-McMoRan or elsewhere, is upsetting some investors whose remit is just gold. Joe Foster, who runs the VanEck International Investors Gold Fund--one of Barrick's largest investors--wants companies in his portfolio to produce at least 80% of revenues from gold. Stocking up on copper or combining with Freeport could take Barrick below that level. In this event, Foster says he "would have to consider my position" as a Barrick investor.

Tesla Inc. is expected to release fourth-quarter financial results after the market closes Wednesday. Tesla delivered 367,500 vehicles in 2019, a 50% rise from 2018. That met Chief Executive Elon Musk's goal of delivering between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles globally last year. The results have helped fuel Tesla's meteoric share price rise , putting the company's market value at a level greater than most of the world's largest auto makers despite selling a fraction of the vehicles and never turning an annual profit. Here's what you need to know:
EARNINGS FORECAST: Tesla is expected to post an adjusted profit of $1.77 a share in the quarter, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet, compared with an adjusted profit of $1.93 a share a year earlier. The full-year adjusted-per-share loss is expected to come in at 44 cents, as of Wednesday afternoon.
REVENUE FORECAST: Revenue is expected to fall to $6.99 billion in the quarter, according to FactSet, from $7.23 billion a year earlier. Tesla said earlier this month that total vehicle deliveries reached a record 112,000 during the period, up sharply from early 2019 when sales disappointed and investors questioned whether demand for the electric car company's vehicles had peaked. The expected fourth-quarter revenue drop highlights a challenge for Tesla as it focuses on delivering its new Model 3 compact car, which on average sold for an estimated $47,700 last quarter. The older Model S large sedan and Model X sport-utility vehicle, which traditionally sold for around $100,000, have seen softer demand. Combined deliveries of the most expensive models fell to a combined 19,450 vehicles in the fourth quarter, down from 27,550 a year earlier.
WHAT TO WATCH
THE ROAD AHEAD: Wall Street will be looking for the company to forecast its expected sales growth for the year. Analysts on average predict deliveries will rise 27% to 468,000 this year. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas expects the company to set a target of 500,000 to 550,000. Cost improvements and increased production from Tesla's China factory could drive the car maker's first full-year profit, Mr. Jonas said in a note. Analysts on average are predicting that Tesla will report a full-year profit of $6.78 a share for 2020.
CHINA: Mr. Musk earlier this month celebrated the opening of the company's Shanghai assembly factory , its first outside the U.S. Tesla has already begun delivering China-made Model 3 cars to customers there. Investors will be looking for details on how efforts to increase production there are going, including sustaining the goal of making 3,000 vehicles in China a week. All that comes amid concerns that demand in China for new vehicles has been waning. The overall new vehicle market has fallen two years in a row in China and deliveries of electric vehicles struggled last year as the government pulled back on subsidies. Tesla needs to outperform the market. China remains "the key fuel in the growth engine" for Tesla, Daniel Ives, an analyst for Wedbush Securities, told investors. "2020 represents a pivotal year for Musk &Co."
CORONAVIRUS: Just as Tesla is looking to boost production in Shanghai, the company joins others in facing the uncertainty brought about by the spread of the coronavirus. Car companies are bracing for disruption with the epicenter of the virus affecting central China where the auto industry has a large footprint. Investors could be looking for details on Tesla's China supply chain and how it might be affected. Even without the threat of the coronavirus, Wall Street has been trying to better understand Tesla's plans for sourcing batteries for its China factory.
MODEL Y: In October, Tesla revealed that its plan to begin production of the Model Y, a compact sport-utility vehicle based on the same platform as the Model 3, were ahead of schedule. Production is expected to begin this summer. Investors will be looking for details on how that effort is going.

Fed Likely to Hold Interest Rates Steady; Officials are focused on fine-tuning their balance sheet and inflation-targeting policy, but notable announcements aren't expected Wednesday

FULL TEXT
Federal Reserve officials are likely to hold interest rates steady and maintain their wait-and-see policy stance after their two-day meeting ends Wednesday.
They cut rates three times last year , lowering their benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 1.5% and 1.75%, after raising it four times in 2018.
Officials are likely to discuss several important behind-the-scenes policy considerations this week, but aren't expected to decide on any immediate action.
The Fed releases its policy statement at 2 p.m. ET, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will deliver a longer statement and answer questions from reporters starting at 2:30 p.m. Here's what to watch:
Economic Outlook
Since Fed officials' December meeting, financial markets had been ebullient due to a trade truce between the U.S. and China and glimmers of firmer global manufacturing activity. But fears about China's coronavirus outbreak reignited global growth worries in recent days, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield earlier this week below 1.6%, its lowest level since October.
Officials are likely to make just minimal changes to their policy statement, leaving Mr. Powell to convey any nuances about how they view the growth outlook.
While they are holding rates steady for now, they have signaled they see greater risks of surprises that could force them to lower rates than to lift them. The coronavirus is the latest example of such a development.
Mr. Powell has essentially ruled out reversing last year's rate cuts for the foreseeable future by saying he would want to see a persistent and sustained rise in inflation before lifting rates. The Fed staff doesn't forecast this happening for several years.
Reserve Balances
With rates on hold, the focus at this week's meeting shifts to officials' progress—or lack thereof—in fine-tuning their control of short-term rates .
Fed officials avoided a much-feared spike in overnight lending rates at the end of the year, a sign that flooding cash markets with plentiful loans has worked for now. The question they now face is what amount of bank deposits held at the Fed, called reserves, they think will be needed once they curtail their current lending operations and their purchases of Treasury bills.
Buying Treasury bills is designed to rebuild reserves that officials think fell too low last September. They have suggested they will eventually transition from their current monthly pace of $60 billion in purchases to a lower level—around $10 billion or $15 billion, according to private-sector analysts—to keep up with normal currency growth.
How long they continue their market interventions will depend on the quantity of reserves officials want to maintain in the system. Officials haven't answered this critical question publicly, with Mr. Powell instead saying the level of reserves should be no lower than $1.45 trillion.
Reserves are currently slightly more than $1.6 trillion, but only because of Fed bill purchases and lending in a key market for secured debt called repurchase agreements.
What to Call It
Mr. Powell has said repeatedly that bill purchases aren't the same thing as the Fed's post-2008 policies to stimulate growth by buying Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, called quantitative easing or QE. But a market rally from October until January led commentators to argue that the purchases are akin to QE.
The debate over this matters because if investors believe these policies are providing support to financial markets, that could complicate efforts to phase them down this spring or summer. Given market sensitivity to balance sheet policy in the past, investors are likely to closely follow how Mr. Powell addresses these questions in his press conference.
Technical Adjustment
The Fed's market interventions have pinned the effective fed-funds rate near the bottom of its range, at 1.55%, which matches a separate rate the Fed pays banks on reserves.
When the banking sector was awash in reserves, the Fed set the rate on reserves at the top of the fed-funds range. But as the Fed drained reserves from the system between 2017 and 2019, the fed-funds rate traded slightly higher in the range. Twice in 2018 and twice last year, the Fed lowered the interest rate on reserves relative to the top of the fed-funds range, each time by 0.05 percentage point, to keep fed-funds trading well within the middle of its range.
A top Fed manager flagged the possibility at their December meeting that officials at some point would need to lift the interest rate on reserves by 0.05 percentage point to keep the fed-funds rate in the middle of the range. This would reverse the most recent cut officials made to the reserves rate in September, when very short-term lending rates spiked because banks were reluctant to lend reserves.
Most analysts expect the Fed to increase this rate, but it is an open question whether it will do so Wednesday or revisit the question at its next meeting in mid-March. If the Fed does lift the interest rate on reserves, Mr. Powell is likely to say that the decision is purely technical, as he has done every time they adjusted it previously.
Framework Review
The Fed is likely to continue discussions on the review of its inflation-targeting framework, but conclusions aren't expected for several more months. Given the continuing review, officials decided last month not to release their annual statement on longer-run policy goals this week, as they typically do every January.

Filled with uncertainty

As an outbreak of a new viral illness that emerged in China continues to spread, travelers and businesses have begun heeding U.S. health officials' recommendation to avoid nonessential travel to the country. 
Meanwhile, companies in the travel industry are watching to see how far the virus -- and travel fears -- will spread.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday advised travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to China, where the respiratory virus has killed more than 100 and sickened more than 2,700 people. Five cases have been confirmed in the U.S., all among people who traveled to Wuhan, the city where the virus was first detected, health officials said. One of those cases was a woman from Chicago.
United Airlines said demand for flights to China has declined so significantly that it canceled 24 flights between its U.S. hub cities and Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai scheduled for the first week of February, including some connecting Chicago to Beijing and Shanghai. The airline typically operates about 12 flights a day between the U.S. and China.
"We will continue to monitor the situation as it develops and will adjust our schedule as needed," United said in a statement.
The airline declined to comment on the potential financial impact.
Loren Rivkin, executive vice president of Northbrook-based industrial safety products company Saf-T-Gard, called off a planned trip to visit factories and customers in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Southern China on Monday after two colleagues he had planned to meet with advised him to postpone the trip.
"I just decided it wasn't worth it," Rivkin said.
Airlines have let passengers request refunds for travel to Wuhan or reschedule flights to other cities in China, and Chicago-based Hyatt Hotels Corp. said it would let guests postpone or cancel stays at its hotels in China through Feb. 10.
Visa and passport expediting service Swift Passport Services said companies, study abroad programs and individual travelers all had been in touch to say they were canceling upcoming trips and no longer needed visas, said CEO Laurie Lee.
Two corporate clients told Lee they were putting employee travel to China on hold into March and asked Lee not to approve employees' requests for visas.
Two university study abroad programs and one private study abroad provider had also been in touch with Swift, saying they were canceling programs in China. The universities said they planned to give students the option to pick a different overseas destination, but "that requires they get a visa ASAP," Lee said.
Kraft Heinz has banned employee travel to and from China until further notice and plans to let employees who live in China work from home when they return from Lunar New Year celebrations, spokesman Michael Mullen said in an email.
As for leisure travel, it's too soon to say whether concerns about the virus will encourage some to avoid the region altogether, said Olivia Link, a travel adviser at Glencoe-based Lake Shore Travel.
"It will depend on what we learn about how it's spreading and the incubation period. There's so much uncertainty right now," she said.
Brett Cumberland, managing director of Chicago-based luxury tour operator R. Crusoe &Son and The Andrew Harper Travel Office, said he didn't have any clients in China but was concerned about the virus's potential impact on a boom in travel to Japan around the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo this summer.
"Our concern is not just for China and what's going on there, but can we hold on to Japan," he said.
During the SARS outbreak, "people were a little cautious, and it did put a halt on some travel," said Paula Dunlap, a travel advisor with Direct Travel Luxe in Naperville. But it's too soon to say whether the new virus will be as disruptive, she said.
Airlines in the Asia-Pacific region lost about 8% of their annual passenger traffic at the height of the 2003 SARS outbreak, equivalent to about $6 billion in lost revenues, according to a report from the International Air Transport Association. North American airlines lost about 3.7% of international traffic, or an estimated $1 billion in lost revenues.
Travel rebounded within nine months, and later avian flu and MERS epidemics had milder effects on air travel, suggesting the disruption from the new virus will be temporary, the report said.
But the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak also is striking during the Lunar New Year celebrations, a particularly busy travel period. January 2019 was the second-busiest month for travel from China to the U.S. during the 12 months ending Nov. 30, according to data from the association.
Last week during their earnings calls, executives at United and American said it was too soon to determine the economic impact of the virus.
"We have in the past effectively managed situations like this one to keep our people safe. And in doing so, we've seen demand bounce back. Managing through uncertainty is something that every airline in the world has to do," United President Scott Kirby told analysts on the call.
The outbreak, which has spread to a dozen countries, comes just as hopes were rising that Chinese tourism to the U.S. would start to recover following two years of decline due to the prolonged trade dispute between the two countries.
In 2018, travel from China to the U.S. fell for the first time in 15 years, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office, which collects data from U.S. Customs forms. The office forecast a further decline of 5% in 2019 but predicted a return to growth in 2020 and beyond.
China remains the fifth-largest source of foreign tourism to the U.S., behind Canada, Mexico, the U.K. and Japan. Nearly 3 million Chinese traveled to the U.S. in 2018, spending more than $36 billion.
Investors have been rattled by the potential for a wider economic impact from the outbreak. Overnight Monday, a sell-off on Wall Street gave the Dow Jones Industrial Average its first 5-day losing streak since early August and handed the S&P 500 its worst day since early October.
At least one traveler wasn't overly wary. John Rogers, 70, who recently returned to Chicago after living in China for six years, is scheduled to fly to Hainan, an island south of mainland China, to judge a national law school competition at the end of February. Rogers, who said he visited China during the SARS outbreak, said he would be comfortable making the trip but "fully expects to get a note saying it will be postponed or canceled."
In the meantime, travelers who canceled or delayed trips are trying to assess when they will feel comfortable returning.
Peter Compernolle, of Chicago, said he typically travels to China to visit his wife's parents each year in late spring but doesn't expect to make plans anytime soon.
"We're keeping a close eye on the spread of coronavirus both because we have family there, and also because we sometimes need to go back there unexpectedly," he wrote in an email.
Rivkin said he plans to follow recommendations from the CDC before scheduling another trip.
"I'm waiting for some kind of clearance it's contained and controlled,' he said.

Here are some of the companies with shares expected to trade actively in Wednesday's session. Stock movements noted by ticker reflect movements during regular trading hours.
Apple: The company posted record revenue and a return to profit growth in its latest quarter behind strong sales of iPhones, apps and AirPod wireless earbuds.
eBay: The online marketplace reported a decline in profit on weak sales in the latest quarter, amid a strategic review that led it to shake up its leadership ranks and sell off part of its business.
Starbucks: The coffee chain said customers in the U.S. helped to drive up sales in its latest quarter , but it has closed more than half of its stores in China because of the coronavirus outbreak.
Xilinx: The chip maker reported its first quarterly revenue decline in four years and said it plans to cut about 7% of its workforce , blaming a "perfect storm" of a slowdown in fifth-generation technology investments and the impact of trade restrictions blocking business with China's Huawei.
AT&T, Tesla, PayPal, Microsoft and Facebook are among the companies reporting earnings Wednesday.

Business News: Starbucks Closes Stores Amid Virus --- Temporary move in China comes as coffee chain posts increase in U.S. sales for quarter

Starbucks Corp. said customers in the U.S. helped to drive up sales in its latest quarter, but the coffee chain faces a new threat to business in China after temporarily closing more than half of its stores in China because of the coronavirus outbreak.
The Seattle-based company said Tuesday the closures in its second-largest market would have an effect on the fiscal second-quarter and full-year financial results. Starbucks had 4,292 stores in China at the end of last year, up 16% from 2018.
"We remain optimistic and committed to the long-term opportunity in China," Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said.
Other chains including McDonald's Corp. and Yum China Holdings Inc. also have closed stores in China as the virus has spread. The outbreak has weighed on the shares of U.S. brands with big Chinese footprints, along with the markets overall.
Starbucks said it is maintaining much of its fiscal guidance for this year, rather than raising some portions, because of the potential impact from the coronavirus.
"This is a very complex situation," said John Culver, the company's head of international channel development.
Shares in Starbucks fell 1% after hours after the chain reported $7.1 billion in revenue for its fiscal first quarter, up 7% from a year earlier.
Comparable sales, or those from company stores open for at least 13 months and excluding currency fluctuations, rose 5% globally.
The company said its comparable sales increased 6% in the U.S. and 3% in China. The domestic market gain matched the company's performance in its previous quarter, but growth in China was 2 percentage points slower than that period.
New-store construction in China fueled Starbucks's performance there.
Growth in the company's digital loyalty program and new beverages, particularly cold ones, bolstered sales globally, Starbucks said. Strong holiday sales also boosted performance during the quarter, according to the company.
Starbucks was helped in 2019 in part by its lineup of cold beverages, including nitro-cold brewed coffee drinks.
The company reported a quarterly profit of $885.7 million, or 74 cents a share, up from $760.6 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier.

Apple Posts Record Sales In Rebound --- Company returns to profit growth after slump in core iPhone business

Apple Inc. has shaken free of last year's iPhone slump, posting record revenue and a return to profit growth in the latest quarter behind strong sales of its flagship smartphone as well as apps and AirPods wireless earbuds.
The tech company reported revenue rose 9% in the December quarter to $91.82 billion, driven by blossoming sales of devices and services connected to the iPhone such as smartwatches and streaming-TV subscriptions. Sales of iPhones, which account for more than half of its revenue, rose 8% to $55.96 billion.
Shares of Apple, which have more than doubled over the past year, rose 1.5% in after-hours trading.
Apple executives said they expect the robust sales growth to continue in the current quarter, though they acknowledged the coronavirus outbreak had introduced some uncertainty in China, its second-most-important market and the country where most of its products are manufactured.
Chief Executive Tim Cook said Apple is limiting travel to China because of the health crisis and has reduced store operating hours in the country. He said Apple has alternatives sources to its suppliers in Wuhan, the region at the center of the outbreak that triggered a broad market selloff Monday. Factories outside of Wuhan have pushed back plans to reopen after the Lunar New Year to Feb. 10 from the end of January, he said.
Mr. Cook said the company's guidance for record fiscal second-quarter revenue of $63 billion to $67 billion represents a wider-than-normal range due to the uncertainty. Apple counts on China for nearly a fifth of its sales and relies on its workforce to assemble most of the iPhones, iPads and Macs it sells around the world.
The results for its fiscal first quarter marked a return to form for Apple, which last year failed to report a quarterly revenue record for the first time since the iPhone's 2007 release. A year ago, it slashed its guidance for the first time in more than 15 years. An iPhone sales slump and an economic downturn in China led to the company's first decline in fiscal-year revenue since 2016.
Apple snapped out of a slowdown in its smartphone business by introducing new services and accessories that would appeal to owners of the 900 million iPhones world-wide. The addition of a credit card and video-subscription service helped increase sales of services 17% in the latest quarter, the company said. Meanwhile, the introduction of the $250 AirPods Pro with noise cancellation helped fuel a 37% surge in the company's wearables business, which also includes smartwatches and iPods.
"Demand for AirPods continues to be phenomenal, particularly for our new addition AirPods Pro," Mr. Cook said during a call with analysts.
The growth in both those businesses has energized investors and helped the company's stock record one of the biggest one-year rallies in history. Apple's share price has more than doubled from last year's low, adding more than $725 billion to its value, well above the total value of Facebook Inc.
"This is continued evidence that services can transform the company," said Mark Stoeckle, chief executive of Adams Funds, a Baltimore-based investment firm with $2.5 billion under management that counts Apple among its largest holdings. "Tim Cook has brought out products that have not only added to revenue and earnings but done so within an ecosystem where that cash cow -- the iPhone business -- has been the beneficiary."
Net income for the latest period rose 11% to $22.24 billion, marking Apple's first quarterly profit increase in more than a year and a new company record. Per-share earnings for the quarter were $4.99; analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected $4.54.
Additional cameras on the three phone models released in September and a $50 price cut on the base model helped the iPhone business return to growth. Still, iPhone sales were below the company's December-quarter peak of $61.1 billion two years ago.
To give a jolt to its smartphone business, Apple plans to release a low-price iPhone this year that is expected to be an update to the $399 SE model it first released in 2016. It also is expected to release its first 5G iPhones in the fall, offering a new generation of wireless speed that has Wall Street analysts forecasting a return to iPhone shipment growth in 2021.
Sales in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, rebounded in the December quarter, rising 3% after a yearlong decline. Apple's sales in the region of apps, as well as smartwatches and iPads, continue to grow, even as the iPhone business is challenged by Chinese rivals and a broad slowdown in smartphone sales.
Apple blunted the challenge to its iPhone business and gained market share by reducing iPhone 11 prices, Canalys said. The firm predicted unit sales will improve with the release of a 5G iPhone in China.
"Tim Cook has made a huge bet on China, so Apple is more vulnerable than most companies on the sale and supply-chain side," said Steve Milunovich, technology strategist at Wolfe Research. He said that Apple could manage any loss in sales from people shopping less over the Lunar New Year because of the viral outbreak but would face a "worst-case scenario" if production was disrupted at factories.
In the Americas, Apple's largest geographic segment, services helped deliver a 12% increase in sales. The company launched its credit card and Apple TV+ streaming service in the U.S. in the second half of last year.
The company didn't provide subscription numbers for its Apple TV+ video service. Launched in November with a price of $4.99 a month, its marquee drama, "The Morning Show," starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell, was nominated for a Golden Globe, but other planned releases such as a film and documentary have been challenged by controversy over their subject matter.

3M Feels Manufacturing Slump And Readies Additional Layoffs

3M Co. posted lower revenue in significant U.S. markets and set plans for fresh layoffs, the latest manufacturer to exhibit signs of strain at a time of weakness for the industrial economy.
3M sells its diverse array of products in a wide swath of the economy, including to consumers, offices, manufacturers and hospitals.
While the U.S. economy remains strong overall, the manufacturing sector has contracted for five consecutive months through December. 3M's results on Tuesday showed this divergence. Units that largely serve the industrial economy posted revenue declines, while sales in units serving consumers and the health-care industry were flat.
"The industrial-production-related businesses are a little lower growth," 3M Chief Executive Mike Roman said in an interview.
Shares in 3M declined 5.7% to $165.58.
Slow rates of domestic car production, lower shale-drilling activity and slack demand from China have all weighed on U.S. manufacturers. Boeing Co.'s decision to first slow and then suspend production of its 737 MAX jetliner has also been working its way through the company's supply chain. New orders for capital goods, a proxy for business investment, fell in December from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.
3M, which makes products as diverse as Post-it Notes and industrial sandpaper, reported a fourth-quarter revenue decline of 2.6% when excluding currency movements and acquisitions, including a 2.9% drop in the U.S.
The company said it was eliminating 1,500 jobs as part of a continuing restructuring to streamline its global operations. 3M, based in St. Paul, Minn., employs 96,000 people and said last April it was cutting 2,000 jobs in underperforming business lines, such as energy and electronics.
The cuts will save the company as much as $120 million a year, 3M said.
The company booked a $134 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter related to the cuts.
3M also said Tuesday that it received a grand-jury subpoena in late December related to chemical discharges from a facility in Decatur, Ala. 3M said chemicals might have been released from that plant into the Tennessee River, and that it was cooperating with the investigation by the U.S. attorney's office for the northern district of Alabama.
The U.S. attorney's office declined to comment.
3M said sales in mainland China and Hong Kong increased 0.8% for the latest quarter, even as the economy slows there. As one of the largest makers of medical face masks, the company has boosted production to meet a surge in demand because of the global outbreak of a coronavirus in China.
"We are ramping up production in all of our facilities around the world, including in China, to full capacity. Twenty-four-seven production to meet the demand," Mr. Roman said.
At the same time, 3M said extended shutdowns at factories and other businesses in China could weigh on demand for other 3M products. The outbreak gained momentum this month, so the impact to the company's fourth quarter, which ended in December, was limited.
Sales in 3M's safety and industrial business fell 2.8% to $2.8 billion for the quarter, and sales in its transportation and electronics business declined 5.9% -- excluding currencies and acquisitions. Revenue also fell in the company's aerospace unit, which makes industrial glues and other products for plane makers. Revenue in 3M's health-care business declined 0.2%, and increased 0.2% in the company's consumer unit.
The company said sales in the latest quarter rose to $8.11 billion overall from $7.95 billion a year earlier, in part because of 3M's October completion of its $4.3 billion acquisition of wound-care company Acelity Inc. Analysts had expected revenue of $8.11 billion in the quarter, according to FactSet.
3M reported a profit of $969 million, compared with $1.35 billion a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings were $1.95 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting adjusted earnings of $2.11 a share.
For 2020, the company said it expects earnings between $9.30 and $9.75 a share. Analysts were expecting the company to earn $9.59 a share in 2020.

World News: Risk of Infection Seen Low in U.S., As Screenings Rise

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has expanded screenings of passengers for the coronavirus to 20 airports, even as health officials sought to assure the public that the virus doesn't yet pose a threat to most Americans.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said he wouldn't hesitate to declare a national health emergency if needed but underscored that there are just five confirmed cases of the virus in the U.S. so far.
"This is potentially a very serious health threat, but at this point Americans should not worry for their safety," Mr. Azar said at a news conference with officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies.
In addition to screening air travelers coming to the U.S., federal health officials said they are accelerating efforts to find vaccines and other therapies to arrest the spread of the virus that originated in China.
The State Department on Tuesday advised Americans to reconsider any travel to China and specifically to avoid Hubei province where the virus was first identified.
"Americans should not travel there," Mr. Azar said.
The Trump administration is considering suspending flights between the U.S. and China, said one person familiar with the matter, and it has signaled as much to some airlines, industry officials said. But it hasn't yet made a decision to do so, these people said. One person said a partial ban is possible, with the government restricting flights to certain cities based on exposure likelihood, availability of screening facilities and other factors. CNBC earlier reported on the possible plans.
The U.S. last week began screening at international airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Atlanta -- and added 15 more airports this week, officials said.
For the five known cases in the U.S., officials said they are taking the standard procedure of isolating patients and identifying others they came in contact with in hopes of stopping further infections.
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said, as of now, "there is no proven therapy for coronavirus infection." He said officials are working to develop a vaccine and determining if certain existing antiviral drugs can be effective.
"We are proceeding as if we will have to supply a vaccine," said Dr. Fauci. He said his institute hopes to begin an early-phase clinical trial "within the next few months."
Mr. Azar said the Chinese government interaction with the U.S. on the illnesses is significantly improved from the time years ago of the severe acute respiratory, or SARS, epidemic.
Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. CDC, said coronavirus is spreading rapidly in China. "We really don't know a lot about this new coronavirus," Dr. Redfield said.
Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said that the basic steps of identifying patients and their contacts appear to be holding the disease in check in the U.S. so far.
"Right now, we think the risk of the virus in the U.S. is low," Dr. Messonnier said.
Because the virus is new, some basic features aren't yet understood -- including how long the incubation period and infectivity periods are and whether a person can carry the virus, and infect others, without showing the symptoms.
Four strains of the coronaviruses can cause common colds, but others are more serious and even deadly, leading to SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.

Seven people in the world's gambling capital Macau have been infected with the new coronavirus, casting uncertainty over a usually busy Lunar New Year season for casinos.
Fears over the virus have hit U.S.-based casino operators. Las Vegas Sands Corp., Wynn Resorts Ltd. and MGM Resorts International have resorts in the region that generate up to 70% of revenue for the companies. From Jan. 17, stocks were down 10% for MGM Resorts, 13% for Las Vegas Sands and 18% for Wynn Resorts.
Visitors from mainland China account for more than 70% of people who travel to Macau, the only place in China where casinos are allowed.

The U.S. expanded screenings of passengers to 20 airports, and other governments took steps to reduce exposure to travelers from China, as the head of the World Health Organization praised Beijing's handling of the outbreak of a new and dangerous coronavirus.
The words of encouragement from WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in Beijing on Tuesday offered a public boost to a government response that has come under fire for a lack of transparency, but other developments illustrated continuing fears around the globe that China might not be doing enough to contain the fast-spreading virus.
The number of confirmed cases and fatalities continued to jump, with China's National Health Commission announcing 26 more deaths, bringing the total count to 132. Confirmed infections leapt to around 6,000.
Tibet reported its first suspected infection. The remote mountainous region was previously the only area of mainland China that hadn't reported evidence of the virus.
Hong Kong said it would reduce travel links to the mainland, while Singapore said it would ban travelers from China's Hubei province from entering or transiting through the Southeast Asian city-state. The Philippines Bureau of Immigration suspended issuing visas upon arrival for Chinese nationals to discourage tour groups.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised travelers to avoid all nonessential trips to China and issued a Level 3 warning for the country, citing the virus's spread and the lockdown of cities including Wuhan, which sits at the center of the outbreak.
For Wuhan's home province of Hubei, the U.S. State Department issued its highest, Level 4 alert -- the same used for North Korea, Iran and Venezuela. The department evacuated staff from its consulate in Wuhan, as well as a limited number of U.S. citizens, via a charter flight bound for Ontario, Calif., on Tuesday.
The U.K. and New Zealand followed the U.S. in advising their citizens against nonessential travel to China. France recommended a suspension of all travel to Hubei and announced plans to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan.
Some global companies are adjusting operations in China. Starbucks Corp. said it had temporarily closed more than half its stores in the country due to the outbreak. Apple Inc. limited business travel to the country, closed a retail store and limited store operating hours there. Other chains including McDonald's Corp. and Yum China Holdings Inc. have closed stores.
Facebook Inc. restricted all nonessential employee travel to China and is asking those who have recently been there to work from home for a period, according to a person familiar with the situation. Office-space startup We Co.'s WeWork shut 52 locations in eastern China until Feb. 9, in accordance with government demands.
United Airlines Holdings Inc. on Tuesday became the first U.S. carrier to cancel flights --suspending 24 round trip-flights between the U.S. and China starting Feb. 1. Air France-KLM said it canceled flights to Wuhan. The airline also is offering rebooking and cancellation at no extra charge to and from China. British Airways and Deutsche Lufthansa AG are offering similar rebooking policies.
Meanwhile, health authorities in Germany and in Sri Lanka announced their first confirmed coronavirus cases, and Japan's health minister confirmed two more cases Tuesday, including what was likely the country's first human-to-human transmission. That case involved a tour-bus driver who fell sick after chauffeuring two groups from Wuhan this month.
Taiwan's Health Ministry reported its eighth case, a man who was infected by a family member who worked in mainland China.
In Russia, tour operators suspended group tours from China and three eastern provinces that border the country halted entering road traffic, although they continue to admit Chinese visitors arriving by plane and train, according to authorities. All arrivals at the border in these provinces are being checked for fever.
In Beijing, the WHO's Dr. Tedros, as he is known, expressed confidence in China's approach to controlling the epidemic at a meeting with Foreign Minister Wang Yi and called for people to remain calm, according to a readout by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Dr. Tedros offered similar praise in a meeting later in the day with Chinese President Xi Jinping, state media reported.
The WHO has declined to declare the outbreak a global public-health emergency, citing a limited number of cases abroad and efforts to bring it under control.
South Korea also issued an alert urging "restraint" for travel to China and recommended citizens leave Hubei.
The European Union is sending two planes to repatriate its citizens from the Wuhan area, EU Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarcic said. The EU said roughly 250 French citizens would take the first plane and more than 100 EU citizens from other countries would take the second.

Outbreak Tests Investors' Bets on Global Recovery

Investors who began the year feeling largely sanguine about the stock market are struggling to make sense of whether a growing coronavirus outbreak could upend their bets on a global economic recovery.
Just days ago, global stocks looked poised to close out January on a strong note. Benchmark indexes from the S&P 500 to the Stoxx Europe 600 to India's S&P BSE Sensex climbed to records. Investors projected that with issues including the U.S. and China's trade war and central-bank rate increases in the rearview mirror, the global economy would likely be able to stage a modest rebound in 2020.
Now that view is being tested. The viral outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China, has infected thousands and spread to the U.S., Japan, South Korea and other countries. The disease threatens to hamper an already-slowing Chinese economy, in turn potentially jeopardizing the global recovery that many investors had counted on to materialize this year.
Markets bounced higher Tuesday, paring losses after anxiety over the outbreak sent stocks from Japan to Germany to the U.S. to their biggest one-day declines in months Monday.
"I don't think markets anticipated how contagious this disease has proven to be and how quickly it's spreading," said Michael Farr, chief executive of investment-management firm Farr, Miller &Washington.
Over the past several months, Mr. Farr said his firm has been gradually selling some of its riskier investments, reasoning that the stock market had already managed to run up well past what most had expected in 2019.
"It really has yet to be seen whether this [downturn] will gain traction or not," Mr. Farr said. "But it certainly seems like the ingredients for a further decline are coming together."
Experts caution that it is still too early to understand how big an economic impact the virus will have. So far, health officials say the Wuhan virus appears to be less severe than prior strains, such as the SARS coronavirus.
During prior outbreaks, markets proved resilient.
Charles Schwab analysts found the MSCI World Index declined 5.5% in the month after January 2016, when the Zika virus spread to several countries, but returned 2.9% over the course of six months. In their analysis of 13 outbreaks since 1981, analysts at the firm found the index returned an average of 0.8% over a one-month period following an outbreak and 7.1% over a six-month period.
Nevertheless, the timing of this year's outbreak is in some ways more worrisome than in prior cases. Data earlier in the month showed China's economy grew 6.1% in 2019. While that increase was within the government's target, it marked the slowest pace of expansion in nearly three decades.
Should the coronavirus outbreak fail to stabilize by March, first-quarter growth in China could slow to below 6%, Societe Generale economists said in a report.
Even just days into the deepening crisis, markets outside China have been hit by volatility.
Copper has fallen for nine straight days in their longest losing streak since October 2016. Prices for the industrial metal tend to pick up when investors are more optimistic about the prospects for economic growth.
Shares of airlines and casino operators such as Wynn Resorts Ltd., Las Vegas Sands Corp. and American Airlines Group Inc. have dropped, reflecting investors' anxieties about a potential pullback in travel spending.
In the U.S., the S&P 500 ended Monday down 1.6%, marking its worst session since October. The broad index rose 1% on Tuesday.
Morgan Stanley predicted the S&P 500 could drop as much as 5% before the current stretch of declines is over.
Ultimately, however, money managers have more questions than answers.
During the SARS outbreak in 2003, "the hit to economic growth was measurable, albeit short-lived," said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management, in emailed comments.
The extent to which the markets slide this time around will depend on "the length, depth and breadth of the economic impact" of the outbreak, Ms. Nixon said, adding that she would be carefully monitoring news reports in the coming days.

Rally in Treasurys Takes a Breather

A global bond rally paused after fears about the economic fallout from a viral outbreak in China pushed yields on U.S. government debt to their lowest levels in months.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury recovered to 1.642% after bottoming at 1.57%, according to Tradeweb. That is up from 1.605% Monday and snaps three trading days of yield declines.
Some investors said they were waiting for more information before evaluating the potential economic damage from the coronavirus's spread. They said it would take a pandemic to dent global consumption and growth.
"To the degree coronavirus is symptomatic of . . . unknowns in the marketplace, it is way too premature to assess a view around a recession," said Bob Browne, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Corp. "You need to see a marked slowdown in U.S. economic growth."
In one sign investors haven't given up riskier assets, many are holding on to junk bonds. Both Northern Trust and Aviva Investors said they remained in high-yield bonds and that it would take a more severe drop in stocks before reconsidering.
Investors often sell lower-rated debt when they are nervous about the economy.
"The virus is not causing us to change positioning yet," said Kevin Matthews, global head of high yield at Aviva Investors, an asset manager with $440 billion under management.
While analysts haven't dismissed the severity of the virus, some have noted that markets face external stresses such as extreme weather and geopolitical events. The Bank for International Settlements in a recent study said climate-related risks could be a potential source of the next financial crisis, calling them "green swans."

Stocks climbed as investors turned their attention to earnings season and improving economic data.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 187.05 points, or 0.7%, to 28722.85, while the S&P 500 rose 32.61 points, or 1%, to 3276.24, on Tuesday. Both indexes suffered their steepest losses since October on Monday as investors reacted to efforts world-wide to contain a deadly virus outbreak in China.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 130.37 points, or 1.4%, to 9269.68.
The Stoxx Europe 600 gauge gained 0.8%, while exchanges in China and Hong Kong remained closed for the Lunar New Year.
Investors are turning back toward earnings and economics reports, said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial.
"The U.S. economy is in pretty good shape and should be able to withstand the fallout from the coronavirus, should it spiral," he said.
The Commerce Department reported that durable-goods orders rose 2.4% in December, driven by military spending. However, a closely watched measure that excludes aircraft orders and military spending fell 0.9%.
After the closing bell, Apple -- the largest U.S. company -- reported record revenue and a return to profit growth in its latest quarter behind strong sales of iPhones, apps and its AirPod wireless earbuds. Shares climbed 1.3% after hours.
Results from Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon.com are on deck this week.
The outbreak of coronavirus risks further stunting an already slowing Chinese economy. Travelers in recent weeks have carried the infection to other countries, including the U.S., Australia, Germany and Japan.
Investors largely expected a slight uptick in growth this year and are now reaching for safer assets like U.S. government bonds. Rising concern about the potential impact of the Chinese outbreak has led to a flattening of the yield curve.
"If you take China's growth out of the equation, then the basis for your global growth forecast starts to fall apart," said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury briefly slipped below that of the three-month bill before paring declines and rising to 1.642%. When short-term yields exceed longer-term ones, it can be a recession signal.
Tech stocks were the best performers in the S&P 500 ahead of Apple's results, rising 1.9% and nearly erasing Monday's sharp decline.
PulteGroup was the biggest gainer among the stocks in the broad index, climbing $2.54, or 5.7%, to $46.84 after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and a pickup in housing demand.
Xerox Holdings also beat earnings expectations, pushing its shares up $1.73, or 4.9%, to $36.78.
On the losing side, McCormick dropped $6.65, or 3.9%, to $166.06 after the spice company's fourth-quarter revenue missed analysts' expectations and it issued disappointing guidance for 2020.
Harley-Davidson fell $1.05, or 3%, to $33.79 after the motorcycle maker reported earnings and sales that fell short of expectations.
3M slid $10.05, or 5.7%, to $165.58 after the maker of everything from Post-it Notes to molar crowns said it would eliminate 1,500 jobs as part of a broad restructuring effort.
South Korea's Kospi ended Tuesday down 3.1% -- the biggest drop since October 2018. Early Wednesday, the benchmark was up 0.5%. At midday in Tokyo, the Nikkei was up 0.5% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 2.5% on its first trading day after the Lunar New Year.

Coronavirus prompts D.C.-area universities to issue bans, warnings
Students from universities in the Washington area who are studying abroad in China have been told to return home amid the coronavirus outbreak that has left more than 100 people dead and thousands infected.
American University students were told Tuesday to leave Beijing and return to their campus in Northwest Washington 'as soon as possible,' said Jennifer Fei, a junior and international studies major who was studying in the Chinese capital. 
'I think there is a lot of uncertainty right now with how wide-reaching this virus is going to be,' Fei said by email. 'Since so many have traveled for the Lunar New Year, I think it's really difficult to predict how many have been affected or may become affected.'
AU is prohibiting travel to China, said university spokeswoman Kelly Alexander. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned travelers Monday to avoid nonessential trips to China, and Chinese authorities have imposed travel restrictions in the country.
'AU will be working with the students to assist them in arranging accommodation and registration in courses on campus,' Alexander said in an email.
Georgetown University issued a similar warning, said school spokeswoman Meghan Dubyak. Three students studying in Beijing have been asked to leave, and school officials have temporarily banned university-related travel to China.
'While there have been no reported cases with any connection to Georgetown, the university is taking proactive steps to ensure the safety and health of our community out of an abundance of caution, since there is still much about the situation that is unknown,' university officials said in a letter sent to faculty and students.
Coronaviruses belong to a family of viruses that can manifest in illnesses ranging from a garden-variety cold to more serious diseases. The novel coronavirus that authorities believe has emerged in China has caused an outbreak of respiratory illness around the world.
The University of Virginia has responded by advising students to leave their program at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China, and continue their studies remotely, said Brian Coy, a university spokesman. Virginia Tech leaders have told faculty and students to avoid traveling to the country.
'By the luck of the draw, and the way faculty scheduling and course scheduling worked out,' there are not any Virginia Tech students in China, said spokesman Mark Owczarski. But the ban on travel will prevent faculty from attending conferences or conducting research in China, Owczarski said.
Leaders at George Washington University are helping students in China return home. And GWU students who had planned to travel to China in the coming weeks are working with university staff to make other arrangements, said Crystal Nosal, a spokeswoman.
Howard University reported no students currently abroad in China.
At the University of Maryland's flagship campus in College Park, officials have delayed or canceled programs in China.
Several potential coronavirus cases are under investigation in the United States. A George Mason University student is awaiting lab tests to determine whether the student has the virus, the university said in a statement.
Leaders of the school in Northern Virginia said the student does not live on campus and is isolated from others.
'At this time, the current risk to the public and the Mason community remains low, and the university has been advised that additional precautions are not necessary,' officials said. 'The local health department is conducting an investigation and will contact anyone whom they suspect to be at risk of exposure and illness.'
The travel warnings come during a break for students in China " a break that coincides with Lunar New Year, one of China's most significant holidays. AU students studying at Peking University in Beijing were scheduled to return to classes next week, but schools across the country have delayed the first week of classes because of the virus. 
Students who traveled outside Beijing during the break were told they had to be quarantined in an on-campus hotel for two weeks before returning to classes, students said.
Olivia Emery, a 20-year-old AU student studying at Peking University, said the continued spread of the virus has limited her ability to travel. She did not leave Beijing during the break and said she had been 'stuck in [her] off-campus apartment and the surrounding area for three days.'
'I am no longer allowed to attend my internship,' Emery said in an email. 'I must bring hand sanitizer with me everywhere I go. Essentially, I live my life constantly fearing catching the virus.'
When she ventured onto campus Friday, she had to have her temperature taken before being granted access.
Fei, who has family in eastern China, said she is concerned about the people she and her peers will leave behind.
'My family in the States just bought over 10 [respiratory] masks to send to my family in China because they are pretty much impossible to find here now,' Fei said. 'The whole situation is incredibly heartbreaking.'

New reality of lockdown could last weeks, if not longer
BEIJING " In China's Hubei province, authorities are waging a desperate struggle to supply protective equipment, testing kits and hospital beds as the sick pour into clinics and confirmed cases of the new coronavirus mount.
But holed up in apartment blocks across an area the size of Washington state, tens of millions of others who are symptom-free are fending off cabin fever.
Nearly a week into a quarantine of unprecedented scale, as many as 54-million people trapped in Wuhan, the outbreak's center, and the densely populated plains lining the Yangtze River are beginning to adjust to a surreal reality that could last weeks, if not longer.
Transportation services have largely ground to a halt and most businesses are closed. But so far, residents say, food remains relatively well stocked " if more expensive than usual " in supermarkets, and order prevails on the eerily abandoned streets. 
Government officials have ordered Alibaba's Hema chain of grocery stores to remain open, and companies have continued to offer home deliveries of food and supplies. Seven of the country's major courier services say they are rushing in express shipments of medical aid.
State media organs on Monday showed the premier, Li Keqiang, visiting a Wuhan supermarket, where he assured a crowd that the government could keep vegetables flowing in and prices stable.
With most basic necessities within reach " for now " the next looming question for the healthy population: Is this life for the near foreseeable future?
'I don't want to take the risk just yet,' said Zhang Min, 30, a homemaker whose family hasn't ventured out of their 500-square-foot apartment on Zhongshan Road for six days. She plans to continue staying indoors, doing yoga and learning dance moves with her daughter since her pantry is stocked with three days' worth of food, she said.
Around 8 p.m. on Monday, Zhang turned off the lights in her apartment, opened her window and bellowed the national anthem as part of a citywide initiative arranged by neighborhood committees to boost morale.
'It was good to release some pent-up stress,' she said.
Across town, an English teacher named Tang, who spoke on the condition that he be identified only by his surname to discuss political matters, said he was instructed this week by his academy to prepare to teach over the Internet, probably for a long time. All primary and secondary schools in Wuhan would transition to online courses starting Feb. 10, local media reported Tuesday.
Tang said he saw online notices, later scrubbed, that Wuhan would remain under lockdown through April. 
Whatever the case, he said, 'this is going to last much longer. It's the only way we can keep our families safe. There's no other choice.'
Zeng Yulin, another teacher, said Wuhan librarians have been offering books to keep children occupied at home. Banks were even extending mortgage payment deadlines, she said.
'The biggest problem isn't eating. It's not going to work and getting your salary for a month or two,' she said. 'Will people survive that?'
On Chinese social media, holed-up Wuhanites showed how they were coping in videos that quickly went viral. Neighbors exchanged meat for vegetables out of their high-rise windows. Aunties sat around a mah-jongg table placing bets with their prized protective face masks instead of cash. A man in his pajamas sat in front of his living room aquarium dangling a fishing pole.
One poster on the popular Douban forum described bored relatives debating a perennial conspiracy theory in China: whether the viral outbreak was a secret U.S. plot.
'This fight's been going on two hours,' poster 'big island' wrote sarcastically. 'If I knew family dinners were so much fun I wouldn't ever need to go out.'
Some experts argue that the Hubei quarantine " likely to be the largest in world history " may not be necessary or effective, and may instead backfire by stoking public resentment. Indeed, beneath the jokes and memes this week was an undercurrent of frustration about the government. Many Chinese this week logged onto sites streaming the HBO miniseries 'Chernobyl' and left comments drawing a connection between the late-era Soviet Union and a Chinese Communist Party also known for coverups. 
In a state television interview on Monday, Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang apologized to citizens who were angry about the city's lockdown and acknowledged that the government withheld information about the outbreak during its critical early stages. Zhou appeared indirectly to accuse his superiors in the party hierarchy of muzzling him.
'The party secretary above him who hasn't even shown his face yet,' said Tang, the English teacher, referring to the mayor and his superiors. 'What we're seeing now can't be his fault alone. We need the country to hold all these people accountable.'
Chinese officials have foreshadowed the possibility of tough and disruptive isolation measures lasting months " and exacting an enormous toll on the economy and daily life. One of them, the chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control, Zeng Guang, urged Wuhan to brace for a 'protracted war.'
'The virus battle in Wuhan will last longer than SARS,' Zeng wrote Monday on Weibo, referring to the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome that lasted eight months from 2002 to 2003 and was also caused by a coronavirus.
Zeng said the coronavirus's spread may not taper off until warmer weather arrives in spring, but he said the arrival of medical relief teams from across the country should relieve the patient bottleneck.
For many foreigners stranded in Hubei, the prospect of waiting weeks more seemed unbearable. Kashir Javaid, a Pakistani medical student studying at Hubei Polytechnic University in Huangshi, outside Wuhan, said he was trapped on campus along with another 100 other international students from Asia and Africa. 
The university began providing food in the cafeteria Monday, but every other store is closed. The Pakistani Embassy has not responded to his pleas to be evacuated, he said, and some of his classmates are experiencing mental distress.
'It's the tension in the air,' he said. 'The Chinese say we are waiting for good news from our scientists and maybe we can leave February 10, but I don't think they have any way to contain this.'
Back in Wuhan, Coco Zhao, a 21-year old student, said she spent several days holed up in her Hubei University dorm, playing smartphone games, polishing her English and video-chatting with her parents who live 60 miles away in another locked-down city in Hubei province. 
As she emerged Tuesday to buy groceries, Zhao said, she found hundreds of shoppers already queuing at a supermarket at 8:30-a.m. The shop had most foods, but fresh vegetables, masks and hand sanitizer were long sold out.
She worried about the reports of overwhelmed doctors and surging infections, Zhao said, but for now, that seemed to be a distant struggle.
'I'm a little bit worried about my safety,' she said. 'Mostly, I'm just bored.'

Questions still abound on illness's contagiousness, transmission, lethality
China has ordered an unprecedented quarantine of more than 50-million people. It has closed schools and shut down live animal markets. Airports across the globe are screening passengers coming from the world's most populous country.
But three weeks after the new coronavirus emerged as a health crisis, experts can't yet say whether these efforts will succeed at containing an infection that now threatens at least 15 countries. 
Some early signs are discouraging: Six countries, including China, have confirmed human-to-human transmission of the infection. Those include four cases in Germany connected to a single person " a worrisome sign for containment of the disease. Cases in China continue to multiply, and five million residents of Wuhan, where the virus originated, have left the city, some of them surely carrying the disease. 
But so far, the mortality rate is less than the rate of other severe respiratory coronaviruses. In China, where 5,974 people are infected, 132 have died through Tuesday. That is a high rate, but far less than the fatality rate of SARS and MERS. And countries like the United States that quickly began screening travelers, isolating sick people and tracing their contacts have just a handful of cases. There have been no fatalities outside China. 
Public health officials said Tuesday that they are grappling with a long list of unknowns that will determine how successful they are in limiting the toll of the widening outbreak. Those questions include how lethal the virus may be, how contagious it is, whether it is transmitted by people who are infected but show no symptoms, and whether it can be largely contained in its country of origin.
'It is very striking how quickly the numbers are going up,' said Trish Perl, chief of infectious diseases and geographic medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center, who has fought other respiratory virus outbreaks, including SARS and MERS. 
'As the numbers are going up, do I think I'm concerned about the rapidity of it? Yes,' Perl said. 'Do I think it may be difficult to control? Yes. But in the context of a lot of unknowns.'
Experts are not sure whether the rise in new cases means the virus is now widely circulating in China, or whether the Chinese are doing a better job of surveillance and testing, or both.
U.S. health officials held a news conference Tuesday to reassure a wary public that, for now, virtually no one here is in imminent danger.
'Americans should know that this is a potentially very serious public health threat, but, at this point, Americans should not worry for their own safety,' said Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar.
The new virus is not nearly as infectious as the measles virus, which can live as long as two hours in the air after an infected person coughs or sneezes, and it is not comparable to the threat posed by the seasonal flu, which has killed at least 8,200 people in the United States so far this season. 
But Azar also acknowledged, 'We don't yet know everything we need to know about this virus.'
China agreed Tuesday to allow a World Health Organization team of experts into the country to study the coronavirus, officials of the U.N. agency said after a meeting between the organization's director general and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
'The two sides agreed that WHO will send international experts to visit China as soon as possible to work with Chinese counterparts on increasing understanding of the outbreak to guide global response efforts,' the statement said. 
It was unclear whether the team would include experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But several nations continued to pursue or consider evacuating their citizens from Wuhan, including France, South Korea, Morocco, Britain, Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and Russia. 
In the Philippines, immigration authorities temporarily suspended the issuance of visas for Chinese nationals upon arrival. Immigration commissioner Jaime Morente said the move was designed 'to slow down the influx of group tours' and prevent the spread of the virus.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced dramatic measures to stem the flow of mainland Chinese into the territory, including the closure of railways, ferries and cross-border tour buses. Flights to mainland China will be slashed by half, and the Hong Kong government will stop issuing individual travel visas to mainland Chinese, starting Thursday.
Yet for all the action taken, even the near future remains uncertain.
'There is a real possibility that this virus will not be able to be contained,' said former CDC director Tom Frieden, who oversaw the responses to the Ebola and Zika outbreaks.
Researchers are struggling to accurately model the outbreak and predict how it might unfold, in part because the data released by Chinese authorities is incomplete. China has shared information showing when cases were reported, but not when people became ill. 
Researchers also want to know more about the incubation period, currently estimated at two to 14 days, and how severe most cases are.
The virus's fatality rate is just over two percent, if figures posted by the Chinese government are accurate. That is considerably lower than death rates from the respiratory coronaviruses that caused SARS, which killed nearly 10 percent of people infected, and MERS, which killed about 35 percent. 
Some experts are encouraged that no case outside China seems to be severe. and that no fatalities have been recorded outside China so far.
Others cautioned that the current death rate may mean little because the most severe cases in an epidemic like this one often emerge early, when sick people present themselves to health-care providers, then become fewer as public health measures are instituted and medical care is strengthened.
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, noted in an interview that the virus may have been spreading unnoticed for weeks in Wuhan before it emerged into public view. 
If many people had mild symptoms, it would have been easy to miss them, and that made it harder to put control measures in place, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
Experts also are unsure whether asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus. China's health minister Ma Xiaowei alarmed officials around the world this weekend when he said his government had evidence that this type of spread was occurring.
But U.S. officials have challenged that conclusion, saying they have not seen data that prove it and want the Chinese to show them. And asymptomatic patients never drive more than a small percentage of infections in epidemics such as this one, Fauci said.
'Even if there some asymptomatic transmission, in all the history of respiratory-borne viruses of any type, asymptomatic transmission has never been the driver of outbreaks,' he said. 'The driver of outbreaks is always a symptomatic person.' 
At the moment, U.S. officials are isolating coronavirus patients in the hospital. But that may not be practical if there are many more cases. During SARS, highly infectious patients known as 'super spreaders' were responsible for the virus's rapid spread in health-care facilities.
It makes more sense to isolate someone with a mild coronavirus illness at home, said Nuzzo, the Hopkins expert. 'If somebody only has a fever and runny nose, is there a need to freak out?' she said.

Virus Outbreak Disrupts Global Car Makers in China; Analysts warn the outbreak could further slow down China's auto sector if consumers postpone car purchases

The coronavirus outbreak, which has all but sealed off China's Hubei province from the rest of the world, could have an outsize impact on the global auto industry, which has a large footprint in the region in central China.
The virus's spread has disrupted some car manufacturing in China and prompted major auto companies with operations there to restrict travel and ask employees to stay home. One German auto supplier said Tuesday that at least five employees had been infected.
The Chinese auto industry has grown from virtually nothing 30 years ago to become the world's largest market for new vehicles, surpassing the U.S. in 2009. Wuhan, Hubei's capital and the believed source of the outbreak, has in that period emerged as an auto-making hub, home to state-owned Chinese car manufacturer Dongfeng Motor Corp. and numerous assembly plants building cars for Honda Motor Co., PSA Group and General Motors Co.
Analysts say it is still far too soon to estimate the potential damage to the auto industry from the outbreak, but pointed out that the short-term impact of the SARS outbreak in China in 2003 is a poor comparison, because China's car market at the time was much smaller.
While China's car sales have boomed for much of the past decade, consumer demand there has begun to taper off. Industrywide sales fell for a second year in a row last year, and analysts warn that should the outbreak become more severe it could further hurt the auto sector.
"The outbreak could cause vehicle purchases to be put on hold in the coming months, taking the market down further. Manufacturers may reduce planned output levels when it becomes clearer how the market has reacted to the crisis," said David Leggett, an automotive editor at GlobalData, an auto analytics firm.
Auto makers in Wuhan are expected to produce 1.6 million vehicles this year, contributing 6% of overall Chinese output, according to IHS Markit data, cited by Credit Suisse in an investor note Tuesday.
Honda said Tuesday it wasn't sure when its three joint-venture vehicle plants in Wuhan would reopen in light of the epidemic, and it postponed the reopening of two motorcycle plants outside the Wuhan region. The three Wuhan factories, which make models such as the CR-V sport-utility vehicle and Civic sedan, together have the capability to build 600,000 vehicles a year—nearly half of Honda's total capacity in China.
Honda said about 30 Japanese employees and families living in Wuhan would return home on a plane chartered by the Japanese government and set to land in Japan early Wednesday. A few Honda employees will stay in Wuhan, the company said. Nissan Motor Co. said it also has some Japanese employees and their families participating in the evacuation.
France's PSA Group and the Nissan-Renault alliance produce a smaller number of cars in Wuhan, according to Credit Suisse. A PSA spokesman said its China factories are closed for the Lunar New Year holiday and the company isn't allowing employee travel to China.
GM, which operates a car factory in Wuhan with joint-venture partner SAIC, said the plant has been idle since Jan. 24 for the holiday, and workers are tentatively scheduled to return Monday. The plant produces four models for the Chinese market, contributing about 19% of GM's total China production, according to Credit Suisse.
The European auto industry, which builds millions of vehicles in China and has dozens of plants and tens of thousands of employees there, was on high alert as the first European cases of the coronavirus infections surfaced in Germany this week.
Webasto SE, an auto-parts supplier based in Bavaria, confirmed Tuesday that four employees in Germany had contracted the virus after an employee from China visited headquarters in Stockdorf last week.
The company said a medical team was screening anyone who had come into contact with those infected. The headquarters is closed and employees who work there are barred from traveling until Feb. 2. Employees in China have a two-week travel ban. Webasto has 11 facilities in China, including in Wuhan.
Other car manufacturers say they are taking precautions, such as restricting travel involving China and asking employees there and those returning from the country to stay home.
Audi, BMW and Daimler didn't comment on questions about the impact on production and distribution of vehicles in China, where logistics have been heavily affected by travel bans.
Volkswagen AG, by far the largest foreign auto maker in China, producing around four million vehicles a year there, urged employees to refrain from any nonessential travel to China.
The German auto maker is urging roughly 3,500 employees in Beijing to work from home for two weeks after the Lunar New Year, as the coronavirus continues to spread. Its China subsidiary has suspended international and domestic business travel until further notice.
Ford Motor Co.'s China subsidiary, Ford China, which has plants in the neighboring province of Chongqing, said it would extend a holiday break at its factories for the Lunar New Year celebration through this coming weekend and is reviewing whether to postpone normal business operations to Feb. 10.

Louis Vuitton's Dip Doesn't Herald End of Luxury Boom; Sales growth weakened in the luxury company's latest quarterly results, but it isn't a sign of serious trouble just yet

Louis Vuitton's owner reported its weakest quarterly sales growth in three years, but the business of luxury seems to be experiencing temporary bumps rather than a long-feared downturn.
LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the luxury-goods giant owned by the world's second-wealthiest man, Bernard Arnault, said late Tuesday that revenue increased by 8% in the three months through December after stripping out the impact of exchange-rate moves and portfolio changes. The quarterly growth rate was LVMH's slowest since late 2016.
As one of the first companies in the luxury business to report this quarterly earnings season, LVMH's results will be scrutinized for any slowdown in spending by wealthy Chinese shoppers who now buy one-third of all such goods globally. So far, demand for designer handbags and clothing hasn't been impacted by slower economic growth in China or by political protests in Hong Kong .
That should reassure investors worried that the luxury-goods sector's three-year winning streak might be coming to an end. LVMH's sales in Japan fell by 4% in the fourth quarter from the year-ago period, but this was due to an increase to value-added tax that incentivized shoppers to make their purchases in the third quarter before the new levy came into effect.
Slippage at LVMH's wine-and-spirits division also may prove temporary. Retailers in the U.S. spent heavily on Hennessy in the third quarter when the Trump administration threatened to put trade tariffs on a range of European imports related to a disagreement with Brussels over aircraft subsidies. Although French cognac eventually escaped any levies, the higher Hennessy inventories now held by retailers will take some time to work through.
Still, the sector's long run leaves it more prone to disappointment given high valuations. As a multiple of projected earnings, listed European luxury companies now trade at a 70% premium to the MSCI Europe index compared with their 45% average over the past decade, according to analysts at UBS.
The bumps aren't over: The emergence of a deadly coronavirus in China is likely to be another temporary blow to designer brands. At the time of the 2003 SARS outbreak, Chinese consumers were buying less than 10% of all luxury goods sold world-wide. Most brands have more than tripled their exposure to China's wealthy shoppers since then.
The luxury sector's spectacular rally will eventually come to an end, but LVMH hasn't been the one to break the spell for now.

LVMH Sales Powered by Fashion, Leather Goods; French luxury-goods conglomerate's revenue climbs 15%

PARIS—LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE reported record results last year, driven by strong growth at the fashion houses Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior.
Revenue rose 15% to €53.67 billion ($59.17 billion) and net profit 13% to €7.17 billion, both record highs. All divisions grew, led by fashion and leather goods—including Louis Vuitton and Dior—where revenue surged 20%. The results were in line with analysts' expectations.
LVMH is the world's largest luxury-goods company, and its results are considered a bellwether of the industry as a whole. But the Paris-based conglomerate in recent years has outperformed most of its competitors, gaining market share.
Louis Vuitton is the world's best-selling luxury brand. LVMH also owns the Italian jeweler Bulgari, cosmetics retailer Sephora, cognac maker Hennessy and dozens of other brands.
It struck a deal last year to buy the American jeweler Tiffany &Co., making LVMH the world's largest jeweler.
The company has powered through protests in Hong Kong for much of the year, relying on its geographic diversification to serve clients who are avoiding the city, long a magnet for luxury shoppers.
Sales in Hong Kong fell sharply in the fourth quarter but had little impact on the group's overall performance.
The year capped a decade of uninterrupted revenue growth at LVMH, each year setting a new record high for the group. While sales have been buoyed by some acquisitions—Bulgari in 2011, the ready-to-wear division of Dior in 2017 and the luxury hotel chain Belmond last year—most of the increase is due to sales growth at brands the group already owned, in particular Louis Vuitton.
The period saw LVMH ride a wave of demand for luxury goods from Chinese shoppers, who travel the world to shop at the conglomerate's boutiques. But now LVMH and other luxury companies face the threat of the coronavirus in China , where the government has quarantined Wuhan, the outbreak's epicenter. The virus has thrown Chinese consumers' travel plans into turmoil just as the shopping season of the Lunar New Year has arrived. Chinese shoppers are the luxury industry's most important clientele, representing more than a third of global sales, according to consulting firm Bain &Co.
Bernard Arnault, the chief executive and controlling shareholder of LVMH, said he has asked his teams in China about the impact of the outbreak.
"It's very early to have an answer," Mr. Arnault said Tuesday, speaking to reporters and analysts.
If the consequences of the outbreak are felt through March, "that wouldn't be terrible," he said. "If it lasts two years, that would be another story."
Growth slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter, reflecting tax issues in Japan and unrest in Hong Kong. Hennessy also sold cognac to distributors ahead of the winter holiday season in the third quarter—earlier than normal—lowering sales in the fourth quarter. The company also wrote off stock of some smaller cosmetic brands in the U.S.

Virus Outbreak Disrupts Global Car Makers in China; Analysts warn the outbreak could further slow down China's auto sector if consumers postpone car purchases

The coronavirus outbreak, which has all but sealed off China's Hubei province from the rest of the world, could have an outsize impact on the global auto industry, which has a large footprint in the region in central China.
The virus's spread has disrupted some car manufacturing in China and prompted major auto companies with operations there to restrict travel and ask employees to stay home. One German auto supplier said Tuesday that at least five employees had been infected.
The Chinese auto industry has grown from virtually nothing 30 years ago to become the world's largest market for new vehicles, surpassing the U.S. in 2009. Wuhan, Hubei's capital and the believed source of the outbreak, has in that period emerged as an auto-making hub, home to state-owned Chinese car manufacturer Dongfeng Motor Corp. and numerous assembly plants building cars for Honda Motor Co., PSA Group and General Motors Co.
Analysts say it is still far too soon to estimate the potential damage to the auto industry from the outbreak, but pointed out that the short-term impact of the SARS outbreak in China in 2003 is a poor comparison, because China's car market at the time was much smaller.
While China's car sales have boomed for much of the past decade, consumer demand there has begun to taper off. Industrywide sales fell for a second year in a row last year, and analysts warn that should the outbreak become more severe it could further hurt the auto sector.
"The outbreak could cause vehicle purchases to be put on hold in the coming months, taking the market down further. Manufacturers may reduce planned output levels when it becomes clearer how the market has reacted to the crisis," said David Leggett, an automotive editor at GlobalData, an auto analytics firm.
Auto makers in Wuhan are expected to produce 1.6 million vehicles this year, contributing 6% of overall Chinese output, according to IHS Markit data, cited by Credit Suisse in an investor note Tuesday.
Honda said Tuesday it wasn't sure when its three joint-venture vehicle plants in Wuhan would reopen in light of the epidemic, and it postponed the reopening of two motorcycle plants outside the Wuhan region. The three Wuhan factories, which make models such as the CR-V sport-utility vehicle and Civic sedan, together have the capability to build 600,000 vehicles a year—nearly half of Honda's total capacity in China.
Honda said about 30 Japanese employees and families living in Wuhan would return home on a plane chartered by the Japanese government and set to land in Japan early Wednesday. A few Honda employees will stay in Wuhan, the company said. Nissan Motor Co. said it also has some Japanese employees and their families participating in the evacuation.
France's PSA Group and the Nissan-Renault alliance produce a smaller number of cars in Wuhan, according to Credit Suisse. A PSA spokesman said its China factories are closed for the Lunar New Year holiday and the company isn't allowing employee travel to China.
GM, which operates a car factory in Wuhan with joint-venture partner SAIC, said the plant has been idle since Jan. 24 for the holiday, and workers are tentatively scheduled to return Monday. The plant produces four models for the Chinese market, contributing about 19% of GM's total China production, according to Credit Suisse.
The European auto industry, which builds millions of vehicles in China and has dozens of plants and tens of thousands of employees there, was on high alert as the first European cases of the coronavirus infections surfaced in Germany this week.
Webasto SE, an auto-parts supplier based in Bavaria, confirmed Tuesday that four employees in Germany had contracted the virus after an employee from China visited headquarters in Stockdorf last week.
The company said a medical team was screening anyone who had come into contact with those infected. The headquarters is closed and employees who work there are barred from traveling until Feb. 2. Employees in China have a two-week travel ban. Webasto has 11 facilities in China, including in Wuhan.
Other car manufacturers say they are taking precautions, such as restricting travel involving China and asking employees there and those returning from the country to stay home.
Audi, BMW and Daimler didn't comment on questions about the impact on production and distribution of vehicles in China, where logistics have been heavily affected by travel bans.
Volkswagen AG, by far the largest foreign auto maker in China, producing around four million vehicles a year there, urged employees to refrain from any nonessential travel to China.
The German auto maker is urging roughly 3,500 employees in Beijing to work from home for two weeks after the Lunar New Year, as the coronavirus continues to spread. Its China subsidiary has suspended international and domestic business travel until further notice.
Ford Motor Co.'s China subsidiary, Ford China, which has plants in the neighboring province of Chongqing, said it would extend a holiday break at its factories for the Lunar New Year celebration through this coming weekend and is reviewing whether to postpone normal business operations to Feb. 10.

Why Capex Can't Catch a Break; December's durable goods orders showed that capital spending remains anemic

FULL TEXT
One-off issues keep getting in the way of a capital spending revival. It is time to ask if those issues aren't the real problem.
The Commerce Department on Tuesday reported that monthly orders for durable goods—long-lasting items ranging from sheet metal to motors— rose 2.4% in December . But that gain came about as a result of a 90% increase in orders for defense goods. Excluding that volatile category, orders fell 2.5%.
Nondefense aircraft and parts orders fell 75%, reflecting Boeing's continued travails with its 737 MAX. Nondefense capital goods orders excluding aircraft—a category that economists view as a good proxy for the forthcoming trend in capital spending—slipped 0.9%.
All of this suggests that the slump in business investment that began last year will likely continue into the opening months of 2020. Indeed, matters could get worse before they get better as a result of Boeing's decision to halt production of the 737 MAX this month and worries that the coronavirus outbreak in China could dent the global economy .
It seems like capital spending just can't catch a break. Boeing's worsening woes, trade troubles, soft overseas growth and the General Motors' strike were among the hurdles it faced last year. Now, just as easing trade tensions and forecasts of better global growth suggested there would be a break in the clouds, here come a fresh set of issues.
But just as with a basketball team blaming this or that coach or player for its dismal record, excuses for why capital spending isn't picking up risk wearing a little thin. If companies were given an overwhelming reason to start spending more, they probably would.
Instead, they have been presented by a U.S. economy that, while steady, has been only growing at about a 2% annual rate. Moreover, rising labor costs have been pressuring profit margins. The combination of tepid growth and an unemployment rate at a 50-year low clearly is unusual.
While it is true that over the longer run, increased capital spending would eventually help boost productivity and alleviate labor costs, companies tend not to step up capital spending when earnings growth is weak, as it has been for the past year. In an environment where growth is only moderate while unemployment is extremely low, companies' default position is to play it safe.
Eventually, capital spending should still improve. The problem is that "eventually" could take a while to arrive.

United Technologies Profit Rises as Break-Up Looms; Conglomerate expects Boeing MAX problems to hurt aerospace unit

United Technologies Corp. posted higher fourth-quarter profit and sales while warning that Boeing Co.'s problems with its 737 MAX airliner will hurt results in its Collins Aerospace business.
The conglomerate's cash flow came in stronger than expected by Wall Street, largely because of timing around the costs of various deals as the company works toward breaking up .
UTC recently got needed tax rulings in the U.S. and Canada and expects the spinoff of two major businesses in early April, followed shortly by the closing of its merger with Raytheon Co .
"Everything is on track here at UTC," said Neil Mitchell, acting chief financial officer, in an interview Tuesday. "We are delivering strong financial results at the same time as executing several items in the coming months."
UTC is spinning off its Carrier business, which makes heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, and Otis, its elevator and escalator manufacturing division. The businesses are already operating in an independent manner, the company said Tuesday.
The two divisions, to be separate public companies, are planning to present financial outlooks to investors in February. UTC will provide a more in-depth 2020 outlook after the Raytheon deal, the company said. Executives said Tuesday's results are likely the last reported by United Technologies; the new company will be called Raytheon Technologies.
The deals, which still haven't received all their needed regulatory approvals, are the culmination of years of moves by Chief Executive Greg Hayes, who previously sold major pieces of UTC and struck a deal for Rockwell Collins in late 2018. Mr. Hayes will stay on as CEO of Raytheon Technologies.
For the fourth quarter, UTC posted net income of $1.14 billion, or $1.32 a share, up from $686 million, or 83 cents a share, in the prior year, with much of the change coming from lower tax costs. The company reported $19.55 billion in sales, compared with $18.04 billion in the year-ago period.
UTC reported free cash flow of $6.6 billion in 2019, ahead of a previous projection of $5.2 billion to $5.7 billion, but said much of the boost came from timing. The company expected $1 billion in breakup costs but only recorded $400 million in the last quarter. It expects $1.6 billion in related costs in the first quarter, Mr. Mitchell said, because of tax payments and the refinancing of debt for Otis and Carrier.
UTC said Tuesday it expects sales in its Collins Aerospace division to fall in the low single digits in 2020, hurt partially by suspended production of Boeing's 737 MAX. UTC is also expecting Collins' adjusted operating profit to decline by up to $375 million because of the MAX.
The company is assuming a roughly 90-day production delay for the MAX, Mr. Hayes said on a conference call, telling investors that the timeline is consistent with guidance from Boeing. The fourth quarter didn't see much fallout from Boeing's issues, Mr. Hayes said, because of support from the additional aftermarket work on other aircraft that remain flying at airlines.
"We have been in constant contact with Boeing," Mr. Hayes said, noting that UTC doesn't expect to cut jobs during the Boeing halt because of the relatively short timeline and the scarcity of good aerospace workers. "This is our best guess of what that production pause will look like."
Boeing hasn't said how long it expects the MAX line to be stopped .
Mr. Hayes also said that UTC expects a "blip" in first-quarter air traffic activity in Asia because of the continuing coronavirus outbreak but doesn't anticipate much of an impact on its own aftermarket business.
In analyzing the possible effects from the virus, UTC looked at the SARS outbreak in 2003, which slowed air traffic for three months and cut the overall aftermarket business by 20% for two quarters, Mr. Hayes said.

U.S. Stocks Close Higher Amid Global Efforts to Contain Virus; U.S. yield curve briefly inverts amid investors' concerns about virus's impact on global growth

U.S. stocks climbed Tuesday as investors turned their attention to earnings season and improving economic data, though bond markets briefly flashed a recession signal for the first time since October.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 187.05 points, or 0.7%, to 28722.85, while the S&P 500 rose 32.61 points, or 1%, to 3276.24. Both indexes suffered their steepest losses since October on Monday as investors reacted to efforts world-wide to contain a deadly virus outbreak in China.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 130.37 points, or 1.4%, to 9269.68.
The Stoxx Europe 600 gauge gained 0.8%, while exchanges in China and Hong Kong remained closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.
The coronavirus is obviously serious, but investors are turning back toward earnings and economics reports, said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial.
"The U.S. economy is in pretty good shape and should be able to withstand the fallout from the coronavirus, should it spiral," he said.
After the closing bell, Apple—the largest U.S. company—reported record revenue and a return to profit growth in its latest quarter behind strong sales of iPhones, apps and its AirPod wireless earbuds. Shares climbed 2.6% after hours.
Results from Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon.com are on deck later this week.
The outbreak of coronavirus, which has killed more than 100 people and infected over 4,500 in China, risks further stunting an already slowing Chinese economy, which is increasingly important for global growth . Travelers in recent weeks have carried the infection to other countries including the U.S., Australia, Germany and Japan.
Investors were largely expecting a slight uptick in growth this year and are now reaching for safer assets like U.S. government bonds. Rising concern about the potential impact of the Chinese outbreak has led to a flattening of the yield curve.
"If you take China's growth out the equation, then the basis for your global growth forecast starts to fall apart," said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury briefly slipped below that of the three-month bill, before paring back declines and then rising to 1.642%. The three-month U.S. government debt is currently at about 1.560%.
When longer-dated debt offers smaller returns than bonds with shorter maturities, it can be an indicator of fixed-income investors' growing concern about the economy. Still, the yield curve can invert a number of times before the start of a recession: last year, markets went on to largely shrug off the event.
Among equities, McCormick dropped $6.65, or 3.9% to $166.06 after the spice company's fourth-quarter revenue missed analysts' expectations and it issued disappointing guidance for 2020. Harley-Davidson fell $1.05, or 3%, to $33.79 after the motorcycle maker reported earnings and sales that fell short of expectations.
3M slid $10.05, or 5.7%, to $165.58 after the maker of everything from Post-it Notes to molar crowns said it would eliminate 1,500 jobs as part of a broad restructuring effort.
Over in Asia, South Korea's Kospi index ended Tuesday down 3.1%—the biggest drop since October 2018—after markets in the country resumed trading following the Lunar New Year holiday. The retreat was led by declines in tourism and technology stocks.
Major exchanges in Hong Kong are scheduled to open Wednesday, while bourses on the mainland will be closed until next week after Chinese authorities extended the holiday in a bid to curtail mass migration and contain the virus.
On the economic front, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that durable-goods orders rose 2.4% in December, driven by defense spending. However, a key measure that excludes aircraft orders and defense spending fell 0.9%.

Investors around the globe stepped up their retreat from stocks and many commodities, reflecting intensifying fears that a viral outbreak in China will deliver a setback to the outlook for world economic growth.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its fifth consecutive daily decline, dropping 453.93 points, or 1.6%. The S&P 500 also declined 1.6%, its first drop of more than 1% since October.
Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.605%, its lowest level since October, a signal investors are eschewing risk as they reconsider an outlook that just recently had been brightening.
The Cboe Volatility Index, which measures expected moves in the S&P 500 index, also climbed to its highest level since October.
"It's probably too early to determine the impact to global growth from the outbreak of this virus," said Allen Bond, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management. "The impact on global growth is probably the key uncertainty."
Concern about the coronavirus intensified as the tally of infections jumped over the weekend.
The virus has infected more than 4,500 people and killed at least 106, mostly in China's Hubei province. It has spread to other countries including the U.S., Japan and South Korea, and public-health officials have warned that it is growing more contagious.
Shares of tourism-related companies and those with ties to China were among the hardest hit, after the country imposed travel restrictions in response to the outbreak.
Wynn Resorts, which has a large presence in gambling hot spot Macau, declined 8.1%. American Airlines Group, one of the world's largest carriers, dropped 5.5%, and Apple, which counts China among its biggest markets, fell 2.9%.
The selloff jolted an equity market that had been unusually calm: The S&P 500 hadn't logged a daily rise or fall of more than 1% since October. It also hadn't suffered two consecutive daily declines since Dec. 10.
The broad stock-market index fell 51.84 points to 3243.63, weighed down by losses in all 11 sectors. The energy, technology and materials sectors, all of which are sensitive to China and any growth-related fears, dropped more than 2%.
The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, gave up its gains for the year, falling to 28535.80, less than 0.1% below the level at which it ended 2019. And the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 175.60 points, or 1.9% -- its largest one-day decline since August -- to 9139.31.
"Clearly, the news today is just hit the sell button first and worry about the details later," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital.
U.S. stocks have steadily risen since mid-October when the Trump administration indicated it was nearing a phase-one trade deal with Beijing. Meanwhile, improving economic data -- and three interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve -- eased fears about a manufacturing slowdown bleeding into the broader economy.
Shares have been trading at relatively high multiples of earnings, which has made them more vulnerable to pullbacks in response to negative headlines, said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at INTL FCStone.
"Investors were considering and really looking forward to improved global growth," he said. "Uncertainty like this causes people to step back and reassess the amount of risk they're taking."
As investors fled stocks, they sought safety in gold, which rose 0.4%, settling at the highest value since April 2013.
Making the matter more difficult to assess for investors is the fluid nature of the outbreak and the impenetrability of Chinese politics. The mayor of Wuhan said rules imposed by Beijing limit what he could disclose about the threat posed by the pathogen, suggesting the government was partially responsible for a lack of transparency about the outbreak.
In addition to developments around the virus, investors are looking ahead to a big week of corporate earnings reports. Among the companies on tap for Tuesday are Apple, Pfizer and Lockheed Martin.
With about 17% of S&P 500 companies having reported for the fourth quarter, 70% have topped analysts' earnings expectations, according to FactSet.
Still, analysts anticipate earnings for the S&P 500 as a whole to register a drop of 1.9% from a year earlier, before climbing again in the first quarter of 2020.
Investors also will be keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve's meeting Wednesday, though the central bank is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady.
Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 retreated 2.3%. Markets in China, Hong Kong and South Korea were closed Monday for a public holiday. Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed down 2% on Monday and at midday was down 0.9%.
In the U.S., hotel, cruise and airline stocks were among the biggest decliners on the day. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning to avoid nonessential travel to the Hubei province of China.
Las Vegas Sands dropped $4.58, or 6.8%, to $63.27 and MGM Resorts International lost $1.22, or 3.9%, to $30.35.
United Airlines Holdings shares fell $4.27, or 5.2%, to $77.63 and Delta Air Lines shares declined $1.98, or 3.4%, to $56.83.
With renewed questions about growth in China, the world's largest consumer of industrial commodities, shares of mining company Freeport-McMoRan fell 94 cents, or 7.9%, to $10.90.
Oil prices slumped, extending their losing streak to five sessions, as the virus outbreak threatens to damp economic growth in China, the world's biggest energy consumer. Brent crude, the global benchmark, declined 2.3% to settle at $59.32 a barrel, the lowest mark since Oct. 21.

Investors had been forecasting a relatively calm earnings season. They could instead be caught off-guard with bigger-than-expected swings.
Fears about the coronavirus broke the sleepy stretch in markets, with stocks and crude oil falling Monday as the detection of infected patients in the U.S., Australia and France fanned worries about its economic impact.
Options prices indicate investors weren't projecting the big moves in individual stocks that sometimes characterize corporate-earnings season. Stocks in the S&P 500 were expected as of Friday to swing about 3.8% on average in the trading session following their reports. That is the lowest projected move since the third quarter of 2017, according to data compiled by UBS Group AG.
Through Friday, the S&P 500 hadn't moved up or down 1% in a single session since mid-October, one of its longest such streaks since the end of 1969. Over the same period, the index climbed 11%, notching 28 records along the way. The equity gauge snapped this streak Monday.
Options activity tied to the S&P 500 index also picked up Friday and Monday, according to data provider Trade Alert. U.S. stocks had risen in recent weeks and market volatility had been low, leaving some investors vulnerable to the recent snapback in turbulence.
The record run halted late last week as fears about the virus percolated through markets. Stocks fell on Friday and the declines continued early Monday, with stock futures falling overnight and major indexes dropping shortly after the opening bell.
On Monday, the S&P 500 fell 1.6%. The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, jumped to 18.23, its highest close since early October.
The declines come as a busy week of earnings kicks off. Investors will be poring over results from bellwether companies such as McDonald's Corp. and Caterpillar Inc. that tend to provide clues on the health of the economy, as well as technology heavyweights like Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.
Concerns about the virus also appeared on some earnings calls. Joe Moeller, chief operating officer of Procter &Gamble Co., said on Thursday's earnings call that he is tracking the recent coronavirus because of its potential implications across China's borders.
"It can also affect consumer confidence in large parts of the market," he said. "It can affect travel, which does affect our business, and so it's one of the many pieces of volatility that's just important we keep in front of us as we think about the prospects for the future."
The worries about the virus come after some recent earnings releases have encouraged investors about the health of the domestic economy. Several big U.S. banks recently impressed investors with their earnings, showing that the U.S. consumer continues to spend, a bullish sign for the current economic expansion.
Intel Corp. posted earnings that beat estimates and gave an upbeat outlook for the year. Its stock surged 8.1% Friday, closing at the highest level since September 2000. It fell 4.1% Monday. American Express Co.'s latest profit also beat Wall Street's expectations, and the company sounded an upbeat note for 2020. Its shares rose 2.9% Friday even as the broader market declined, but shares fell 3.3% Monday.
Additionally, companies have a low bar to clear this period. Overall, analysts are expecting profits to slide 2.1% for the fourth quarter from a year earlier, FactSet data show. Growth is expected to resume after that, accelerating to about 10% by the third quarter of 2020.
The low expectations could be good news for investors because they set companies up to beat their targets, potentially giving stocks a lift in coming weeks. About 69% of the companies that have reported earnings so far have surprised investors with stronger-than-expected earnings, according to FactSet, with many more results pouring in this week and next. About 68% of companies beat revenue expectations. Analysts tend to be fairly conservative with their estimates, making earnings beats common.
"I'm really positive on what we're likely to see," said Sarah Henry, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management.
Still, the tame expectations could cause investors to be caught off-guard by results that are worse than expected -- and spark a slide in stock prices. The volatility in markets on Monday is in contrast to what many were expecting this season.
Although the U.S. consumer has powered the economy for the past decade, many investors are watching for signs that people will slow their pace of spending. Within the S&P 500, options investors are bracing for some of the biggest moves for shares of consumer-discretionary companies, the UBS data through Friday showed.
"The market is thus not expecting large moves on earnings," said Stuart Kaiser, head of equity derivatives research at UBS. "The part of the market they're more concerned about is consumer-facing."
The sector includes household names such as Harley-Davidson Inc. and Starbucks Corp. -- both on tap to report this week -- and retail heavyweights like Nordstrom Inc., companies whose fortunes tend to rely on the health of the American shopper. Tesla Inc. is also poised to report on Wednesday after rallying 33% this year, testing investors' affection for highflying technology companies.

World News: Hundreds of Americans Prepare to Flee Wuhan

SHANGHAI -- Hundreds of Americans were preparing to fly out of Wuhan, bound for California, as fears grew at the epicenter of China's health crisis. But more U.S. citizens aren't leaving, having failed to secure a seat on the single U.S.-bound flight -- or decided to ride out the emergency.
A State Department evacuation flight promised relief for a segment of Wuhan's roughly 1,000 Americans, as a lockdown triggered by a coronavirus outbreak turned the focus to the dangers of contagion and a long quarantine in China's eighth-most-populous city. Roads, restaurants and many shops in Wuhan are shut as China tries to contain the virus.
A U.S. charter jet was expected to arrive Tuesday at Wuhan's closed airport and quickly depart for the U.S., ferrying 230 or so U.S. diplomats, their family members and an "extremely limited" number of private citizens back to the U.S., according to a State Department notice and passengers who have been in contact with the U.S. Embassy in China.
The plane will land in Ontario, Calif., a city about one hour east of Los Angeles, a State Department spokeswoman said Monday. She added that all travelers would be screened for symptoms before departing.
During a refueling stop in Anchorage, passengers will disembark into a terminal closed to the general public and receive another health screening before continuing on to California, said Anne Zink, Alaska's chief medical officer. Medics will be on the flight, Dr. Zink said.
Vermont native Priscilla Dickie, 35 years old, and her 8-year-old daughter have seats -- but she wasn't sure how she would get to the airport, around 20 miles away, with almost all Wuhan transportation shut down.
Benjamin Wilson is hunkering down. Mr. Wilson, who is from Louisiana and father to a 7-year-old girl, is married to a Wuhan native. The plane wasn't taking Chinese nationals.
Some Americans said that remaining in Wuhan with loved ones seemed like a safer prospect than getting on an aircraft full of people who could be sick or carrying the virus -- and who are expecting to face quarantine once they land in the U.S.
"As of right now, my dad is adamant about staying where he is," said a Brandeis University student who had failed to coax her father back from Wuhan after he flew there for business. "He's worried about getting sick from people on the plane and potentially bringing it back to us."
Mr. Wilson is doing his best to keep his family safe. When he steps outdoors in Wuhan, he wears gloves, a rain jacket and pants on top of his clothing, and a mask over his mouth. He touches as little as possible and is buying only food wrapped in plastic. When he returns home, he wipes everything down in antibacterial soap. The mask goes in the trash.

Treasurys Gain on China Concerns

U.S. government bond yields dropped to their lowest levels in months Monday, spurred by investors' flight to safer assets as they grappled with the spread of the deadly coronavirus.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 1.605%, the lowest close since Oct. 9, compared with 1.680% Friday.
Yields, which fall when bond prices rise, extended recent declines after Chinese health officials said the coronavirus was becoming more contagious, having already killed dozens of people, most of them in China's Hubei province.
Though its potential economic impact remains unclear, the spread of the coronavirus has stirred memories of the 2002 outbreak of SARS, caused by a similar virus that studies showed slowed the Chinese economy while killing 774 people.
In the bond market, the virus has upended a monthslong period of calm that had left the 10-year yield drifting between roughly 1.8% and 1.9%. Treasurys tend to attract investors during times of economic or political uncertainty because they offer a steady stream of income with essentially no risk of default.
While investors entered 2020 in a relatively optimistic mood, the spreading virus has exacerbated concerns that the global economy -- which grew last year at the slowest rate since the financial crisis -- remains on fragile footing and could be knocked off course by unexpected shocks.
"We're not starting off at a good point, and when you have the second largest economy in the world facing a big slump, that does not bode well for the rest of the globe," said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of fixed-income trading at D.A. Davidson &Co.
As it stands, the 10-year yield remains comfortably above the lows below 1.5% reached last summer. Those came before the U.S. and China started making progress toward a preliminary trade agreement that helped ease investors' recession fears, pushing yields higher.
But the yield also has dropped well below the roughly 1.93% level that it briefly reached in December. And the gap between longer-term and shorter-term yields has also shrunk, in a sign that investors are becoming less enthusiastic about the economic outlook.
At Monday's close, the 10-year note yielded 0.162 percentage point more than the two-year note, down from 0.350 percentage point at the end of last year, according to Tradeweb.
Adding to investors' concerns on Monday was data showing that new U.S. home sales dropped 0.4% from the previous month. That was well below the 1.5% gain that economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had anticipated.

Market Decline Threatens Predictions for Calm Earnings Season; Options investors have expected the smallest post-earnings-reports move since 2017, but they may be underestimating shares' swings

Although fears about global growth re-emerged last week because of the viral outbreak , such worries had abated in recent months. The International Monetary Fund recently said the global economy is poised for a modest rebound in 2020, fueled by easier monetary policy and a trade truce between the U.S. and China.
As a result, investors and analysts have grown more optimistic about stocks' recent record run. Some have raised their outlooks for the S&P 500 in 2020 after the broad stock-market gauge started the new year on a strong footing, though the index gave up much of its gains Monday. It is now up just 0.4%.
Wells Fargo Investment Institute said last week that it expects the S&P 500 to jump to as high as 3520 by year-end, about a 7% increase from its prior 3300 target. It closed Monday at 3243.63.
"We see easing trade tensions, firming global growth expectations and continued central-bank monetary support world-wide as the main positive contributors to stronger sentiment and moderately higher valuations," the strategists wrote.

CHINA BRACES AS VIRUS MUTES DEMAND; With consumers, workers and travelers sidelined, Beijing fears a slowdown in economic growth.

China's leaders are bracing for a blow to first-quarter economic growth as the deadly coronavirus weighs on consumption, travel and manufacturing, with the Lunar New Year break extended until next week.
The virus, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has led authorities to cancel events across the country for the normally weeklong holiday period, which started on Saturday.
As of Monday, the coronavirus had killed at least 81 people and infected more than 2,800, leading authorities to impose a lockdown on a population of about 40 million around Wuhan in Hubei province.
The financial capital Shanghai has ordered companies not to reopen until Feb. 10, while the manufacturing hub of Suzhou has postponed the return to work of millions of migrant laborers for up to a week. Suzhou is one of the world's largest manufacturing hubs, where companies such as iPhone contractor Foxconn, Johnson &Johnson and Samsung Electronics have factories.
Underscoring concern among policymakers over the economic fallout from the outbreak, China's banking and insurance regulator announced moves to help businesses affected by the crisis.
Companies would receive support "through measures such as encouraging appropriate lowering of loan interest rates, improving arrangements for loan renewal policies and increasing medium-term and credit loans," the China Banking Regulatory Commission said.
Brent crude oil, the international standard, dropped $1.37 to close at $59.32 a barrel, the first time this year it has traded below $60, after authorities warned that the spread of the virus would accelerate.
The timing of the outbreak has presented a twofold threat for leaders in Beijing, who are under global pressure to manage the crisis in a transparent and timely manner.
Not only has the outbreak hit during the Chinese New Year, when people make billions of trips to visit family, but it comes as the country is reporting its lowest rate of economic growth in nearly 30 years.
For President Xi Jinping, the crisis represents another challenge on top of the popular uprising in Hong Kong, the swine fever outbreak that has wiped out millions of pigs and fueled inflation, and the trade war with the U.S. The toll on travel from the coronavirus outbreak has become evident in statistics released by the government on Sunday.
Railway transport on Saturday, the first day of the Lunar New Year, fell about 42% compared with the same day last year, according to the transport ministry. Passenger flights were down roughly 42% and overall transport across the country declined about 29%.
"The timing could not have been worse as hundreds of millions of Chinese are returning home for family reunions or are on leisure travel ahead [of] and during the Chinese New Year," said Priyanka Kishore of Oxford Economics.
Ctrip, China's largest online travel group, said on Monday it had asked global travel operators to refund passengers who wished to change their travel plans.
"The coronavirus makes a pronounced slowdown even more likely and if the disease is not brought under control quickly, then even our downbeat forecasts may turn out to be too high," said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
Retail sales and tourism are the first areas expected to be affected.
The east gate of Beijing's Forbidden City is a popular destination for holidaymakers during the Lunar New Year. But on Sunday, the second day of the traditional festival, the area was quiet.
"It's normally very busy at this time of year but the outbreak has stopped people from coming," said an employee at a souvenir shop in the area. She noted with a hint of optimism that this outbreak would pass and tourism in the area would recover, just as it did after the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, adding: "Just wait until it gets warmer."
SARS, which killed nearly 800 people, knocked quarterly economic growth down by 2 percentage points, from 11.1% in the first quarter of 2003 to 9.1% in the second quarter.
Economists said China's economy has changed since SARS. "The big trend in 2003 was that China's economy was at an early stage of an export upcycle when SARS broke out," Macquarie China economist Larry Hu said in a note. Despite SARS, exports grew 35% year over year in 2003.
In 2019, the economy grew by just 6.1%. Exports over the last two years have been hurt by the trade war with the US. Consumption, which is now under pressure from the outbreak, has become a far more important source of stable economic growth for the country.
"Everything depends on how rapidly it spreads and how serious it gets, but in principle this could have a serious impact on consumption," said Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University and senior fellow at Carnegie-Tsinghua Center. "People are not going out to restaurants and bars."
But economic policy makers will have less room to tinker with fiscal policy this time around, compared with the SARS outbreak.
"After the SARS epidemic, China adopted an expansionary fiscal policy including tax cuts to help with the recovery of the sectors most affected," Tianlei Huang, an analyst at the Peterson Institute of International Economics, wrote in a note. "Today China is running large fiscal deficits and thus has less room to apply fiscal stimulus as it did last time."

Stocks Are on Course for Biggest Move Since October; The current 70-day streak is the longest period without a 1% move by the S&amp;P 500 since then

Volatility is back in the stock market.
The S&P 500 was off 1.2% at midday Monday. A loss of that size would break a streak of 70 consecutive sessions, dating to October, in which the index hasn't closed up or down more than 1%.
A stretch of tranquility that long is rare. The current streak is the longest period without a 1% move since the 74 trading days ended Oct. 9, 2018, according to research from Dow Jones Markets Data. It currently ranks as the fifth-longest stretch since 1969.
The rapid spread of the coronavirus over the past week has shattered the market's calm.
"This is an important one," said Frank Cappelleri, executive director at brokerage Instinet, of the streak. "It's been on a lot of radar screens."
What's notable about the streak, he said, isn't just that the market hadn't fallen by more than 1%. The lack of 1% gains is just as notable, because the two together showed just how quiet the market has been. Monday's selloff could, he said, be the proverbial floodgates opening, the end of that easy market, especially coming on the heels of last week's selling.
"Emotion is back and you're probably going to see that on both sides of the tape until a new pattern develops," he said.
The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, which measures expected moves in the S&P 500 index, climbed on Monday to its highest level since the start of this year.
The selling was widespread, with every sector in the S&P 500 falling, but some stocks, such as airlines, resort operators and other travel-related companies, were hit worse than others.
Shares of Las Vegas Sands Corp., which operates a casino and hotel in Macau, the semiautonomous Chinese city, slid 6%. The U.S. Global Jets ETF, which tracks the performance of the global airline industry, lost 3.1%, while Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. fell 2.9%. Shares of energy companies are also sliding, pressured by falling oil prices. Marathon Petroleum fell 2.5%.
Another streak that could be broken with Monday's selloff: The S&P 500 is on track to post back-to-back declines for the first time since Dec. 10. The 29-trading-day streak without consecutive declines through Thursday is the longest such stretch since mid-November, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
The virus's impact on the global economy is still difficult to predict, leading many investors to ask: Why are people so quick to sell?
"The one trend that's undefeated is human nature," Mr. Cappelleri said. "It's as much about that as any data point."

World News: Outbreak Keeps Chinese Shoppers From Spending

SHANGHAI -- China was counting on consumers to underpin its already slowing economy. Now, authorities are advising people to stay home, and many residents are too frightened anyway to eat out, shop, see movies or travel as a deadly virus passes person to person.
Anxiety may be spreading faster than the coronavirus that emerged from the central Chinese city of Wuhan in recent weeks. That adds risks to what was already expected to be a very challenging year for the economy in China.
Many services core to China's consumer boom are grinding to a halt as people forgo plans to spend money during the country's biggest annual holiday, the Lunar New Year that began Saturday. Local authorities in some parts of China have ordered theaters, museums and other venues to shut down. Wuhan halted public transportation in, out and around the city, and more than a dozen other cities in central China have since followed suit.
Beijing resident Fang Yin said she is bracing for a boring holiday after canceling plans to travel to Nanjing. "We have nowhere to go, not even to see a movie," she said.
Her caution -- multiplied nationwide as the contagious pneumonia has spread to virtually every province in China -- threatens to set back a vibrant Chinese consumer sector, which had been a source of optimism for big American brands like Nike Inc. and IMAX Corp. The companies didn't immediately respond to a request to comment.
"China's economic growth was already struggling before the outbreak, and such a public health crisis threatens to drag growth even lower," said Chen Gong, a U.S.-based economist who has advised city governments in China.
Even before the coronavirus emerged, the economy appeared poised to expand more slowly than 2019's rate of 6.1%, a nearly three-decade low.
If the outbreak doesn't stabilize by March, China's economic growth might fall below 6% in the first quarter, according to French bank Societe Generale SA, which has forecast 6.1% growth. Economists generally believe that a growth rate of 6% this year is psychologically important because it would enable Beijing's leaders to reach a politically important goal of doubling the size of the economy from 2010 levels.
The consumer sector took an economic hit when severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, swept across China and into other countries from booming southern China in late 2002 and early 2003, killing hundreds of people.
Today, consumer spending makes up a bigger share of the economy, said Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank. Official numbers put consumer activity at just over half the total economy. When SARS hit, China's economy hinged far more on big-ticket government-led investment.
Even so, China's growth slowed to 9.1% in the second quarter of 2003 when SARS peaked -- down from an 11.1% growth rate in the first quarter. The country hadn't yet built a high-speed rail network or many subway systems that spur consumer activity but are suddenly sources of anxiety about places to get infected. But China also didn't have an online economy, which makes it easy to consume from home.
The current coronavirus outbreak could cost more than 40 billion yuan ($5.77 billion), which would shave about 1 percentage point off China's 2020 growth rate, according to the economist Mr. Chen, who based his estimate on a preliminary assessment of the situation and a comparison with the impact from SARS.
Some sectors are set to be hit especially hard. China's movie business typically does nearly one-tenth of its $9 billion-plus annual box office during the weeklong holiday. Seven film premieres are canceled, including "Leap," a biopic starring Gong Li as the coach of the national volleyball team that was expected to fare especially well.
Shanghai Disneyland, meanwhile, closed on Friday and offered refunds to ticket holders. Crowds were so thin at the city's normally packed mock Chinese city, Yu Gardens, that one young family thought it was a safe place to stroll. "Here, there's hardly anyone, not like normally," said Zhao Lei, the mother of two restless children.
How long the outbreak lasts will determine whether other economic drivers, such as factory production, are also affected.
Big cities including Beijing and Shanghai said schools will remain closed at least through Feb. 17, and some through the end of February.
For Wuhan, an economic engine of central China and now the world's largest quarantine zone, the damage is likely to be especially severe. The city is a transportation hub roughly four hours by train from Beijing and Shanghai.
It hosts factories for some of the world's largest car makers including General Motors Co., as well as the brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev SA. Economists with ANZ said that if the weeklong holiday disruption is extended further by the epidemic, that could drag on Wuhan's overall industrial production.

Three people in California and Arizona were diagnosed Sunday with the coronavirus that has led to the lockdown of several cities in China, bringing the total U.S. cases of the illness to five.
Health authorities in Orange County and Los Angeles County in California, and Maricopa County in Arizona, confirmed cases of the virus there. All had recently traveled to Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus originated, health authorities said.
The news came hours after U.S. State Department officials said they would evacuate a planeload of diplomats and other U.S. citizens to San Francisco from Wuhan, which is under quarantine.
The new cases and announcement of the arrival of passengers from Wuhan added to growing concern about the virus in the U.S. It has sickened approximately 2,700 people and killed 80 as of Sunday, most of them in Wuhan and surrounding Chinese province of Hubei.
In the U.S., roughly 100 people in 26 states have been investigated for or are currently under monitoring for the virus, after showing potential symptoms.
At least 25 were negative for the virus. The other two confirmed cases were in Chicago and Washington state. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it expects more potential cases in the coming days, but that the overall risk to the general public is low.
The chartered plane from Wuhan to San Francisco is due to take off Tuesday. Anthony Nguyen, duty manager at San Francisco International Airport, said Sunday he didn't know if it would land there or at a private airfield.
The CDC has been screening passengers for the virus there, as well as at New York's Kennedy International, Los Angeles International, Chicago O'Hare International and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International airports.
The CDC hasn't yet said whether the Wuhan passengers will be quarantined once they arrive.
The expanding outbreak sparked worries at schools and universities across the country with exchange programs with China.
Some are setting up monitoring systems, isolating suspected cases, or notifying the community that there is little chance the virus will show up on campus.
Some have large international student populations from China as well as faculty who travel abroad.
For the 10th consecutive year, China remained the largest source of international students in the U.S. in the 2018-19 academic year with 369,548 college and university students, according to the Institute of International Education.
A student at Wesleyan University in Middleton, Conn., who was potentially exposed to the virus is in isolation awaiting a CDC test, even though a preliminary test shows the student has the flu, university spokeswoman Renell Wynn said. Students at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, and Tennessee Technical University underwent testing for the virus based on symptoms and travel history. Test results came back Friday negative for the Tennessee Tech student, officials said.
At the University of Wisconsin Platteville, six students arrived on campus on Jan. 21 who had recently been in Wuhan. None of the students have shown signs of the coronavirus, but university officials said they are taking their temperatures on a regular basis as a precaution.
Longfellow Middle School in Fairfax, Va., scaled back an exchange program beginning this month involving 21 students and five chaperones from China after concerns from parents, a spokeswoman said. The visiting students will no longer attend the school, but will participate in other cultural events.

THE DAY IN SPORTS; Watt helps AFC beat NFC in Pro Bowl

Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt returned a fumble 82 yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, and the AFC defeated the NFC 38-33 in the Pro Bowl on Sunday at Orlando, Fla.
Jacksonville Jaguars lineman Calais Campbell sacked the Minnesota Vikings' Kirk Cousins on fourth and goal from the nine and stripped the ball, which Watt scooped up.
It was the fourth consecutive victory for the AFC.
The NFC had a chance to rally late and tried to take advantage of a new rule that allows the scoring team to retain possession by facing a fourth-and-15 play from its 25. Cousins threw a deep ball that Baltimore Ravens safety Earl Thomas intercepted.
Campbell was selected the AFC's defensive player of the game. Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson was the MVP on offense.
Jackson threw for 185 yards and two touchdowns. Deshaun Watson of the Houston Texans threw for 148 yards and a touchdown.
Ryan Tannehill of the Tennessee Titans connected with Jacksonville's DJ Chark for a 60-yard touchdown pass in which officials opted not to rule him down after two defenders touched him.
Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson gave his NFC starting spot to the New Orleans Saints' Drew Brees, who is contemplating retirement.
Cousins, Brees and Wilson threw touchdown passes.
The NFC's top highlight was Philadelphia Eagles tackle Fletcher Cox rumbling 61 yards for a score. Minnesota safety Harrison Smith intercepted a pass from Watson at the three-yard line and returned it to the 39 before lateraling to Cox, who took it the rest of the way.
No one tried to tackle the 310-pound Cox. Denver Broncos receiver Courtland Sutton slapped at the ball for the final 20 yards.
"I'm glad nobody did try to stop me," Cox said. "It was fun. I was looking for somebody to pitch the ball to, though. Guarantee I was. Get this thing out of my hands."

Two men were fatally shot in separate incidents Sunday in Washington, police said. 
In one case, D.C. police said Andy Bonilla, 19, of Northwest was shot a few minutes before 1-p.m. in the 2900 block of Sherman Avenue NW. He died at a hospital.
More than an hour later, police said Eric Delonte Barbour, 36, of Southwest was found wounded about 2:15 p.m. in the unit block of N Street SW. He died at a hospital, police said.
No information was available about suspects or a motive in either case.

THE REGIONPossible coronavirus cases are investigated 
Virginia health officials are monitoring three people who may be infected with the coronavirus, state health officials said Sunday.
The Virginia Department of Health said in a statement that the three people " one in the northern region of the state, and two in central Virginia " meet criteria for suspected exposure to the newly identified virus that emerged last month from Wuhan, China.
The investigation will determine whether their symptoms are caused by the new coronavirus or another respiratory ailment, the department said. 
The agency did not provide more specifics, citing the patients' privacy. 
Health officials in the United States say five cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the country.
The Virginia Department of Health has created a page on its website that it says will provide periodic updates on the number of suspected cases in the state.

A mix of festivities and face masks at Lunar New Year parade

The Lunar New Year parade felt different to Stephanie Cheng this year.
For one thing, there were a lot more face masks. Standing in a hallway at the Chinatown Community Cultural Center, where she serves as executive director, Cheng said she saw many men and women " among the large crowds gathered downtown Sunday afternoon " walking around with their noses and mouths obscured.
The center itself purchased 40 light purple surgical masks, Cheng said, and stocked up on hand-sanitizer 'just in case.' But it was too little avail, she acknowledged, because far fewer people than usual showed up to eat the center's popcorn, watch its New Year's performances or try their hand at Chinese calligraphy. 
'I don't know if the coronavirus is why they stayed away, but maybe,' Cheng said. 
The virus, a mysterious pneumonia-like illness that emerged in China's Wuhan region in late 2019, has claimed at least 80 lives in China, triggering emergency health measures and spurring global panic. As cases surge worldwide " in places including France, Japan and Taiwan " the United States confirmed its fifth infection this weekend. 
The outbreak came just a few days before the Lunar New Year festival, the most important holiday on the Chinese calendar. Beijing and other large Chinese cities canceled their celebrations in a bid to help contain the virus.
In the District, the parade went on. As Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) led the way, dancing dragons, children spinning Chinese yo-yos and a man dressed as a panda marched down H Street NW to the beat of snare drums and the cry of red vuvuzelas, inspiring cheers and selfies " some featuring face masks. 
Changdae Kim struggled to stay focused on the festivities. As he sold tickets to upcoming events behind a table in the community center, his thoughts drifted to his girlfriend, who is earning a business degree in China. 
A week ago, after reading about the coronavirus online, Kim, a Korean American resident of the District, broached the topic during the couple's daily FaceTime call. He told his girlfriend to stay inside, and she said she would, promising to stock up on food.
Kim, 28, asks her regularly for updates about the virus. Though his girlfriend lives far from Wuhan, everyone around her is freaking out, she's told him. Whenever someone offers surgical masks for sale online, she said, the masks are gone within minutes.
'She's constantly afraid about it,' Kim said. 
As he puffed on a cigar and eyed passing parade-goers, Kit Lee said he also fears for loved ones in China. Relatives on both his mother's and father's sides of the family still live in the country, Lee said, though none are near Wuhan.
Lee, a 51-year-old Fairfax resident, emigrated from China in 1979. His mother, who also immigrated to the United States, called her family in China on Sunday morning. All are healthy and coronavirus-free so far, Lee said " and all of them vowed never to go outside without face masks.
Halfway around the world, Lee's son is following a similar doctrine.
Brandon Lee first learned about the coronavirus during AP Biology class at Falls Church High School last week, he said. The lesson lingered. Biting into chasu bao " a golden-brown bun filled with pork " on Sunday, the 17-year-old pointed to his pocket. 
'I've got a mask right here,' he said, 'and I'm putting it on the minute I finish eating this.'
Others took different precautions.
Sue Hsu, 73, and her daughter Susan Hsu, 40, were determined to bring Susan's 2-year-old son to see the special New Year's parade. But they weren't taking any chances: They bundled the boy behind a blockade of blankets in his blue stroller and packed extra wet wipes. Thirty minutes into the parade, Sue had already wiped her grandson down once.
'I'm worried,' said Sue, who is Taiwanese American and has relatives in Taiwan. 'I watch YouTube news clips about the virus every day.'
Still, some displayed little concern about germs, coronaviral or otherwise. 
Midway through the parade, children danced through the streets, flinging handfuls of plastic-wrapped fortune cookies into the air. A little girl in a long red coat picked one off the pavement and offered it to a police officer.
He looked around. Then he took it.

Virus Sparks Soul-Searching Over China's Wild Animal Trade; Beijing faces uncomfortable questions over its failure to clean up wildlife trade and public calls for a permanent ban on wild meat

BEIJING—It didn't take long to identify the suspected source of a deadly coronavirus outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan: a cluster of vendors in a downtown market offering carcasses and live specimens of dozens of wild animals—from bamboo rats to ostriches, baby crocodiles and hedgehogs.
The Huanan food market, a scruffy complex of 1,000 stalls spread over an area the size of nine football fields, is the largest of its kind in central China, mostly supplying seafood to Wuhan's residents and restaurants. It is typical of the wet markets where most people in this country buy their food.
Like many such markets, it also sold wild animals enjoyed as culinary delicacies or used as traditional medicine—an ancient trade Beijing has continued to allow despite warnings that it caused a deadly coronavirus outbreak almost two decades ago, and could trigger another global epidemic .
After giving Huanan market an all-clear during inspections late last year, city officials have now closed it. When Wall Street Journal reporters visited this past week, it was cordoned off by police tape and stall holders were lining up in the rain to receive compensation and Lunar New Year handouts.
Racing to contain the outbreak , China's national authorities have locked down Wuhan and several other cities in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. On Sunday, they imposed a temporary nationwide ban on the trade of wild animals and quarantined all wildlife breeding centers.
Even so, Beijing now faces uncomfortable questions over its failure to clean up the wildlife trade in recent years. It is also confronting unusual public calls in China for a permanent ban on wild meat, something it has been reluctant to impose for fear of angering its relatively wealthy aficionados.
China's president, Xi Jinping, has spoken about the country's ability to show leadership on global issues, such as public health. And his response to the current crisis is likely to be seen as an important test , health experts and political analysts say.
"This incident should be used as an opportunity to rectify the chaos" in China's wildlife trade, said a petition published on Thursday by 19 prominent Chinese scientists, including a former head of Peking University.

Medical researchers have determined that the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or SARS, that started in 2002 originated in bats and spread to humans via palm civets—cat-sized mammals that look a bit like weasels—sold in Chinese food markets.
Studies have shown that SARS-type coronaviruses reside naturally in bats but can easily jump to other hosts , mutating along the way, especially in markets where species, including humans, mingle.
Although Chinese authorities have yet to identify the precise origin of the current outbreak, a study released on Thursday by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, based on patient samples, found a 96% genetic match with a bat coronavirus.
Another Chinese study suggested snakes sold in the market were the source, although other scientists think it less likely the virus jumped between reptiles and mammals.
"This is a wildlife-origin virus—it's pretty clear," said Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization that has been studying the origins of SARS and related viruses in China for 15 years.
"Probably bats are the origin from looking at the virus itself, and it got from bats into people in the wildlife market," he said. "This is absolutely déjà vu all over again from SARS."
China is a hot spot for such outbreaks because it combines large bat populations with densely populated rural areas and a long tradition of eating wildlife, especially in the southern provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi.
"Why do I eat it? It is delicious," said Terry Gao, a 30-year-old businessman from Guangxi, where he usually eats wild meat. He said he had a particular taste for civets.
"It is really hard to describe," he said. "Like how lamb has that special taste, civets are the same. Just the flavor of the meat itself. You don't need to cook it in any special way: Once you taste it, you'll know it's civet."
He said he had long known of the health risks, and would avoid eating wild meat during the current outbreak but attributed the problem to poor regulation rather than consumer demand.
Since SARS, China has vastly improved its capacity to respond to disease outbreaks, health experts say. It has also improved hygiene at wet markets, and sought to encourage licensed trade in wild animals bred on farms where they must undergo sanitary checks.
And yet regulation of wildlife farms and markets has been lax. As a result, an underground trade has thrived, with restaurants often commissioning wild meat—including endangered species—from hunters via middlemen, researchers and wildlife activists say.
Online trading has also made it easier to source and distribute wild meat across China, and to import creatures such as pangolins from other countries, exacerbating the risk of infections spreading over longer distances.
Two men from the eastern province of Jiangxi, known as the Huanong Brothers, have even become video-streaming stars in China by posting clips from the farm where they breed bamboo rats for their meat, as well as from their regular trips to hunt for wild animals.
"If China doesn't take action on this now, I fear this is just going to happen again," said Zhou Jinfeng, head of the nongovernmental China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation.
Mr. Zhou, who has filed official complaints about wildlife markets all around China, estimated that there were hundreds in the country, with at least one in every major city like Wuhan, and more still online.
"The authorities just don't take any notice," he said. "They think it's good for the local economy."
China banned all wildlife trade in 2003, when Hong Kong researchers first identified civets as a potential source of SARS, but it lifted the ban later that year on 54 species—including civets—that it said could be bred in licensed farms, subject to sanitation checks.
Guangdong province banned the breeding and sale of civets in 2004, but they continued to be traded there and in other provinces. On Thursday, Guangdong imposed a total ban on wild-animal trading.
The central government, however, was slower to respond. First the agriculture ministry ordered a halt Friday to the trade only of wild animals that can carry the coronavirus, which it said included badgers and bamboo rats. Two days later, the State Administration of Market Regulation announced a ban on all wildlife trade but said it would end once the outbreak was over.
The Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, usually focused on fighting corruption, also made an unusual appeal for people to stop eating wild meat in a posting on its website in recent days.
"We must respect the laws of nature and promote scientific and healthy eating habits," it said.
The market at the epicenter of the current outbreak, officially known as the Wuhan Huanan Seafood Wholesale market, was home to vendors selling a wide range of wild meat.
One of them, called Dazhong Livestock and Game, boasted that it could provide more than 100 wild animals, freshly slaughtered or flash frozen, on site or via home delivery, according to a price list published online.
Among the most expensive items were a live ostrich for 4,000 yuan (about $580) and a small live deer for 6,000 yuan. The list also included baby crocodiles, wolves and hedgehogs. The owner couldn't be reached for comment.
The Wuhan Market Regulation Administration inspected the market in November and December but found nothing wrong, according to documents published on its website. It didn't respond to a request for comment.
In September, local officials also inspected some eight stalls selling wild animals and checked their business licenses but found nothing illegal, according to the website of a newspaper run by Wuhan's Communist Party committee.
In a rare admission for a senior Chinese official, Wuhan's mayor, Zhou Xianwang, told the official Xinhua News Agency that local authorities had failed to properly regulate the market—one of 400 in the city.
The first signs of the outbreak came on Dec. 29, when four workers at the market were admitted to a Wuhan hospital with pneumonia.
The hospital alerted the local center for disease control, and Wuhan authorities closed the market on Jan. 1. Health officials took specimens from the site and found evidence of the virus in 33 out of 585 samples, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, or CCDC.
The virus had been found not just in people's bodies, but on wild meat stalls, Gao Fu, the CCDC director told Chinese state television on Thursday.
"We must thus call on everyone not to eat wild animals," he said. "It is only a matter of time to find out which is the specific animal."
James T. Areddy and Shan Li in Wuhan, Qianwei Zhang and Xiao Xiao in Beijing, and Yifan Wang in Singapore contributed to this article.

Momentum Indicators Help Preserve Stock-Market Rally; Central-bank actions to stabilize growth and an initial U.S.-China trade accord are driving steady advance that has been hard to bet against

Indicators of market momentum are coalescing with improving economic data to support the recent stock-market rally, creating a promising backdrop that some investors expect to help major indexes rebound from last week's declines.
Concerns about an outbreak of the new coronavirus in China sent the S&P 500 down nearly 1% Friday. But recent actions by central banks around the world to stabilize growth with lower borrowing costs and an initial U.S.-China trade accord are driving a steady advance that has been hard to bet against.
The percentage of stocks in the S&P that are trading above a closely watched long-term trend line recently neared a peak from two years ago, as did the number hitting their highest level in the past year.
After stocks surged last year despite stagnant earnings, investors this week will be monitoring another batch of fourth-quarter results and projections. Apple Inc., which neared a $1.4 trillion market cap last week and has helped power major indexes higher, releases its results Tuesday. Fast-food giant McDonald's Corp., telecom firm AT&T Inc. and heavy-machinery maker Caterpillar Inc. are also on deck.
Although shares of companies sensitive to travel fell sharply last week, other stocks across sectors extended 2020 gains, particularly following upbeat earnings reports. The group of big gainers included chip maker Intel Corp., credit-card firm American Express Co. and home builder Lennar Corp.
Also contributing to the positive mood: steady flows into passive funds tracking stocks.
"It's just pointless to go against momentum," said Didier Anthamatten, a senior portfolio manager at asset manager Unigestion, which holds a larger position in stocks than the benchmark it tracks. "I just want to go with it as long as the flow is there."
Still, "a small noise could start an avalanche" if there is a swift unwind of bullish wagers, Mr. Anthamatten said.
One such trigger he cited was the deadly coronavirus that is disrupting travel and threatening economic growth in Asia . The S&P 500 ended the week 1% below its Jan. 17 record. It is still up 9.5% in the past three months and has set 26 records since the start of November with worries about a slowdown in global growth fading.
"The highly most likely outcome is we have a relatively benign economic environment in 2020," Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO David Solomon said on the company's latest earnings call.
Goldman shares are up nearly 5.2% so far in January, catching up to many peers and the broader market over the past 12 months. The stock had been under pressure over the company's role in a Malaysian corruption scandal involving the government fund known as 1MDB.
Although most sectors have rallied to start the year, safer assets such as bonds and gold have also, a sign of investor caution.
"We've had this level of skepticism that's still there," said Steven Violin, a portfolio manager at F.L.Putnam Investment Management. "That's a powerful reason to stay the course to some extent."
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How are you adjusting to a buoyant market? Are you preparing for a correction? If so, why? Join the conversation below.
Analysts on Thursday will be parsing fourth-quarter U.S. economic growth figures and expect the slow but sturdy expansion to continue chugging along this year. As overseas economic data improve, many are hopeful corporate profits will rebound as well. Citigroup Economic Surprise Indexes for the U.S., eurozone and emerging markets have risen in tandem lately. All three gauges are now positive, indicating that economic figures are generally coming in better than expected.
And last week, the International Monetary Fund predicted that global gross domestic product will expand by 3.3% this year, up from the 2.9% pace in 2019 that marked the slowest growth in a decade.
Economists are waiting to see when the Federal Reserve might adjust interest rates next after three cuts last year . The central bank's first statement of the year is due on Wednesday, and its careful statements about when it might raise them again and purchases of Treasurys to ease strains in money markets have supported stocks.
"Global monetary policy just keeps driving the market," said Nancy Perez, senior portfolio manager at Boston Private, which has maintained investments in stocks in line with the benchmark it tracks. "I think they're going to err on the side of caution."
One catalyst that could upend the recent period of calm is political uncertainty ahead of the presidential election. But for now, many say it is too early to forecast how the outlook for growth might shift.
"This year is different…We're going to see more tendency for the markets to wait and see," said Nela Richardson, an investment strategist at Edward Jones. "A lot of that is attributable to the election."

Vaping health crisis is hurting our youths 
In September, the Tribune published a letter to the editor ("Don't rush to judgment on vaping," Sept. 23) that urged the public to slow down in passing judgment on vaping until more evidence became available. As a practicing pediatrician in Chicago, I believe the growing body of data cannot be ignored. This is a pressing public health crisis for our communities, particularly our youth.
The notion that e-cigarettes are not the cigarettes of your grandfather's generation is a fallacy as dangerous as the marketing techniques employed. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that two-thirds of users, ages 15 to 24, are unaware that a particular e-cigarette product always contains nicotine, a substance that is both highly addictive and disruptive to brain development into one's early 20s. E-cigs perpetuate nicotine addiction due to higher concentrations: One pod contains as much nicotine as a pack of 20 regular cigarettes.
Counting since summer, the CDC identified 2,668 hospitalized cases of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injuries (EVALI) across all 50 states, with 15% of afflicted people under the age of 18. This lung inflammation -- linked to vaping nicotine, THC or some combination of the two along with vitamin E acetate -- has claimed 60 lives. Although the exact mechanism remains unknown, academic researchers hypothesize the heated oil disrupts normal lung function, impacts immune cells and promotes tumor growth factors. Research takes time, but even these preliminary results over such a brief time are astonishing.
Flavors like mint and mango and the misperception of safety have engaged young tobacco users following two decades of declines in the youth cigarette smoking rate. With looming pressure for a national flavor ban, Juul, the largest flavored pod manufacturer, independently discontinued most flavored pods. Although President Donald Trump was poised to act on one of the most crucial public health crises of our time, his administration backed off of a strict, full ban on flavored e-cigs. The suggested purchasing age of 21 is beneficial; however, the lack of a universal flavor ban allows for the enticement of nicotine-naive individuals and their introduction to dangerous health risks.
-- Dr. Amy Schlegel, Chicago 
Antibiotic misuse must be stopped
Regarding "Antibiotics failed, but old remedy worked" (Jan 2): The story about Minnesota man John Haverty highlights the urgent threat that antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses to public health. His story ends well, but for thousands of others with drug-resistant infections, that isn't the case.
Alternative therapies, such as phage treatment, are crucial in the fight against bacterial resistance. However, this should not divert attention from the careless practices that led to such widespread resistance, namely the overuse of antibiotics.
Despite public health warnings, many meat producers continue to misuse medically important antibiotics to compensate for industrial farming conditions, which has only exacerbated antibiotic resistance. And sales of medically important antibiotics to the beef and pork industries increased last year.
At a time when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates at least one person dies from a drug-resistant infection every 15 minutes, it is crucial to place restrictions on the reckless overuse of antibiotics in industrial farming and ensure the drugs are used to treat only sick animals.
Failure to do so will fuel the spread of drug-resistant bacteria, leaving future generations defenseless against common bacterial infections.

How a new virus can quickly spread
I am an American citizen who was in Wuhan from Dec. 15 to 17. I spent hours at the airport twice and met with many large groups of students and parents. (I recruit students globally.) When I returned to my home in Bangkok on Dec. 23, I had the worst flu I've had in decades. I also visited Beijing on Dec. 20, and my colleague there got the same flu, three days after me. My girlfriend in Bangkok too. We were all in bed with fever, body aches, headaches and lung infections. We all recovered.
I believe I contracted the Wuhan flu before the coronavirus was announced and passed it on to close contacts. My guess is millions have been exposed and many have become sick, but the death rate is low, and like me, our immune systems beat it.
Consider this -- I was in eight major airports in 10 days (Dec. 14-23), twice in Wuhan, Guangzhou, Beijing and Bangkok. In today's world, things like this will be impossible to contain. Because of people like me.
-- John Dohrmann, Bangkok

As petulant Republicans pouted like partisan putzes during the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, pathetically pandering to one pouty person in particular, an outbreak of a new virus prompted possible pandemic panic, and the Doomsday Clock predictably pressed closer to midnight. It all left me hiding under the bed, teeth chattering, mind puzzling over the question: "What the (BLEEP) just happened?" 
Impeachment trial and polls shows Fox News/reality rift: With national polls showing upward of 70% of Americans want to hear from witnesses during the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, Republican lawmakers scoffed and generally behaved like churlish layabouts as the trial got underway.
Putting party over country and public opinion, the Republican Senators voted again and again to deny Democratic calls for witnesses and documents. Some even walked out during opening arguments Wednesday, in violation of the very trial rules they supported.
At one point, reporters noticed Sen. Rand Paul working on a crossword puzzle. A couple GOP lawmakers left the trial to do interviews on Fox News.
Despite an oath of impartiality, it was clear most if not all Republican senators have decided their loyalty to Trump trumps any desire to hear testimony or see evidence, even if that evidence might be exculpatory.
While the Democratic House impeachment managers presented their case in rich, sober detail, even using clips of some GOP senators that showed how far those senators have drifted from integrity, the Republicans offered little more than eye rolls and long-since-debunked excuses.
And the president? On Wednesday, the first day of the trial, he sent 142 tweets and retweets.
Because that's what calm, innocent people do, apparently.
Chinese coronavirus arrives in Chicago: If the swift erosion of Democratic norms and the seemingly bottomless corruption of the Trump administration has you down, here's an unwelcome change of topic.
Following an outbreak of a new and mysterious respiratory virus in China, a number of U.S. airports -- including O'Hare International -- began screening travelers coming from the city of Wuhan, China.
On Friday, the Chicago Department of Public Health reported that a Chicago woman in her 60s who returned from a visit to China earlier this month is the second person in the United States diagnosed with the coronavirus, which has killed at least 26 people. About 830 have been infected, most in China. The first U.S. case of the virus showed up in Washington after a man in his 30s returned from the Wuhan area. That man is hospitalized in good condition and the Chicago woman is hospitalized in stable condition.
The scope of the outbreak remains unclear, and Chinese officials have tried to contain the virus by locking down three cities with a combined population of more than 18 million people.
The virus can cause fever, coughing, trouble breathing and pneumonia.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump addressed the coronavirus, telling CNBC: "We have it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China. It's going to be just fine."
Given Trump's track record for honesty, I don't find that at all comforting.
Well, it's not like the Doomsday Clock is sending bad signals... I was feeling down about the state of the world Thursday, so I hopped on the internet and read this from a Chicago Tribune article:
"Calling world affairs 'highly unstable,' scientists on Thursday moved the fateful minute hand of the Doomsday Clock another 20 seconds closer to midnight, signifying that humanity is more perilously near global catastrophe than any other time in recent history."
Hoo boy.
The article quoted the University of Chicago's Rachel Bronson, who serves as president and CEO of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which started the clock in 1947: "We are now expressing how close the world is to catastrophe in seconds -- not hours, or even minutes. It is the closest to doomsday we have ever been in the history of the Doomsday Clock. We now face a true emergency -- an absolutely unacceptable state of world affairs that has eliminated any margin for error or further delay."
I'm never coming out from under the bed.
Hold on, hold on ... there is actually some positive news: Just to show not all hope is lost, some kind souls sneaked around Millennium Park and various spots along Michigan Avenue and left scarves for people who might need them, along with notes of encouragement.
My colleague Heidi Stevens wrote a column about the random act of kindness, committed by teachers and families at Central Middle School in Evergreen Park. (Column appears in Life+Travel, Page 3.)
Two of the notes fastened to the scarves read: "I was not forgotten here and neither are you. We hope this scarf brings you warmth" and "I am not lost, but I'm happy you found me. If you are cold and you need me, please take me. I hope I keep you warm all winter long. You are loved."
As Stevens wrote: "Some 80,000 of our residents are homeless, according to the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless. Does a scarf solve their suffering? Not even close. Does it still hold value? Absolutely."
Good has a remarkable talent for overcoming bad. Kudos to all behind the scarf project.
Pictures of America's last real president coming to Chicago: Portraits of former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will go on the road from the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., and stop first in Chicago next June.
Aside from acting as a sort of homecoming for the Obamas, the portraits will remind Art Institute visitors that there used to be a presidents who didn't tweet constantly and call people names.
The unique portraits have doubled attendance at the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery since they were unveiled in 2018 -- a fact that undoubtedly drives the current president crazy.

CITY &amp; STATE; Officials say L.A. is ready for virus

The Los Angeles area is bracing for the new strain of coronavirus, which has spread to at least 2,019 people in 14 countries and territories since it was discovered late last month in central China.
"While we have had no cases yet, it is likely we will see some, and we are ready," Dr. Sonia Angell, director of the California Department of Public Health, said in a video released this week.
As of Friday, 18 people between the ages of 3 and 58 had been tested for the virus in California, according to the state Department of Public Health. They included a traveler who arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on a flight from Mexico City and was taken to a hospital early Thursday for an evaluation.
Angell said the immediate health risk to the public in California is low, based on current information, but the department is carefully monitoring the virus and considers it "a serious public health concern."
So far, only two people have tested positive for the virus in the United States -- a man in Washington state and a woman in Illinois.
Though the U.S. has not seen a major outbreak, the virus has spread widely in Asia in the last month, killing at least 56 people and sickening nearly 2,000 more in China, officials there say.
In China, the pneumonia-like illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus first appeared last month in Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub in central China's Hubei province. Other cases have been reported in Japan, South Korea and Thailand. Singapore, Vietnam and Hong Kong reported their first cases Thursday.
Last week, federal authorities announced that passengers flying from Wuhan into LAX, San Francisco International Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York would be examined for the virus' symptoms.
Though the coronavirus hasn't yet arrived in California, it has affected travel agencies at a time when they typically do a brisk business. "Today is the first day of the Chinese New Year, but no one is here to go back to China," Albert Eng, owner of Chosen Travel in Monterey Park, said Saturday.

Death toll rises, along with global anxiety, as China fights outbreak
BEIJING " Chinese leader Xi Jinping warned Saturday the 'accelerating spread' of coronavirus infections had created a 'grave' situation in his populous nation, which extended travel restrictions to 48-million people in hardest-hit Hubei province, banned inter-province buses to Beijing and canceled tour group travel abroad.
As the Lunar New Year, China's biggest holiday, began without much of the usual festivity, Hong Kong announced that schools would be closed through Feb.-17. The United States, France and Russia sought ways to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan, the central Chinese city of 11-million where the outbreak originated and is continuing to spread.
The pneumonia-like disease caused by a new coronavirus has killed at least 56 people and infected more than 1,900 in China, though conditions in Wuhan " where overcrowded hospitals are short of basic supplies " have led to speculation the outbreak may be far worse.
Two cases have been confirmed in the United States " one in Chicago and one outside Seattle, in travelers who have returned from Wuhan. Infections also have turned up in South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan, France and Australia.
Though the vast majority of illnesses and all the fatalities have been within China, growing concern about the disease has rippled across the globe. Governments outside China have continued to ramp up precautions.
Japan, expecting 400,000 Chinese tourists this week, advised staff at airports and shops to wear face masks while serving customers, something usually considered inappropriate for public-facing employees. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said airlines arriving in Japan had been asked to distribute health surveys and advise customers to report symptoms, while checks had also been stepped up for people arriving by cruise ship.
In Granada, Spain, a tourist from Wuhan was isolated in a hospital after he showed up there with a fever, a Spanish media outlet reported. Other tourists in the group, who had no symptoms, were advised to remain in their hotel.
The International Olympic Committee moved a Summer Games qualifying event in boxing from Wuhan to Amman, Jordan. A women's soccer qualifying match also planned for Wuhan has been shifted to Nanjing, China. 
Facing the biggest public health challenge to the Chinese government in more than a decade, Xi instructed China's highest ruling council, the Politburo Standing Committee, to 'comprehensively mobilize' resources and manpower to provide medical aid, guarantee security and order in hospitals and provide markets with supplies in the cordoned-off city of Wuhan.
'As long as we are resolute . . . we can win the battle of controlling the epidemic,' he told top party leaders, according to state broadcaster CCTV.
Officials have announced the emergency construction of two hospitals to treat patients in Wuhan, where existing facilities are overflowing and medical personnel have been collapsing from exhaustion.
A study released Saturday suggested that each person with the virus is passing it to two or three others, which helps explain the rapid spread. The mathematical model from researchers at Imperial College London and the World Health Organization indicated that officials must stop more than 60 percent of the virus's transmission to control the outbreak. 
'It is uncertain at the current time whether it is possible to contain the continuing epidemic within China,' researchers wrote.
At U.S. airports, passengers arriving from China stood out because of the face masks almost all wore as protection against the virus. But they voiced varying levels of concern.
In Chicago, Sophia Shek, 42, of Hong Kong said life in her city over the last week has been 'pandemonium.' Long lines snaked through stores to purchase supplies, and some retailers have taken advantage of the crisis by hiking prices to as much as $60 a mask, she said. Friends asked her to stock up and bring back face masks and other short supplies.
She said she is anxious about the virus and traveled only because the trip was for work. 'I experienced SARS,' she said of the similar coronavirus that killed 774 people and infected more than 8,000, most of them in China, in 2002 and 2003. 'This new virus is dormant so you don't know if the person next to you has it.' 
Bridget Russell, 55, a nurse from Austin, said the only extra precaution she noticed in Beijing was a sensor that checked passengers' temperatures. The mood on her flight from the Chinese capital was calm, but she admitted, 'it was freaky looking up and seeing 99-percent of the people wearing masks.' She joined them, wearing one on the flight and at O'Hare International Airport after she arrived. 
At Los Angeles International Airport, Anthony Su, 53, who was on a flight from Taipei, Taiwan, to his home in Los Angeles after 10 days in Fuzhou, a city in southeastern China, said that when he first heard news of the outbreak, he stopped going out.
'I tried to avoid public areas, not go to the restaurant or any public place,' he said.
Others were more sanguine. 
'We had SARS, so we are not that terrified,' said Eric Tsang, 40, of Hong Kong. 'We have experience " masks on, wash your hands regularly, that's okay for us.' 
Tsang, visiting Los Angeles on business, said China has moved more quickly this time to quell the outbreak.
'China is doing better than before,' he said. 'At least they acted very quickly. They asked to stop everybody, even during the holiday. I think this is a wise move.'
The spread of the virus was felt halfway around the world in Lunar New Year celebrations of the Year of the Rat in Chinese communities in the United States. At the University of Washington in Seattle, 30 minutes south of where the first U.S. case was confirmed, dozens of Chinese students turned out for the festivities " with some wearing face masks. They crowded into a residence hall lobby festooned with red paper lanterns, red tablecloths and garlands with the Chinese character for happiness.
Lindsey Gao, an 18-year-old freshman, said she was impressed by people who donned masks to protect themselves, but she didn't think it was necessary.
'I admire them for doing that, but I think it looks a little weird,' said Gao, who emigrated from China when she was 6. Her mother, who lives on Mercer Island, across a floating bridge from Seattle, disagreed. 'She texted me last night, 'Did you buy a face mask?' I said no, and she said, 'Well, do you want to die?'-'
A Chinese woman who declined to give her name said she had canceled her family's restaurant reservations and would be having dinner at home. She doubted she'd be preparing a traditional Chinese feast; caution about the virus also kept her away from the Asian market to buy ingredients.
The Northwest Chinese School, with locations in Bellevue and Seattle, sent out an email calling off weekend classes. 'We take the health of our students and families very seriously and think that this is the best course of action,' administrators wrote. 
Kevin Ma, 28, a Seattle tutor, said he hasn't detected any stigma or ethnic profiling of Chinese people. 'I don't think we're there yet,' he said. 'People are pretty sensitive to the fact that just because you are Chinese doesn't mean you have it.'

New technologies and a spirit of openness have improved collaboration 
Just 10 days after a pneumonia-like illness was first reported among people who visited a seafood market in Wuhan, China, scientists released the genetic sequence of the coronavirus that sickened them. That precious bit of data, freely available to any researcher who wanted to study it, unleashed a massive collaborative effort to understand the mysterious new pathogen that has been rapidly spreading in China and beyond.
The genome was posted on a Friday night on an open-access repository for genetic information. By the next morning " Jan. 14 " Andrew Mesecar, a professor of cancer structural biology at Purdue University, had redirected his laboratory to start analyzing the DNA sequence, which bore a striking resemblance to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the 2002 viral outbreak that sickened more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health's Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Montana asked a company to turn the information from a string of letters on a computer screen into actual DNA they could study in lab dishes.
At unprecedented speed, scientists are starting experiments, sharing data and revealing the secrets of the pathogen " a race made possible by new scientific tools and cultural norms in the face of a public health emergency.
'The pace is unmatched,' said Karla Satchell, a professor of microbiology-immunology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. 'This is really new. Lots of people [in science] still try to hide what they're doing, don't want to talk about what they're doing, and everybody out there is like: 'This is like the case where we don't worry about egos, we don't worry about who's first, we just care about solving the problem.' The information flow has been really fast.'
Purdue University scientists are preparing to scale up production of experimental drugs they were initially developing to fight SARS, to see if they show promise against the new coronavirus. Twelve days after the genome was posted, NIH scientists published their first analysis, showing the coronavirus used the same door to get into human cells as SARS. About 12 hours later, a Chinese team of scientists who had isolated the virus from patients showed, using the actual virus, that the team was correct.
Meanwhile, a team at Northwestern recently ordered about a dozen pieces of the viral genome to be synthesized by a company to enable research that will help lead to drugs, vaccines and ways to rapidly diagnose the virus.
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview that with the viral genome, researchers have started on developing a vaccine. He is 'reasonably confident' that a safety study could begin testing it in people within three months.
'The fact that it's about three months is really, I think, remarkable, because that would be the fastest that we have ever gotten from the time we got the sequence to the time into a human,' Fauci said. 'If we can do that, it would be the fastest on the record.'
He cautioned that doesn't mean a vaccine would be widely available in three months; larger studies would be required to determine both the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine. But it is still science at light speed; during the SARS outbreak, it took 20 months from getting the virus to genome to the first tests of a vaccine in people.
When SARS began to spread, the tools scientists needed were much less mature, including the infrastructure for sharing results rapidly so anyone could build on them. It wasn't until 2013 that bioRxiv, a preprint server to share scientific papers, was created so scientists would have an easy way to widely share results before they had been vetted and accepted by scientific journals " a process that can take many months.
'This is one of the first times we're getting to see an outbreak of a new virus and have the scientific community sharing their data almost in real time,' said Michael Letko, a postdoctoral fellow at Rocky Mountain Laboratories.
Mesecar said the speed of science would have been almost unthinkable when researchers were working on SARS.
'Imagine walking from Chicago to San Francisco, and then imagine taking a plane from Chicago to San Francisco. That's kind of the difference,' Mesecar said.
He hopes revealing the secrets of the virus will help calm the spreading panic. He noted influenza sickens and kills large numbers of people in the United States and globally each year, but doesn't trigger a panic because the risks are understood and a vaccine exists.
'When you don't understand something, you panic. You have fear. When you gain an understanding, you don't fear something as much " you know how it's going to operate,' Mesecar said. 'By sharing that information faster …both research as well as what's happening on the ground with individuals, I'm hoping that panic and that fear are going to go down.'

The newly identified coronavirus that emerged last month from Wuhan, China, sickening more than 1,900 people in China and killing at least 56, has sparked growing anxiety and questions: How lethal is the virus? How can it be avoided? Is travel, especially to China, suddenly risky?
Here is what we know so far.
What is a coronavirus? 
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that range from the common cold to much more serious diseases, according to the World Health Organization. They can infect both humans and animals. The newly emergent strain in China is related to two other coronaviruses that have caused major outbreaks in recent years: MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, and SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The new virus hasn't been named yet; it's referred to as 'a novel coronavirus.'
How do coronaviruses spread? 
In rare cases, coronaviruses can spread from animals, such as camels and bats, to humans. (Household pets are not a threat.) The new virus is believed to have originated from a live animal market in Wuhan. But now it's clear, health authorities say, that the virus is spreading from person to person " likely through coughing and sneezing or touching an infected surface and then the mouth, nose or eyes, or coming into contact with contaminated fecal matter. 
What are the symptoms of infection from the novel coronavirus? 
Symptoms range from fever, muscle aches, dry cough, runny nose and shortness of breath to much more severe problems such as pneumonia, kidney failure and acute respiratory syndrome. The elderly, young and people with weakened immune systems are at a higher risk of developing acute problems, such as bronchitis and pneumonia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
How deadly is this virus and how is it treated? 
So far, the virus appears more serious than the common cold but less dangerous than SARS, public health experts have said. It does not appear to be anywhere near as-deadly as Ebola, which is harder-to transmit because it requires direct contact with an infected person's blood or bodily fluids.
Antibiotics don't work on viruses. There's no medication for the new coronavirus, though the National Institutes of Health said human vaccine trials could begin within three months. Currently, health-care professionals are focusing on providing 'supportive care,' including ensuring patients get plenty of liquids and oxygen.
The situation is fluid but getting worse. 
The CDC has urged travelers to avoid Wuhan. Several other Chinese cities also are essentially on lockdown. Even places that aren't quarantined are experiencing disruptions and closures that could affect where travelers go and how they get around. For example, Beijing's Forbidden City and Shanghai Disneyland have been shuttered, as have many theaters and temples. 
Would-be travelers can stay abreast of developments by checking the CDC website and monitoring alerts issued by the State Department and U.S. embassies.
Beijing authorities are restricting the movements of their own people. Officials said all inter-province bus services to and from Beijing would be halted in an effort to contain the outbreak, according to local news reports. In addition, officials are suspending domestic and overseas Chinese group tours, state media reported. 
Elsewhere in Asia, cases of infection appear isolated. Nevertheless, more vulnerable travelers, including those who have health issues or are older, should be cleared by a medical professional before departing.
If someone cancels a trip, will travel insurance refund the expenses? 
Yes, if the insurance was purchased with the 'cancel for any reason' benefit. This optional upgrade for the policy usually has several restrictions, but if the traveler meets the criteria, he or she can recover up to 75-percent of their trip costs. People with standard travel insurance who cancel because of fear of contracting the virus will have to absorb the losses, however. When traveling outside the United States, travelers should be sure they have travel medical insurance that will cover hospital costs if they fall ill while abroad or need to be taken back to the United States.
Are airlines, hotels and travel operators waiving change or cancellation fees? 
Some airlines are. Cathay Pacific passengers who reserved a ticket on or before Jan.-21 can rebook, reroute their flight or receive a refund without penalty for travel through March-31. Air China is also waiving change and cancellation fees for tickets issued by Jan.-31 for travel by March-29. Other airlines that are loosening their rules include United, China Eastern, China Southern and Hainan. Some carriers, however, are taking a wait-and-see approach.
Some hotels also are making it easier to rejigger plans: Hilton, Accor, InterContinental Hotels and Hyatt are easing restrictions, and not just on Wuhan hotels. The waiver covers changes and cancellations at properties throughout China, for travel through early February. To qualify, the booking must have occurred directly through the hotel; otherwise, the third-party agent should be contacted. 
Policies vary among tour operators and should be checked. 
What's the situation at airports? 
A large number of airports around the world have established enhanced screening procedures for passengers arriving from Wuhan, and a few countries, including India, are testing passengers arriving from any destination in China. South Korea's Incheon International Airport is employing ear thermometers. In Japan, arriving passengers must fill out health forms. Australia is distributing pamphlets. 
In the United States, the CDC and Customs and Border Protection are overseeing the process at five international airports in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta and Chicago. Screening for symptoms and elevated temperatures may add a few minutes to the arrival process. Passengers who test positive for coronavirus will be quarantined for further testing by the CDC. 
What's the best way for travelers to protect themselves before going to China?
The CDC recommends that everyone get a flu shot and other required vaccinations for their destinations. Any meat consumed should be fully cooked, and hands should be washed frequently and vigorously with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
Jesus Gonzalez, a physician with MedStar Health in Washington, recommends that travelers wear medical masks in crowded areas, such as train and bus stations and airports. 
What was China's experience with SARS and MERS? 
The SARS epidemic began in November 2002, and the virus moved to more than two dozen countries over eight months, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing 774. Health authorities say that 'Patient Zero' came in contact with an animal in China's Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong. The virus was finally contained in summer 2003. Health-care workers made up about 20-percent of the victims in areas hit hard by the disease, according to the World Health Organization. There's still no cure for the disease, but the initial outbreak was contained by isolating suspected patients and screening passengers traveling from infected areas or those suspected of having symptoms.
MERS emerged in the Middle East in 2012. Scientists say the first infection moved from a camel to a human in Saudi Arabia. The disease has been associated with-the death of 790 people since 2012, according to the CDC. Authorities-contained the outbreak by isolating patients and warning against contact with camels and camel meat during the scare.

'Why didn't I train for this?' I ask myself, only 20 minutes into my week-long cycling vacation. 
It's the October national holiday vacation week, when practically all of China goes somewhere else. During 'Golden Week,' trains and planes are all booked up and traffic is clogged. 
My husband and I have signed up with the Hutong, a small independent cultural center and school based in Beijing, for a week-long cycling and cultural tour of Xishuangbanna, in the southernmost part of Yunnan province, which is itself in the far southwest of China. With all logistical and travel arrangements taken care of, it promises to be the kind of stress-free break that we so crave. 
But a year of riding along the flat streets of Beijing has failed to prepare me for actual hills, and my thighs burn with disuse as we tackle the first of the day's 32 miles. My husband, on the other hand, seems fine, well prepared by the heavy shared bicycles he rides in the city every day. 
Our group of 12 hails from the United States, Australia, France, Spain, Brazil and China and ranges from early 30s up to late 70s. We're all 'stop and smell the jasmine' types, but once we start peddling, the casual conversation drops off. We are strung out, panting to ascend the deceptively gentle hill with local guide Wendy in the lead car in front and our support van at the back. 
Xishuangbanna is still a relatively quiet pocket of the world. The capital city of Jinghong sits on the banks of the Lancang river, known further downstream as the Mekong. As the mighty river connects much of Asia, winding all the way from the Tibetan Plateau to Vietnam, Jinghong will also eventually be connected to Laos and, beyond that, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore by high-speed train. High-rise apartment buildings are already sprouting from the verdant soil.
At the time of publication, the U.S. State Department had issued a Level 2 Travel Advisory for China due to the new coronavirus first identified in the city of Wuhan. Authorities have imposed travel restrictions on Wuhan, which is located in central China, about 1,300 miles from Xishuangbanna.
Yet for all the anticipatory buzz of this small regional capital, it's a chain of quiet mountain villages around it that will be my home for the duration of the October national holiday break. 
Bordering Myanmar and Laos, Xishuangbanna is a lush, fertile region of undulating green hills and tea plantations, banana fields, rice paddies and rainforest.
While the Han ethnic group makes up about 92 percent of the population of China, down here in the south, they are in the minority. Yunnan is one of the most ethnically diverse regions in the world, and 26 of China's 56 ethnic minorities reside here. The three local tour guides on our trip each represent a different minority: guide and front driver Wendy is of the Jinou minority, one of the smallest ethnic groups in China with a population of around 22,000; our driver A Jia is of the Hani minority, which is also distributed across Laos, Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam; and our 'sweeper' Sam, who rides at the back and provides an endless stream of jokes and encyclopedic commentary throughout the trip, is of the Dai people " the largest ethic group in the region, and descendants of a kingdom that once ruled much of what is now modern Xishuangbanna.
During the trip, we'll frequently be hosted by local families, and as the shadows begin to lengthen on our first day, we emerge straight from the old-growth forest into the village of Menglun, and a Dai family-style banquet. Large, low round tables are laden with local dishes: steamed pineapple rice, spicy fish, wild vegetables and herbs, marinated beef, pork and chicken, noodle soup, tofu stews, and spicy dipping sauces. We cluster around on low stools, famished after a long day of riding in the mountains.
We ride between 17 and 50 miles of hilly terrain per day and arrive at our destination each night spent, feeling a deep sense of satisfaction and relief as we lie down to sleep. Our lodgings are a mixture of hotels and rustic homestays in rural villages. 
All meals are communal and geared to an active lifestyle. Snack breaks are determined by Wendy, who stops whenever she sees a roadside stand with a good collection of fruit " juicy pomegranate, tart passion fruit, guava, coconut, mango, banana, pineapple, plantain, and huge chunks of sticky yellow jackfruit. With our bags safely stashed in the bus, we don't even have anything to carry. 
I'd hoped to spend the time doing some serious thinking but find that nothing is more worthy of my attention than the stunning land around me, the light filtering through the lush green forest leaves, the breathtaking vistas of rice paddies, small villages, distant temples, strutting roosters, the small green snake that briefly blocks my path, hissing, and young robed monks who fly around the bends, laughing, on their scooters. With a gazillion gears, my hybrid mountain bike turns out to be more than suited to tackling the steep hills, which instead of being conquered just need to be taken one turn of the crank at a time, and my mind drifts as easy and unworried as one of the many butterflies that flits around my head.
'The emperor is far away' . . . 
The day of the national holiday itself, Oct. 1, we are deep in rubber plantation territory. Planted in neat rows, the tall slender trees seep from carefully managed wounds into little saucers, each row another day of harvesting in this low-tech operation.
Our snack break is at a local rubber weigh station, an open-air shack with neatly stacked record books and equipment to measure the weight and viscosity of the liquid rubber. The station is managed by a young family, and as we nibble on fruit and hydrate, children jostle for position around the father's smartphone to watch the National Day parade in Beijing. And 2019 is the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, so the parade is something special. Soldiers march in strict uniformity, with a precision that is evident even on this tiny screen.
Then from apparently nowhere, a local man emerges with a large sack on his back, filled with rubber sap. Today is officially a holiday, but as the old Chinese saying goes, 'The mountains are high, and the emperor is far away' " what is decreed in the capital is easily ignored down here. Weights slide along the metal scale, and a figure is jotted down, then the entire sack is poured into a vat to join the rest, looking as cool and inviting as fresh milk, except for the pungent, rubbery smell.
The landscape changes yet again. Water buffalo soak in muddy pools beside fields of rice. At one large farm, rows of flowery, cactuslike dragonfruit plants droop over their wire props, heavy with juice that stains our fingers and lips a bright purply pink. 
It's both China's and a local resident's birthday, so that night in the riverside village of Manbo while we are lulled to sleep by the sound of rushing water, further up the road, the party continues at the karaoke bar until the wee hours.
. . . But not that far
Then suddenly, the emperor feels close again. In China, all foreigners are monitored, but in the village of Bulangshan, the authorities take a special interest. We're within a stone's throw of the Myanmar border, and the police are vigilant about illegal crossings, scrutinizing our passports until they are satisfied that we are simply passing through. 
The rain that we've been expecting finally arrives on the sixth day of our tour, as we pile our bowls full of rice noodles at the local outdoor restaurant in Manzhao. We top up with dollops of hoisin sauce, chili, scallion, brown vinegar and a fried egg over easy (our standard breakfast so far), then crowd under a shelter and watch the rain soak into the ground. 
The rain is still falling at the small family-run paper mill around the corner. This family still uses the traditional method to create sheets " dipping a large mesh rack into a pool of water cloudy with paper fibers. Lifted out, a smooth, thin layer of paper settles on the wire, ready to dry. We see the end result later the same day, at the Hani Cultural Center. 
Local bamboo paper, untreated and unbleached, is used to wrap the bricks of precious pu'er tea, which is unique to this region. Tea was reportedly first cultivated in Yunnan before India or anywhere else in China, and since we left Jinghong, we've ridden past acres and acres of the small shrubs, planted in neat rows and on sometimes improbably steep terrain. Fermented pu'er tea is roasted and left for up to 40 days before being withered and packed, giving it a rich, earthy flavor. Almost every meal on our trip is accompanied by a simple tea-pouring ceremony.
Further down the road, at the Hani Cultural Center, the boss, in every sense of the word, is Li Jie, 'Sister Li.' The matriarch of a Hani ethnic group family, she oversees the operation of the family's tea plantation and packing plant, which still uses age-old methods to pick, roast, dry, steam and pack the precious tea. She shows us around, sucking on her pipe and cracking jokes, picking handfuls of tea leaves in the same amount of time it takes us to identify one suitable sprout. 
While the methods may be old-fashioned, the center is not, and it is filled with stylishly presented traditional handicrafts and clothing by local makers, which she both wears and insists that we try on. Despite my padded bike shorts, I am captivated by the beauty of my outfit, which includes a huge handmade headdress. Adorned with hammered silver discs, rows of beading, brightly colored dyed feathers and bright pompoms, it somehow makes me feel not ludicrous but regal. Later, when I post a photo online, a Thai friend will exclaim in recognition. Many more Hani people live in Thailand.
Later that night, Li Jie comes to our hotel. Under her watchful eye, a bonfire is arranged, and after obligatory toasts, she and her friends share traditional songs and dances. As far as cultural exchanges go, it's an uneven one. After a rendition of 'Old MacDonald' and the Australian folk song 'Give Me a Home Among the Gum Trees,' we resort to the perennial dance classic " the Macarena. 
A parting gift from the mountains on our last day is almost 12 miles of smooth, uninterrupted downhill. We fly down at imprudent speeds as we lean giddily into the curves. By the time we reach Jinghong again, we'll have ascended and descended over 22,000 feet and covered almost 240 miles. Yet as we go over the map that night, we're shocked to realize that during our week-long trip, despite feeling as though we were thousands of miles from civilization, we were never more than an easy day's drive from the city.
As our little plane vaults into the sky, Jinghong rapidly vanishes back into the lush Xishuangbanna forest, which seems to stretch on forever.

Face masks are flying off shelves. Do they work?

Pedestrians in disposable face masks have become a defining image of the coronavirus outbreak in China. Some areas have reported shortages as people rush to prepare for the worst.
Experts say masks can be helpful in preventing the spread of the virus " if worn properly, under the right conditions.
For now, public health officials say there's no need to wear face masks in the United States, but they do recommend them in China, especially for people who think they may be sick. Demand for masks is surging, and manufacturers in China and the United States are increasing production.
Here are the key facts.
How do they work?
The most commonly worn, cheap and disposable masks, known as the surgical masks, will limit " but not eliminate " the chance of inhaling large, infectious particles circulating near the face, said Marybeth Sexton, an assistant professor at Emory University School of Medicine. Even with perfect use, these masks aren't foolproof because a virus or pathogen can still slip through the sides or enter the body through the eyes.
All in all, the science suggests they are a flawed but valid line of defense.
The outer fabric of surgical face masks is usually yellow or blue with one elastic or wire edge for tightening. To put it on properly, the mask's absorbent side must be worn facing in and the colored side facing out. The mask needs to fit securely over the mouth, chin and nose. That is why the edge with the metal strip is put at the top " so that the metal can be molded over the nose.
Removing the mask correctly is equally important. The mask should be treated as if it's contaminated and pulled off by the straps around the ears, and never just lowered from the mouth.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that any health-care workers interacting with coronavirus patients or suspected cases wear a stronger kind of mask, known as the N95 respirator, along with other gear such as gloves and eye protectors.
The N95 filters out 95-percent of pollutants and is 'highly effective' in preventing the transmission of viruses, Sexton said. However, these masks must be specially fitted and therefore are not commonly worn outside of the health care setting.
Should I wear one?
Infectious-disease experts said that there's little need to wear face masks in the United States, where just two cases of coronavirus have been confirmed and the patients are in stable condition in hospitals.
Given the low threat level, covering one's face and nose isn't necessary when outside or in a place with good ventilation, said Colleen Kraft, associate chief medical officer for Emory University Hospital, who helped treat the first U.S. Ebola cases in 2014.
'Wearing a mask walking around isn't going to do any good, but if you're in a situation where you're highly exposed, a mask is helpful,' Kraft said. 'You may wear a mask when someone is going to cough directly on you or [in] a place with a lot of ill people. In a hospital, we wear a mask with patients who have influenza.'
Kraft said that people in the United States should instead be taking the same precautions they would to avoid contracting the flu, such as being vigilant about washing hands regularly and cautious about touching their faces and possibly contaminated surfaces.
Are there enough masks?
Chinese authorities have been encouraging people to wear face masks covering their mouths and noses, which has led to a surge in demand.
Chinese face mask manufacturers have reported that they're running factories through the Lunar New Year holiday break to keep up. Companies are even offering to increase workers' wages dramatically to entice them to return to work and stay for longer hours.
'From what I have heard, the mask shortage is much, much more severe than what the public knows,' Cao Jun, the general manager of the Chinese mask manufacturer Lanhine, told Reuters. 'Almost all hospital workers nationwide are facing a huge shortage of masks, not just in Wuhan. That's very terrible.'
Usually Cao's company produces 400,000 masks daily, but demand has skyrocketed to 200-million.
As part of China's emergency efforts, state media reported that the country's minister of industry has ordered factories 'to overcome labor difficulties during the Spring Festival, accelerate production and do their utmost to increase supply to the market,' face masks included, Reuters reported. On social media, hospitals and health workers have been making urgent pleas for supplies including face masks.
E-commerce platforms that are popular in China, such as Taobao, have warned sellers not to increase prices on face masks. Nonetheless, news sites have reported increases over five times the usual prices. The Straits Times, a newspaper in Singapore, reported that Chinese nationals there are stocking up on protective gear to send to family members in China.
U.S. face mask manufacturers told The Washington Post that they also are dealing with a jump in demand.
'We are experiencing a surge in demand for our protective face masks in North America, Europe and China,' Honeywell International, based in North Carolina, said in a statement. 'We are increasing production at multiple facilities globally, and we are fulfilling all current orders.'
3M, a major manufacturer based in Minnesota, also reported an increase in production after a rise in demand from China for respiratory protection products.
This is part of why the U.S. government keeps a face mask stockpile for emergencies.
As The Post's Lena Sun reported, the U.S. government has several secret storage facilities holding drugs and supplies that are part of a $7-billion Strategic National Stockpile ready to be used in the case of a bioterrorism or nuclear attack or an outbreak of an infectious disease. The medical contents of the repository held nationwide would cover more than 31-football fields if laid out.

China's attempt to quarantine millions of people could backfire, experts say

Such extreme efforts are difficult to enforce, can sow mistrust
China's quarantine of more than 35 million people, almost certainly the largest in modern public-health history, is surprising and troubling experts who said such drastic restrictions rarely work and often backfire.
In the United States, mandatory limits on movement for people in whole cities or regions have received little serious consideration in planning for disease outbreaks like the coronavirus infection now sweeping across China, according to public-health authorities and a review of government reports.
'This is just mind-boggling: This is the mother of all quarantines,' said University of Michigan medical historian Howard Markel. 'I could never have imagined it.'
Cordoning off a region like China's Hubei province pens the sick together with the uninfected. It increases the burden on authorities, who must ensure the flow of food, water and other supplies to the quarantined area. It is nearly impossible to enforce. And it sows distrust in government at a time when public support is essential, prompting people to evade the restrictions or refuse to report their symptoms, experts said.
'The first and golden rule of public health is you have to gain the trust of the population, and this is likely to drive the epidemic underground,' said Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. 'The truth is those kinds of lockdowns are very rare and never effective.'
From a practical standpoint, 'where does one draw the line?' asked Leana Wen, the former health commissioner for the city of Baltimore. 'Many people work in the city and live in neighboring counties, and vice versa. Would people be separated from their families? How would every road be blocked? How would supplies reach residents?'
'We worked on numerous contingency plans to respond to outbreaks and other public-health crises,' she added. 'To my knowledge, our health department had not considered a citywide quarantine.'
With 41 people confirmed dead and more than 1,000 infected, China has cut all transportation links into and out of Wuhan " a city of 11 million where the new virus originated " and 13 other cites across the center of the country, as celebrations of the Lunar New Year began Friday. Normally, 400 million people could be expected to travel across Asia during the Spring Festival, but the government has adopted a drastic course of action in the face of the health crisis.
'They're doing it because people who are in political leadership always think that if you do something dramatic and visible that you'll gain popular support,' Gostin said. 'They couldn't have any sound public health advice.'
The Chinese may gain some advantage from the quarantine if it helps reduce travel and increases 'social distancing,' a reliable tactic in the spread of infectious disease that means keeping people apart as much as possible, said Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
'Like many things, it depends on how you do it,' Frieden said. 'Cordoning off a city would have a positive impact if that reduces travel and the amount of mixing you have.' 
Recent quarantine attempts have met with little success. During the Ebola epidemic of 2014, an attempt to cordon off the West Point slum in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, sparked violent clashes and evasion of the lockdown, including by residents who bribed their way in and out. During the same crisis, Sierra Leone locked down most of its population for three days, which may have led to underreporting of symptoms.
But a five-day shutdown of businesses across Mexico may have helped slow the spread of the H1N1 swine flu there in 2009.
More than a century ago, authorities tried but quickly abandoned partial quarantines of Philadelphia and Chicago during the 1918 flu pandemic that killed as many as 40 million people worldwide and more than a half-million in the United States.
During the second wave of that epidemic, however, a few tiny communities, such as a naval base in San Francisco Bay and the mining town of Gunnison, Colo., were able to block the flu by voluntarily cutting off all contact with the outside world, according to a 2006 study led by Markel. 
Quarantining millions of people may be easier in an authoritarian country like China. But even in the United States, authorities have broad power to order quarantines as a last resort. In a 2007 report to the CDC on responding to a flu pandemic, an expert panel makes no recommendation to use mandatory lockdowns, even in the most severe, or 'Category 5' outbreak " one in which an astronomical 2-percent of those diagnosed with an infection die. 
Rather, the report says authorities should rely on voluntary isolation of the sick at home; voluntary quarantine at home of uninfected people with sick family members; limiting activities in schools; limiting or banning mass gatherings; social distancing; and encouraging people to work from home. 
These would be added to typical public-health measures such as surveillance of the spread of the disease and tracing the contacts of sick people.
In 2006, the Homeland Security Council and the CDC released a 233-page strategy that warned a modern pandemic could kill as many as 200,000 to 2 million Americans. 
The unlikely use of 'geographic quarantine' would result in 'the detention, within an epidemic zone, of persons who may or may not have been exposed to the pathogen in question,' according to the report.
But the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza noted that a virus is likely to quickly surface in more than one location. When that occurs, the success of a geographic quarantine would be 'profoundly limited,' effectively making it a remote option for curbing a pandemic. 
'The implementation of conventional geographic quarantine imposes significant opportunity costs and may result in the diversion of significant resources and assets that might be used to better effect supporting less draconian disease-containment measures,' according to the report. 
Still, the document called on state and local governments to devise their own pandemic strategies that at least include the possibility of a widespread quarantine " one that would probably be ordered by state or local governments and enforced by National Guard troops if necessary.
'If directed by the President pursuant to the Insurrection Act, the military may suppress domestic unrest associated with resistance to a state quarantine,' the document stated, referring to the 1807 law that outlines presidential power to combat domestic unrest.
States have developed their own plans for responding to pandemics. A 2014 report by the Illinois Department of Public Health declares that the state has 'absolute authority in matters of quarantine and isolation, and may declare and enforce quarantine when none exists.' 
But the document says the practice would most likely be used only in highly localized settings, such as restricting the movements of a group of nursing home residents or airline passengers who may have been exposed to a disease but are not yet symptomatic. 
'Quarantine . . . is not effective in controlling multiple influenza outbreaks because the disease spreads too rapidly to identify and to control chains of transmission,' it states. But like the Homeland Security report, Illinois' strategy appears to keep the door open for a more widespread use of quarantine in extreme circumstances.

Beijing " China locked down more than 35-million people in an increasingly urgent effort to halt the spread of the deadly coronavirus Friday, as the United States confirmed a second infected person and the respiratory illness found its way to Europe, where the first three cases were announced in France.
The pneumonia-like disease has claimed 41 lives " all in China " and infected more than 1,000 people there. An official at the World Health Organization told reporters that his agency has begun planning for an outbreak that will last for months. 
Infections have been confirmed in France, South Korea, Japan, Nepal, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan and the United States. 
At least 50 people are under observation for the illness in 22 U.S. states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The second U.S. patient is a woman, a Chicago resident, who traveled to Wuhan, China " where the virus originated " in late December and returned Jan.-13, the CDC announced Friday. A few days later, she began to feel ill and saw a doctor. She was asked about her travel history, then referred to a hospital, which isolated her and arranged for testing. 
The woman is in stable condition but will remain in the hospital mainly to ensure she does not spread the virus. On Tuesday, authorities revealed the first U.S. case, a man in his 30s from Snohomish County, Wash., who had recently returned from a visit to Wuhan. Authorities said they are monitoring 50 of the man's contacts for signs of infection.
The CDC deployed a team to help with the Chicago case. The woman 'has not had any extended close contact with anyone outside her home since returning, and that should be very reassuring to the public,' Allison Arwady, Chicago's public health commissioner, told reporters Friday. 
Health officials briefed about two dozen senators Friday. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he 'wouldn't be surprised if there are additional cases.' But he said public-health authorities acted quickly in Illinois, where they 'identified, isolated and did contact tracing on the people with whom that person came into contact. That's how you get your handle on an outbreak.'
After the briefing, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) called on President Trump to declare the outbreak a public-health emergency.
Although the outbreak is a 'very serious public-health threat, the immediate risk to the U.S. public is low at this time,' Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters in a briefing Friday.
Circumstances in the United States were overshadowed by the apparently deteriorating conditions in China. The Chinese medical system is struggling to cope with the outbreak, amid reports of overcrowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies.
A ban on travel was extended to 14 cities, with a total population of more than 35-million in central China's Hubei province. Tunnels under the Yangtze River were blocked to stop the flow of traffic, and all ride-hailing services in Wuhan were halted at midday Friday. Only half the city's taxis are allowed on the road each day.
China Southern, the country's biggest airline, had already canceled flights in and out of Wuhan airport on Thursday. The other two main carriers, Air China and China Eastern, said they would cancel all Wuhan flights from Friday until at least Feb.-8.
As the Lunar New Year began, authorities have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that normally accompany the nation's biggest holiday. Large public gatherings could aid the spread of the airborne virus.
Nevertheless, state broadcaster CCTV led its midday news program with a report about a huge banquet in Beijing attended by President Xi Jinping and other Communist Party leaders. None of them was wearing a mask, and the report made no mention of the virus outbreak.
Other senior Chinese officials came under heavy criticism for their slow response to the outbreak. The mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, allowed a huge potluck banquet to proceed Sunday, during a weekend when the number of confirmed infections shot up dramatically. The city had arranged a Lunar New Year meal featuring 14,000 dishes for more than 40,000 people, an event it hoped to get listed in Guinness World Records.
Residents were also surprised by photos and video of the two top officials in Hubei province " the Communist Party secretary and the governor " at a dance performance in Wuhan to celebrate the arrival of the Spring Festival holiday. They were sharply criticized for enjoying themselves instead of working on the response to the health crisis.
The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice. Shanghai Disneyland, which normally has 10-million visitors a year, announced Friday that it would shut down indefinitely starting Saturday.
Production companies have postponed the release of seven films over the holiday, prompting Chinese cinema companies to close the country's 70,000 movie theaters.
Schools in Hubei province, due to begin the spring semester after the holiday, will not open their doors as planned but will wait for further guidance from health authorities. The Education Ministry instructed universities around China to delay their opening dates if necessary.
Workers are racing to build a 1,000-bed hospital for people with the disease in Wuhan, an indication that Chinese officials expect, or already have, a much larger number of cases. It is modeled after a medical facility specially built in 2003 for patients with SARS, another respiratory infection that began in China and claimed more than 750 lives in more than a dozen countries. The new virus is closely related to the SARS coronavirus.
China's state-run Xinhua News Agency said the new hospital is needed 'to address the insufficiency of existing medical resources.'
One of the most recent fatalities was a young, previously healthy man in Wuhan, raising concerns about the deadliness of the virus. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-viral medication and antibiotics since he was admitted to a hospital on Jan.-9.
Until now, the vast majority of victims have been older than 60 with underlying health conditions.
Despite the escalating toll, some analysts remained concerned that the Chinese government was significantly underreporting the number of cases. A financial analyst for the investment firm Raymond James told clients in a report Thursday night that he believes the numbers are likely at least 10 times the publicly reported total.
With transportation restrictions imposed by China, U.S. officials said Friday they are assessing the extent and duration of screening travelers from Wuhan to airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta and Chicago. The lockdown in Wuhan and nearby cities means fewer travelers from there are arriving in the United States.
The labor-intensive airport screening is being conducted by the CDC. But sick patients with no symptoms might not be detected.
To control the spread of the virus, resources must be focused at the state and local levels, where front-line health officials are trying to rapidly identify cases, said Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's division of global migration and quarantine.

D.C.-area schools weigh student safety amid fires, virus outbreak, protests
A novel, potentially lethal virus in China. Bush fires in Australia. Political protests in Hong Kong.
Amid turmoil in different corners of the world, universities that send students to far-flung destinations have temporarily curtailed some programs while closely monitoring others.
Nine American University students studying in Beijing are hundreds of miles from the center of a coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China. But they have been encouraged to wear surgical masks, wash their hands frequently and avoid large crowds, said Mark Hayes, director of the school's study-abroad programs.
'None of them are in the affected areas that have been quarantined,' Hayes said. 'We have been working to give them information.'
Three students from Georgetown University are studying in Beijing, said Meghan Dubyak, a spokeswoman. The school issued a campuswide advisory in recent days urging students and faculty to get flu shots and to rely on International SOS, a platform that provides medical alerts and evacuation services for students and faculty abroad.
Authorities in Wuhan have halted regional travel, and hundreds of flights from the city's international airport were canceled Thursday. In Beijing, officials have canceled mass Lunar New Year celebrations, hoping to limit the spread of the airborne illness.
China's leader, Xi Jinping, warned Saturday of an 'accelerating spread' of the virus that has claimed at least 55 lives. Infections have been confirmed in cities throughout China " including Beijing " and in Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Nepal, Australia, France and the United States.
The response to the coronavirus has been rapidly evolving: On Saturday, Hong Kong announced schools would be closed until mid-February.
Leaders at George Washington University have shared safety information with students studying in China and other countries, Crystal Nosal, a spokeswoman, said in an email.
'Students were encouraged to stay aware and seek the most up-to-date information from their programs about the changing conditions while in the country or traveling through the region,' Nosal said. 'The health and welfare of our community members is our utmost priority.'
But even before the emergence of a new coronavirus was widely recognized, several campuses in the District " American, Catholic, George Washington and Georgetown universities " were suspending academic programs for another reason: explosive protests in Hong Kong that have gained international attention.
The demonstrations were triggered by legislation that would have allowed the extradition of criminal defendants to mainland China. Hong Kong's government formally withdrew the proposal in October, but protesters want officials to meet other demands " including an independent investigation into police conduct and direct elections for government leaders.
Study-abroad program directors must tread a fine line between obstructing students' ability to explore new places and keeping them safe.
In November, the peaceful protests in Hong Kong took a turn when a student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology died after demonstrators clashed with police.
'The protests moved onto college campuses,' said Grace Schnei der, director of education abroad at Catholic University. 'Hong Kong is one that, obviously, it was a long time ramping up. The protests started small, nonviolent, and went on for months.'
Leaders at Georgetown evacuated a group of students who were studying at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in November, said Livvy Gordon, a junior and global business major at Georgetown.
'We had been in Hong Kong for almost three months at that point, and I had seen one protest from afar,' Gordon said. 'We were shocked once it began to escalate and once things moved to campus.'
Some students see political unrest as a learning opportunity. Rohit Seth, a 19-year-old sophomore at American University, said he wants a chance to understand, firsthand, the tension between pro-Brexit and pro-European Union voters in London. Hundreds of thousands of protesters filled the streets of London in October to decry the Brexit referendum authorizing the United Kingdom to withdraw from the E.U.
'With everything happening with Brexit, I think it's important to be abroad when all this big stuff is happening,' Seth said at an information session for students looking for study-abroad opportunities.
AU's Hayes said his office has warned students about potential travel issues in the region. Brexit could affect students' ability to travel across Europe and return to their host school in London.
AU in recent years discontinued a study-abroad program in Aleppo, Syria, and evacuated students from Beirut amid safety concerns. Catholic suspended its program in Chile this semester after protesters fought a subway fare increase in October.
Two popular study-abroad sites in Australia " Sydney and Melbourne " have not been directly affected by bush fires engulfing parts of the country, but program directors are still monitoring the flames. 
Four Howard University students are studying in Sydney, about 50 miles away from the fire zone, said Maraina Montgomery, assistant director of study-abroad programs.
Officials do not expect programs to be upended by fires but are concerned about air quality. Reports from Melbourne said air quality in mid-January was six times worse than what's considered healthy. In recent days, conditions have improved.
Bryony Whitelaw, a junior at AU, said her host school in Melbourne has sent information about where the fires are roaring and how far those sites are from campus.
'I'm not looking forward to it if it is as bad as it has been the last few days, but I should be fine,' Whitelaw said about the air quality in mid-January. 
Scientists have cited climate change as the underlying cause of an outbreak of fires that have cost more than two dozen people their lives and destroyed upward of 2,000 homes. Whitelaw views it as a learning opportunity.
'Maybe it's an opportunity for the world to get together and say we need to make some radical changes there,' Whitelaw said.
At the Institute for the International Education of Students, also called IES Abroad, faculty are encouraged to embrace the chaos, said William Hoye, executive vice president and chief operating officer. The nonprofit offers study-abroad programs in 34 locations around the world.
'We're often focused on our faculty making sure what's happening in the country has a teachable moment,' Hoye said. 'We want the faculty and staff to not just understand where the protests are, but why the protests are.'
IES suspended summer programs in Hong Kong and is offering students in Sydney the option to move their studies to neighboring New Zealand, Hoye said.
Foreign universities that host American students regularly issue safety tips to prospective students. Study-abroad offices at Washington-area schools reported sharing a host of resources with students, including State Department travel advisories and travel insurance, in case programs are abruptly cut short.
'When countries are more unstable, we'll be a little more cautious with students, letting them know upfront about the situation and that we don't necessarily know yet what's going to happen,' Catholic University's Schneider said.

STARBUCKS CORP.
SBUX -1.2%
First Starbucks tossed its plastic straws. Now the coffee giant wants to cut its water use and the amount of trash it sends to landfills over the next decade, the latest big company to set fresh targets for limiting its environmental impact. Starbucks said Tuesday it will aim to serve more coffee in reusable cups, curb food and packaging waste and set a more environmentally friendly menu. New stores will make more efficient use of energy and water, and improve environmental practices among coffee growers and other suppliers. Shares fell 1.2% Tuesday.
UBER TECHNOLOGIES INC.
UBER +7%
Uber might give drivers the green light to set their fares. Drivers who ferry passengers from airports in Santa Barbara, Palm Springs and Sacramento can now charge up to five times the fare Uber sets on a ride, a test that started Tuesday. The experiment is part of Uber's effort to show that its drivers operate with some degree of independence. Earlier this month, Uber capped its commissions on rides across California. Last month, it allowed drivers in the state to see where riders were going, letting them choose the trips they wanted to take. Shares gained 7% Tuesday.
AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.
AAL -4.2%
Worries about a pneumonia-like virus are circulating through the airline industry as more people in China choose not to travel. Typically hundreds of millions visit family or take a vacation during the Lunar New Year holiday. This year many are staying home due to the coronavirus, which originated in China. The confirmed cases tripled Monday, and accelerated all week. Shares of American Airlines fell 4.2% Tuesday.
NETFLIX INC.
NFLX -3.6%
Foreign features are now in vogue at Netflix, where an overseas expansion is providing more new streaming subscribers as the U.S. slows. Netflix said Tuesday that it added 423,000 domestic subscribers in the quarter, lower than its forecast of 600,000. It beat expectations for subscriber growth overseas. The streaming giant already faces heightened competition from a gaggle of domestic rivals including Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+ and Apple Inc.'s Apple TV+. The U.S. landscape will get more crowded this spring with the arrivals of Peacock and HBO Max. Shares fell 3.6% Wednesday.
EXPRESS INC.
EXPR +21%
The fashion retailer said it would close about 100 stores by 2022, including nine stores that closed last year and 31 that will close by the end of the month. The store closures are part of a broader overhaul, as the company anticipates $80 million in cost cuts over the next three years, including $55 million primarily related to job cuts it disclosed last week. It is cutting 10% of the positions at its Columbus, Ohio, headquarters and its design studio in New York City. Express also said it is planning to relaunch its loyalty and private-label credit card this fall as part of the effort. Shares gained 21% Tuesday.
MATCH GROUP INC.
MTCH -1.2%
Online dating now has an alarm. Tinder plans to start offering users an option to hit a panic button, receive check-ins, and summon authorities. To offer the service, Tinder parent company Match Group is taking a stake and board seat in an app called Noonlight that tracks users' locations. Tinder plans to debut the feature free for U.S. users at the end of January. The company has been criticized for not doing more to screen out bad actors, often in the wake of reports of crimes that result from connections made through dating apps. Shares fell 1.2% Thursday.
INTEL CORP.
INTC +8.1%
Intel Corp.'s customers are clearly hungry for more chips. The company posted strong fourth-quarter earnings that benefited from an upswing in personal-computer shipments and robust demand for server farms that need chips to store large amounts of data. The results are the latest sign technology companies expect healthy demand despite wider expectations for a modest economic rebound this year. Intel still faces challenges, including chip supply shortages, loss of market share and turmoil from the U.S.-China trade tussle. Intel shares rose 8.1% Friday.

Virus Tests China's Scientific Ambitions --- Early indications point to a troubled performance, even after Beijing invested billions

China wants to become a world leader in health and science. It has invested billions in cutting-edge drugs, state-of-the-art laboratories and research at the frontiers of medicine. Its political leaders want Chinese scientists to win Nobel Prizes.
All that prowess and ambition is now being put to the test by an elementary health challenge: a deadly infectious disease outbreak.
Early indications are that its performance is troubled.
A new coronavirus that began infecting people in the city of Wuhan in December has sickened nearly 1,300 people in China, killing at least 41, and has appeared in a handful of other countries, including the U.S. A second case was disclosed in the U.S. on Friday, a woman in Chicago who was infected in Wuhan, and the disease spread into Europe and Australia for the first time.
Chinese and international health authorities are racing to learn more about the new virus, where it came from and how easily it spreads. In the meantime, they say it's inevitable more people will become ill.
Global health officials say China's response to the outbreak is a vast improvement over its handling of a deadly epidemic 17 years ago of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. Chinese authorities initially hid the outbreak of that new virus, then played it down for four months.
In this new outbreak, Chinese health authorities disclosed cases within days of discovery. By early January, they had sequenced the genome of the new virus and made it available to researchers around the world. That promises to speed the development of diagnostic tools, as well as possible vaccines and treatments.
Yet nearly a month after discovering the first cases, Chinese health officials have made little progress in stopping its spread. As many as 4,000 people in Wuhan may have been infected with the new virus as of Jan. 18, according to the most recent estimate by Neil Ferguson, a disease modeler at Imperial College London.
Global public-health experts and local citizens said China has been slow to publicly disclose some basic clues about the virus and how it is being transmitted, though some research can take time.
"We don't know how infectious it is, we don't know how severe it is, and we don't know how it's spreading," said Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who is now president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit initiative focused on epidemics and heart disease.
Hospitals are overcrowded and struggling to test everyone who comes in. Chinese citizens say they suspect the numbers may be understated.
Political and health authorities appeared to take strong action only after public comments from President Xi Jinping. Officials should "release outbreak information in a timely manner and deepen international cooperation," he said Monday.
Officials followed by announcing the largest quarantine in history, shutting down public transit, blocking roads and imposing travel restrictions on people in Wuhan, a sprawl of 11 million people, and in roughly a dozen other nearby cities. Many epidemic experts say that is unlikely to be effective.
China's skills in certain basic public-health tasks, such as outbreak investigations, are uneven, despite its world-class genomics, virologists, and gleaming hospitals, according to one person familiar with China's public-health system.
The stakes are enormous for China. Mr. Xi has made it a priority to revive the country's stature on the global stage. That includes proving to the world China can handle a health problem in ways that it failed to with SARS, when 774 people died. Failure to contain this new outbreak soon could damage China's reputation and hurt its economy.
The country's investment in medical and public-health capabilities means it should be able to deliver a robust outbreak response, experts say. China is a hot spot for emerging viruses, with its large bat populations -- which are hosts to many of these pathogens -- along with densely populated rural areas and a long tradition of eating exotic wildlife.
"It's very clear the government has spent a lot of money building technology, and attracting talent from abroad, and you would expect them to do a better job this time," said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York who analyzed the country's response to SARS and its aftermath.
Health officials generally make public "epi" or epidemic curves charts to show when illnesses begin, and therefore how intensely the virus is spreading.
The WHO's representative in China, Gauden Galea, said Chinese authorities shared a detailed epi curve this week with a committee considering whether to declare the outbreak a public-health concern.
"We could have had an epi curve three weeks ago," said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.
The WHO's current director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said through a spokeswoman that Chinese authorities are sharing data and other information about the outbreak. "There is an open channel with senior officials," he said. "We're getting the cooperation and on information-sharing, they have been very open."
Calls to China's National Health Commission and Ministry of Science and Technology weren't answered Friday during the Lunar New Year holiday.
The WHO first learned about the outbreak of an unusual pneumonia in Wuhan from an official statement by Wuhan authorities, Dr. Galea, the WHO's China representative, said in the interview. China's cabinet-level National Health Commission formally notified the WHO the next day, he said.
Chinese officials told the WHO emergency committee this week that their preliminary calculations show each infected person infects between 1.4 and 2.5 more people, Dr. Galea said. That number could change, he added, because it's unknown how many people are infected; people who are only mildly ill might not seek medical care.
"Everyone is impatient to get the answers, but we do know that research like this is being done and it's just a matter of time before that also is shared with the scientific community," he said.
Collaboration with international researchers could help speed the effort to understand and contain the virus, he said. There's a diagnostic test now. International researchers could help develop additional tests to detect whether people had been infected in the past, he said.
Wuhan disclosed the first 27 cases of pneumonia, connected to the Huanan animal wholesale market on Dec. 31, after rumors had been circulating for days on Chinese social media about pneumonia cases that were similar to SARS.
Wuhan closed the market on New Year's Day, but was slow to step up public warnings about the virus. Around the start of the year, police temporarily detained eight people it alleged had spread false information about the virus. City health officials said in several statements that there was either no evidence the virus could be passed between humans or a low risk of it.
Officials stuck to that messaging even as they disclosed an infected family in which the husband worked at the animal wholesale market while his wife, also infected, claimed no exposure to it.
Provincial and municipal officials preoccupied themselves with annual policy meetings. The virus wasn't on official agendas.
Senior Hubei province officials were enjoying an evening gala at a Wuhan concert hall on Tuesday, a day after the government disclosed a sharp increase in the number of cases and Mr. Xi ordered officials to improve their response and disclose more information. The mood was cheerful, with shows featuring patriotic singing, red ribbons, and dancers in ethnic minority costumes.
Soon, hospitals in and around Wuhan were reporting more cases to the National Health Commission in Beijing. It caught the attention of the cabinet-level body, which on Sunday sent experts to Wuhan for a closer look.
The group concluded that the situation was severe enough to recommend authorities lock down the city. Only top leaders in Beijing had the authority to make the call. After the team returned to Beijing, Mr. Xi instructed the central government to set up a task force to tackle the outbreak and signed off on the lockdown.
Since SARS, China has improved hygiene at wet markets, where most Chinese people buy food, and sought to encourage licensed trade in wild animals bred on farms. Yet regulation of wildlife farms and markets has been lax, researchers and wildlife activists say.
Chinese medical officials have found traces of the virus in the closed Huanan market, but couldn't determine a specific animal source, according to Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
In the wake of SARS, China made a play for more influence at the top of the World Health Organization, which had been critical of China's initial response to the outbreak. In November 2006, a doctor named Margaret Chan was named director-general of the WHO, largely the result of lobbying by a respected Communist Party elder, Wu Yi. They had worked together to contain SARS.
When Mr. Xi hosted a major WHO conference in Beijing in 2016, Dr. Chan lavished praise on China's advances in health care. "In essence, China has given its huge population a safety net that protects people from being impoverished by the costs of health care. This makes a tremendous contribution to a fair and prosperous society," she said.
The WHO didn't respond to questions about the organization's relationship with top officials while Dr. Chan led it, until 2017. Dr. Chan couldn't immediately be reached.
One of China's biggest contributions to its health-care system is new hospitals. According to municipal government reports, Wuhan built 69 hospitals in three years, for a total 335 in 2017, and employed 62% more in the medical sector, not including robots plying the halls of some facilities.
Yet the outbreak is straining the resources of front-line hospital staff. On Friday, dozens of construction excavators were clearing a field for a temporary 1,000-bed isolation and treatment ward built according to a model used in Beijing to coordinate efforts to control SARS.
After the citywide quarantine prompted many in Wuhan to seek medical attention on Thursday, several hospitals made appeals through social media for a range of medical supplies, including masks and disinfectant.
"Currently, doctors and nurses fighting at the front lines can only supply a limited amount of all kinds of protective materials," said a message from Hubei Children's Medical Center, which carried a reminder it is the city's only children's hospital and that it faces "an arduous task" in its fever wards.

EXCHANGE --- Currencies: Yuan Weakens as Investors Worry About China Growth

China's currency weakened ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, as the widening spread of the Wuhan coronavirus fanned worries of a deeper economic slowdown in parts of the country.
The yuan traded at 6.9263 against the U.S. dollar in offshore trading Friday afternoon in Hong Kong, after declining around 1% this week. Onshore, the currency fell by a similar magnitude before Chinese markets closed Jan 24 for a weeklong holiday.
The currency's slide has erased recent gains it chalked up after the U.S. in mid-January removed China from a list of trading partners it considers currency manipulators. The signing of a first-stage trade deal between Beijing and Washington had also helped buoy the yuan.
China this week reported sharp increases in the number of people who have died or been sickened by a pneumonia-causing virus that was first identified in the central city of Wuhan in December. The government has imposed lockdowns on three major cities, stopping flights and shutting public transportation systems to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
The country was already contending with slower economic growth, and the yuan could come under more pressure if the viral outbreak worsens and crimps consumer spending, travel and business activity, strategists say. Already, many Chinese citizens have canceled or modified their travel plans during what is traditionally the country's busiest travel season.
"The bad news is that the worst has yet to come, as the number of new infections is still on the rise," said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Capital Ltd.
Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong, said some investors who profited from the yuan's recent climb have closed out their positions ahead of the Lunar New Year break. "They're wary of an escalation of confirmed cases after the holiday," he said.
Mr. Cheung said he expects the yuan to trade around 6.9 to the dollar as the market assesses the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on China's growth outlook and consumption patterns.
Back in 2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome -- caused by a similar but more deadly virus -- initially caused China's economic growth to slow, but the economy rebounded quickly later in the year after the disease's spread was brought under control.

Beijing " China locked down more than 35-million people in an increasingly urgent effort to halt the spread of the deadly coronavirus Friday, as the United States confirmed a second infected person and the respiratory illness found its way to Europe, where the first three cases were announced in France.
The pneumonia-like disease has claimed 42 lives " all in China " and infected more than 1,200 people there. An official at the World Health Organization told reporters that his agency has begun planning for an outbreak that will last for months.
Infections have been confirmed in South Korea, Japan, Nepal, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and Taiwan, as well as France, Australia and the United States as the disease spreads outside Asia.
At least 50 people are under observation for the illness in 22 U.S. states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The second U.S. patient is a woman, a Chicago resident, who traveled to Wuhan, China " where the virus originated " in late December and returned Jan.-13, the CDC announced Friday. A few days later, she began to feel ill and saw a doctor. She was asked about her travel history, then referred to a hospital, which isolated her and arranged for testing. 
The woman is in stable condition but will remain in the hospital mainly to ensure she does not spread the virus. On Tuesday, authorities revealed the first U.S. case, a man in his 30s from Snohomish County, Wash., who had recently returned from a visit to Wuhan. Authorities said they are monitoring 50 of the man's contacts for signs of infection.
The CDC deployed a team to help with the Chicago case. The woman 'has not had any extended close contact with anyone outside her home since returning, and that should be very reassuring to the public,' Allison Arwady, Chicago's public health commissioner, told reporters Friday. 
Health officials briefed about two dozen senators Friday. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he 'wouldn't be surprised if there are additional cases.' But he said public-health authorities acted quickly in Illinois, where they 'identified, isolated and did contact tracing on the people with whom that person came into contact. That's how you get your handle on an outbreak.'
After the briefing, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) called on President Trump to declare the outbreak a public-health emergency.
Although the outbreak is a 'very serious public-health threat, the immediate risk to the U.S. public is low at this time,' Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters in a briefing Friday.
Circumstances in the United States were overshadowed by the apparently deteriorating conditions in China. The Chinese medical system is struggling to cope with the outbreak, amid reports of overcrowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies.
A doctor who had been working on the front line of efforts to control the disease in Wuhan died Saturday, Chinese state media reported. Liang Wudong was 62 and had retired a year ago, according to staff at Hubei Xinhua Hospital, but was apparently called back to work to help combat the disease. He fell ill with suspected coronavirus on Jan.-16 before being transferred to another hospital in the city as a patient.
A ban on travel was extended to 14 cities, with a total population of more than 35-million in central China's Hubei province. Tunnels under the Yangtze River were blocked to stop the flow of traffic, and all ride-hailing services in Wuhan were halted at midday Friday. Only half the city's taxis are allowed on the road each day.
China Southern, the country's biggest airline, had already canceled flights in and out of Wuhan airport on Thursday. The other two main carriers, Air China and China Eastern, said they would cancel all Wuhan flights from Friday until at least Feb.-8.
As the Lunar New Year began, authorities have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that normally accompany the nation's biggest holiday. Large public gatherings could aid the spread of the airborne virus.
Nevertheless, state broadcaster CCTV led its midday news program with a report about a huge banquet in Beijing attended by President Xi Jinping and other Communist Party leaders. None of them was wearing a mask, and the report made no mention of the virus outbreak.
Other senior Chinese officials came under heavy criticism for their slow response to the outbreak. The mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, allowed a huge potluck banquet to proceed Sunday, during a weekend when the number of confirmed infections shot up dramatically. The city had arranged a Lunar New Year meal featuring 14,000 dishes for more than 40,000 people, an event it hoped to get listed in Guinness World Records.
Residents were also surprised by photos and video of the two top officials in Hubei province " the Communist Party secretary and the governor " at a dance performance in Wuhan to celebrate the arrival of the Spring Festival holiday. They were sharply criticized for enjoying themselves instead of working on the response to the health crisis.
The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice. Shanghai Disneyland, which normally has 10-million visitors a year, announced Friday that it would shut down indefinitely starting Saturday.
Production companies have postponed the release of seven films over the holiday, prompting Chinese cinema companies to close the country's 70,000 movie theaters.
Schools in Hubei province, due to begin the spring semester after the holiday, will not open their doors as planned but will wait for further guidance from health authorities. The Education Ministry instructed universities around China to delay their opening dates if necessary.
Workers are racing to build a 1,000-bed hospital for people with the disease in Wuhan, an indication that Chinese officials expect, or already have, a much larger number of cases. It is modeled after a medical facility specially built in 2003 for patients with SARS, another respiratory infection that began in China and claimed more than 750 lives in more than a dozen countries. The new virus is closely related to the SARS coronavirus.
China's state-run Xinhua News Agency said the new hospital is needed 'to address the insufficiency of existing medical resources.'
One of the most recent fatalities was a young, previously healthy man in Wuhan, raising concerns about the deadliness of the virus. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-viral medication and antibiotics since he was admitted to a hospital on Jan.-9.
Until now, the vast majority of victims have been older than 60 with underlying health conditions.
Aside from 1,287 confirmed cases of infection, a total of 8,420 people are reported to be under observation in China.
Despite the escalating toll, some analysts remained concerned that the Chinese government was significantly underreporting the number of cases. A financial analyst for the investment firm Raymond James told clients in a report Thursday night that he believes the numbers are likely at least 10 times the publicly reported total.
With transportation restrictions imposed by China, U.S. officials said Friday they are assessing the extent and duration of screening travelers from Wuhan to airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta and Chicago. The lockdown in Wuhan and nearby cities means fewer travelers from there are arriving in the United States.
The labor-intensive airport screening is being conducted by the CDC. But sick patients with no symptoms might not be detected.
To control the spread of the virus, resources must be focused at the state and local levels, where front-line health officials are trying to rapidly identify cases, said Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's division of global migration and quarantine.

New technologies and a spirit of openness have improved collaboration 
Just 10 days after a pneumonia-like illness was first reported among people who visited a seafood market in Wuhan, China, scientists released the genetic sequence of the coronavirus that sickened them. That precious bit of data, freely available to any researcher who wanted to study it, unleashed a massive collaborative effort to understand the mysterious new pathogen that has been rapidly spreading in China and beyond.
The genome was posted on a Friday night on an open-access repository for genetic information. By the next morning, Andrew Mesecar, a professor of cancer structural biology at Purdue University, had redirected his laboratory to start analyzing the DNA sequence, which bore a striking resemblance to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the 2002 viral outbreak that sickened more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health's Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Montana asked a company to turn the information from a string of letters on a computer screen into actual DNA they could study in lab dishes.
At unprecedented speed, scientists are starting experiments, sharing data and revealing the secrets of the pathogen " a race made possible by new scientific tools and cultural norms in the face of a public health emergency.
'The pace is unmatched,' said Karla Satchell, a professor of microbiology-immunology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. 'This is really new. Lots of people [in science] still try to hide what they're doing, don't want to talk about what they're doing, and everybody out there is like: 'This is like the case where we don't worry about egos, we don't worry about who's first, we just care about solving the problem.' The information flow has been really fast.'
Purdue University scientists are preparing to scale up production of experimental drugs they were initially developing to fight SARS, to see if they show promise against the new coronavirus. Twelve days after the genome was posted, NIH scientists published their first analysis, showing the coronavirus used the same door to get into human cells as SARS. About 12 hours later, a Chinese team of scientists who had isolated the virus from patients showed, using the actual virus, that the team was correct.
Meanwhile, a team at Northwestern recently ordered about a dozen pieces of the viral genome to be synthesized by a company to enable research that will help lead to drugs, vaccines and ways to rapidly diagnose the virus.
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview that with the viral genome, researchers have started on developing a vaccine. He is 'reasonably confident' that a safety study could begin testing it in people within three months.
'The fact that it's about three months is really, I think, remarkable, because that would be the fastest that we have ever gotten from the time we got the sequence to the time into a human,' Fauci said. 'If we can do that, it would be the fastest on the record.'
He cautioned that doesn't mean a vaccine would be widely available in three months; larger studies would be required to determine both the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine. But it is still science at light speed; during the SARS outbreak, it took 20 months from getting the virus to genome to the first tests of a vaccine in people.
When SARS began to spread, the tools scientists needed were much less mature, including the infrastructure for sharing results rapidly so anyone could build on them. It wasn't until 2013 that bioRxiv, a preprint server to share scientific papers, was created so scientists would have an easy way to widely share results before they had been vetted and accepted by scientific journals " a process that can take many months.
'This is one of the first times we're getting to see an outbreak of a new virus and have the scientific community sharing their data almost in real time,' said Michael Letko, a postdoctoral fellow at Rocky Mountain Laboratories.
Mesecar said the speed of science would have been almost unthinkable when researchers were working on SARS.
'Imagine walking from Chicago to San Francisco, and then imagine taking a plane from Chicago to San Francisco. That's kind of the difference,' Mesecar said.
He hopes revealing the secrets of the virus will help calm the spreading panic. He noted influenza sickens and kills large numbers of people in the United States and globally each year, but doesn't trigger a panic because the risks are understood and a vaccine exists.
'When you don't understand something, you panic. You have fear. When you gain an understanding, you don't fear something as much " you know how it's going to operate,' Mesecar said. 'By sharing that information faster …both research as well as what's happening on the ground with individuals, I'm hoping that panic and that fear are going to go down.'

Such extreme efforts are difficult to enforce, can sow mistrust
China's quarantine of more than 35 million people, almost certainly the largest in modern public-health history, is surprising and troubling experts who said such drastic restrictions rarely work and often backfire.
In the United States, mandatory limits on movement for people in whole cities or regions have received little serious consideration in planning for disease outbreaks like the coronavirus infection now sweeping across China, according to public-health authorities and a review of government reports.
'This is just mind-boggling: This is the mother of all quarantines,' said University of Michigan medical historian Howard Markel. 'I could never have imagined it.'
Cordoning off a region like China's Hubei province pens the sick together with the uninfected. It increases the burden on authorities, who must ensure the flow of food, water and other supplies to the quarantined area. It is nearly impossible to enforce. And it sows distrust in government at a time when public support is essential, prompting people to evade the restrictions or refuse to report their symptoms, experts said.
'The first and golden rule of public health is you have to gain the trust of the population, and this is likely to drive the epidemic underground,' said Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. 'The truth is those kinds of lockdowns are very rare and never effective.'
From a practical standpoint, 'where does one draw the line?' asked Leana Wen, the former health commissioner for the city of Baltimore. 'Many people work in the city and live in neighboring counties, and vice versa. Would people be separated from their families? How would every road be blocked? How would supplies reach residents?'
'We worked on numerous contingency plans to respond to outbreaks and other public-health crises,' she added. 'To my knowledge, our health department had not considered a citywide quarantine.'
With 42 people confirmed dead and more than 1,200 infected, China has cut all transportation links into and out of Wuhan " a city of 11 million where the new virus originated " and 13 other cites across the center of the country, as celebrations of the Lunar New Year began Friday. Normally, 400 million people could be expected to travel across Asia during the Spring Festival, but the government has adopted a drastic course of action in the face of the health crisis.
'They're doing it because people who are in political leadership always think that if you do something dramatic and visible that you'll gain popular support,' Gostin said. 'They couldn't have any sound public health advice.'
The Chinese may gain some advantage from the quarantine if it helps reduce travel and increases 'social distancing,' a reliable tactic in the spread of infectious disease that means keeping people apart as much as possible, said Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
'Like many things, it depends on how you do it,' Frieden said. 'Cordoning off a city would have a positive impact if that reduces travel and the amount of mixing you have.' 
Recent quarantine attempts have met with little success. During the Ebola epidemic of 2014, an attempt to cordon off the West Point slum in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, sparked violent clashes and evasion of the lockdown, including by residents who bribed their way in and out. During the same crisis, Sierra Leone locked down most of its population for three days, which may have led to underreporting of symptoms.
But a five-day shutdown of businesses across Mexico may have helped slow the spread of the H1N1 swine flu there in 2009.
More than a century ago, authorities tried but quickly abandoned partial quarantines of Philadelphia and Chicago during the 1918 flu pandemic that killed as many as 40 million people worldwide and more than a half-million in the United States.
During the second wave of that epidemic, however, a few tiny communities, such as a naval base in San Francisco Bay and the mining town of Gunnison, Colo., were able to block the flu by voluntarily cutting off all contact with the outside world, according to a 2006 study led by Markel. 
Quarantining millions of people may be easier in an authoritarian country like China. But even in the United States, authorities have broad power to order quarantines as a last resort. In a 2007 report to the CDC on responding to a flu pandemic, an expert panel makes no recommendation to use mandatory lockdowns, even in the most severe, or 'Category 5' outbreak " one in which an astronomical 2-percent of those diagnosed with an infection die. 
Rather, the report says authorities should rely on voluntary isolation of the sick at home; voluntary quarantine at home of uninfected people with sick family members; limiting activities in schools; limiting or banning mass gatherings; social distancing; and encouraging people to work from home. 
These would be added to typical public-health measures such as surveillance of the spread of the disease and tracing the contacts of sick people.
In 2006, the Homeland Security Council and the CDC released a 233-page strategy that warned a modern pandemic could kill as many as 200,000 to 2 million Americans. 
The unlikely use of 'geographic quarantine' would result in 'the detention, within an epidemic zone, of persons who may or may not have been exposed to the pathogen in question,' according to the report.
But the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza noted that a virus is likely to quickly surface in more than one location. When that occurs, the success of a geographic quarantine would be 'profoundly limited,' effectively making it a remote option for curbing a pandemic. 
'The implementation of conventional geographic quarantine imposes significant opportunity costs and may result in the diversion of significant resources and assets that might be used to better effect supporting less draconian disease-containment measures,' according to the report. 
Still, the document called on state and local governments to devise their own pandemic strategies that at least include the possibility of a widespread quarantine " one that would probably be ordered by state or local governments and enforced by National Guard troops if necessary.
'If directed by the President pursuant to the Insurrection Act, the military may suppress domestic unrest associated with resistance to a state quarantine,' the document stated, referring to the 1807 law that outlines presidential power to combat domestic unrest.
States have developed their own plans for responding to pandemics. A 2014 report by the Illinois Department of Public Health declares that the state has 'absolute authority in matters of quarantine and isolation, and may declare and enforce quarantine when none exists.' 
But the document says the practice would most likely be used only in highly localized settings, such as restricting the movements of a group of nursing home residents or airline passengers who may have been exposed to a disease but are not yet symptomatic. 
'Quarantine . . . is not effective in controlling multiple influenza outbreaks because the disease spreads too rapidly to identify and to control chains of transmission,' it states. But like the Homeland Security report, Illinois' strategy appears to keep the door open for a more widespread use of quarantine in extreme circumstances.

American Airlines Group Inc.
Worries about a mysterious pneumonia-like virus are circulating through the airline industry as more people in China choose not to travel . Typically hundreds of millions visit family or take a vacation during the Lunar New Year holiday. This year many are staying closer to home due to the coronavirus, part of a class of pathogens that cause a range of respiratory illness. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus tripled Monday and accelerated through the week. Shares of American Airlines fell 4.2% Tuesday.
Starbucks Corp.
First Starbucks tossed its plastic straws. Now it wants to cut its water use and the amount of trash it sends to landfills over the next decade, the latest big company to set fresh targets for limiting its environmental impact . Starbucks said Tuesday it will aim to serve more coffee in reusable cups, curb food and packaging waste and set a more environmentally friendly menu. New stores will make more efficient use of energy and water, and the company plans to improve environmental practices among its coffee growers and other suppliers. Shares fell 1.2% Tuesday.
Uber Technologies Inc.
Uber might give drivers the green light to set their fares . Drivers who ferry passengers from airports in Santa Barbara, Palm Springs and Sacramento can charge up to five times the fare Uber sets on a ride, a test that began Tuesday. The experiment is part of Uber's effort to strengthen its case that its drivers operate with some degree of independence. Earlier this month, Uber capped its commissions on rides across California. Last month, it allowed drivers in the state to see where riders were going, letting them choose the trips they wanted to take. Shares gained 7% Tuesday.
Netflix Inc.
Foreign features are now in vogue at Netflix, where an overseas expansion is providing more new streaming subscribers as the U.S. slows. Netflix said Tuesday that it added 423,000 domestic subscribers in quarter, lower than its forecast of 600,000. It beat its expectations for subscriber growth overseas . The streaming giant faces heightened competition from a gaggle of domestic rivals including Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+ streaming platform and Apple Inc.'s Apple TV+. This spring, Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal and AT&T Inc.'s WarnerMedia plan to introduce their direct-to-consumer streaming services: Peacock and HBO Max, respectively. Shares fell 3.6% Wednesday.
Express Inc.
The fashion retailer said it would close about 100 stores by 2022 , including nine stores that closed last year and 31 that will close by the end of the month. The store closures are part of a broader overhaul, as the company anticipates $80 million in cost cuts over the next three years, including $55 million primarily related to job cuts it disclosed last week. It is cutting 10% of the positions at its Columbus, Ohio, headquarters and its design studio in New York City. Express also said it is planning to relaunch its loyalty and private-label credit card this fall as part of the effort. Shares gained 21% Tuesday.
Match Group Inc.
Online dating now has an alarm. Tinder plans to start offering users an option to hit a panic button, receive check-ins and summon authorities to their location. To offer the service, Tinder parent company Match Group is taking a stake and board seat in an app called Noonlight that tracks users' locations and notifies authorities if safety concerns arise. Tinder plans to debut the feature free for U.S. users at the end of January. Match Group didn't disclose the size of the investment. Shares fell 1.2% Thursday.
Intel Corp.
Intel Corp.'s customers are clearly hungry for more chips . The company posted strong fourth-quarter earnings that benefited from an upswing in personal-computer shipments and robust demand for server farms that need chips to store large amounts of data. The results are the latest sign technology companies expect healthy demand at the start of this year despite wider expectations for only a modest economic rebound this year. Still, Intel is facing challenges, including chip supply shortages, loss of market share and turmoil from the U.S.-China trade tussle. Intel shares rose 8.1% Friday.

U.S. Crude Suffers Worst Week Since July as Virus Fear Spreads; Brent oil's 6.4% drop is steepest weekly fall since 2018

Oil prices suffered their worst week in over a year, dragged lower by fears that a deadly new coronavirus spreading throughout China and other countries will weigh on economic growth and hurt demand for crude.
Brent, the global gauge of prices, fell 6.4% this past week to notch its biggest weekly percentage decline since December 2018. U.S. crude futures fell 7.5%, marking their largest weekly loss since July.
Crude prices were hit this week after reports of the emergence of a deadly new respiratory virus in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. The second U.S. case was confirmed by health officials on Friday and the disease spread into Europe and Australia for the first time.
"The virus has significant potential to take a lot of demand off the market," said Robert Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA.
On Friday, Brent declined 2.2% to $60.69 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate futures fell 2.5% to $54.19 a barrel, with some analysts saying the virus had already begun denting oil demand.
Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, pointed to Beijing's lockdown of Wuhan and nearby cities during a time when many families would normally be traveling for Lunar New Year festivities.
"Many of the Lunar Day festivities have been canceled along with flights due to airport closures and trains shutting down," he wrote in a note. "That will eventually add up to hundreds of thousands of unused barrels of jet fuel, diesel and gasoline."
The virus is the latest blow to U.S. crude-oil prices, which have fallen more than 11% so far this year. Investors are worried that there is too much oil in the world, despite recent production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that could tamp down supply and a limited trade agreement between the U.S. and China that could spur demand.
Low prices have persisted even through shocks that many expected would break them from their rut. Crude shot up 15% in mid-September, after an attack on Saudi Arabian production facilities, but returned to pre-attack levels in less than two weeks. In early January, prices spiked after the president ordered an airstrike that killed a powerful Iranian general, but fell past their pre-attack levels soon afterward.
More recently, futures rallied earlier this past wee k after a rebel group in Libya blocked a significant portion of the country's crude exports, but prices have since fallen, highlighting investors' concerns of a supply glut.
In another sign of caution, bets by hedge funds and other speculative investors on rising U.S. crude prices have fallen from a recent peak hit earlier this month.
News of the virus largely overshadowed Thursday's inventory report from the Energy Information Administration. U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 400,000 barrels the week ended Jan. 17, according to the EIA, more than the 300,000-barrel drop that analysts and traders surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected.
"The bullish EIA report was steamrolled by demand concerns surrounding coronavirus," said Mr. Yawger.
Elsewhere in commodities, front-month copper futures had their worst week since November 2014, falling 5.8% on worries that the coronavirus would hit industrial activity in China and reduce demand for base metals. The price of copper fell 1.5% to $2.6855 a pound on Friday.
The price of natural gas fell to its lowest level since March 2016, driven down by a supply glut and persistent warmer-than-usual winter weather across the U.S. that has tamped down demand. Natural-gas futures slipped 1.7% to $1.893 per million British thermal units on Friday.
Natural-gas stockpiles fell by 92 billion cubic feet last week, according to the EIA. Analysts and traders surveyed by the Journal had been expecting an 88-billion cubic foot withdrawal, though total inventories are still around 9% higher than the five-year average.

Union Pacific Corp. is banking on shrinking its way back to profit growth. The freight railroad says it will cut nearly 3,000 jobs in 2020, the WSJ's Paul Ziobro reports, adding to the rapid decline of rail payrolls over the past year as shipping volumes have fallen and carriers have implemented the lean operating strategy known as precision railroading. Union Pacific is transforming its operations, and the railroad now plans to cut its workforce by around 8% this year after reductions of 11% in 2019. Financial returns so far are mixed. Union Pacific's fourth-quarter net profit fell 10% as operating revenues tumbled 9%. Freight volumes fell a bit more, however, and a key measure of pricing power increased 1.4%. Union Pacific's trains also moved faster and spent less time at terminals, giving the railroad hope that financial gains will come along soon.
SUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES
A new report suggests the boom in North American warehousing may have peaked. Cushman &Wakefield PLC projects that warehouse construction is likely to outstrip demand over this year and next, the WSJ's Micah Maidenberg writes, suggesting a market long marked by tight capacity and rising rental rates may be shifting to favor tenants . The real-estate firm expects builders to deliver 301 million square feet of distribution space in 2020, and another 272 million square feet next year. Both figures are well ahead of demand projections, capping a turnaround in the market that has been boosted by surging e-commerce sales and a push by retailers to find new warehousing sites. Softer leasing rates would bring some relief to companies that have been stung by the high costs of digital strategies. Vacancy rates remain very low, however, and capacity for new sites near population centers is still hard to find.
ECONOMY &TRADE
The impact of China's rapidly-spreading coronavirus is starting to touch commercial trade. Authorities are holding back some ships from calling at the city of Wuhan, the WSJ Logistics Report's Costas Paris writes, extending efforts to quarantine the region into the shipping sector . The moves at the major trading center on the Yangtze River add to the concerns that the frightening respiratory infection will begin to affect China's economy. Beijing has expanded the lockdown on travel in the central Chinese city of Wuhan to other nearby cities, a crushing event for Chinese citizens just at the start of the Lunar New Year, when millions of people travel home for the country's most important family holiday. The efforts at the river ports have so far kept some cargo ships idling short of Wuhan, and one official says container ships are taking health precautions as they enter the area.

Rémy Cointreau Offers Investors a Dry Few Months; Sales in the U.S. and Asia were weaker than feared in the last months of 2019, and shareholders won't get much clarity until the summer

For the world's most exclusive liquor company, the party has fizzled out.
Rémy Cointreau, which specializes in top-shelf cognacs, blamed a dismal end to 2019 on a series of one-offs. It won't be clear whether the problems go deeper until the new boss lays out his strategy in June.
Shares in the Paris-listed liquor business lost one-tenth of their value in early trading Friday. Sales fell 11.3% over the three months through December, stripping out the impact of exchange rates and portfolio changes. Analysts expected weak results, but thought sales would dip just 6%.
Rémy has problems in all its big regions. Chinese visitors are staying away from Hong Kong because of political unrest, depriving the cognac maker of particularly high-margin sales. Tourists from the mainland tended to buy expensive bottles of Rémy Martin Louis XIII—which sell for $4,000 and upwards—as they made their way through the city's airport.
The U.S. was also weak as retailers prioritized stocking up on Hennessy, the country's number one cognac. LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which owns the brand, increased its prices last year and trade tariffs threatened to raise the cost even further. Although cognac wasn't hit by levies related to the trans-Atlantic dispute over aircraft subsidies, French imports are still vulnerable to new tariffs if Washington and Paris can't resolve their differences over how to tax tech companies.
In Europe, switching to new distributors is causing disruption. Rémy wants to work with partners that feed into high-end bars and restaurants rather than those that supply large supermarkets.
Compounding investors' unease, the company decided not to give sales guidance for the full year. Clarity won't come until Rémy's new Chief Executive Eric Vallat lays out his plans this summer. In the meantime, an outbreak of coronavirus in China may slow demand for cognac in the country's bars and nightclubs, where around 45% of Rémy's Chinese sales happen.
Even after Friday's share price fall, Rémy Cointreau's shares look expensive. Thanks to more luxurious brands, the stock trades at a 20% premium to its European liquor peers Diageo and Pernod Ricard, based on multiples of projected earnings. With months of uncertainty ahead, more investors may be tempted to trade down to the cheaper names.

Yuan Falters as China Battles Wuhan Virus; Slide erases recent gains chalked up after the U.S. removed China from list of currency manipulators

China's currency weakened ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, as the widening spread of the Wuhan coronavirus fanned worries of a deeper economic slowdown in parts of the country.
The yuan traded at 6.9263 against the U.S. dollar in offshore trading Friday afternoon in Hong Kong, after declining around 1% this week. Onshore, the currency fell by a similar magnitude before Chinese markets closed Jan 24 for a weeklong holiday.
The currency's slide has erased recent gains it chalked up after the U.S. in mid-January removed China from a list of trading partners it considers currency manipulators. The signing of a first-stage trade deal between Beijing and Washington had also helped buoy the yuan.
China this week reported sharp increases in the number of people sickened by a pneumonia-causing virus that was first identified in the central city of Wuhan in December. The government has imposed lockdowns on three major cities , stopping flights and shutting public transportation systems to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 800 people and killed 25.
The country was already contending with slower economic growth prior to the outbreak, and the yuan could come under more pressure if the viral outbreak worsens and crimps consumer spending, travel and business activity, strategists say. Already, many Chinese citizens have canceled or modified their travel plans during what is traditionally the country's busiest travel season.
"The bad news is that the worst has yet to come, as the number of new infections is still on the rise," said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Capital Ltd.
Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong, said some investors who profited from the yuan's recent climb have closed out their positions ahead of the Lunar New Year break. "They're wary of an escalation of confirmed cases after the holiday," he said.
Mr. Cheung said he expects the yuan to trade around 6.9 to the dollar as the market assesses the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on China's growth outlook and consumption patterns.
Back in 2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome—caused by a similar but more deadly virus—initially caused China's economic growth to slow, but the economy rebounded quickly later in the year after the disease's spread was brought under control. SARS ended up killing 774 people world-wide and infecting more than 8,000 people, mostly in China.
Last August, Beijing let the yuan weaken beyond 7 per dollar for the first time in more than a decade, during a time of heightened trade tensions. The Chinese currency touched a low of nearly 7.2 in early September and has broadly strengthened since. The country last week reported GDP growth of 6.1% for 2019, its slowest growth rate in decades but within a range it earlier forecast.

Not as infectious as measles, not as deadly as SARS or Ebola. But it's early.

Health officials stress that much is unknown, virus behavior can shift
Global health officials have almost as many questions as answers about the mysterious, pneumonia-like virus that originated in China last month and has spread to at least five other countries, including the United States. How exactly is it transmitted? How infectious is it and, most critically, how deadly?
They do know that the new virus is believed to have come from animals sold in a Wuhan market and that it shares many similarities with SARS, the coronavirus that also originated in an animal-to-human transmission in China in 2002, though it does not appear to be as deadly.
Similar to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which infected more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 before it was mostly contained in 2003, the new virus spreads through close person-to-person contact. Each infected person seems to spread the virus to about two others, through coughing or sneezing or by leaving germs on a surface that is touched by non-infected people who touch their faces, said Colleen Kraft, who is associate chief medical officer for Emory University Hospital and helped treat the first U.S. Ebola cases in 2014.
The latest report from Chinese health authorities put the death toll from the new coronavirus at 25, with 830 confirmed cases nationwide.
Still, it is not nearly as infectious as the measles virus, which can live for up to two hours in the air after an infected person coughs or sneezes. Nor does it appear to be anywhere near as deadly as Ebola, which is also much harder to transmit. Ebola is passed largely through direct contact with an infected person's blood or bodily fluids.
Yet Kraft and global health officials from the World Health Organization cautioned that understanding of the novel virus is still evolving and that the way it spreads and infects people could also change over time.
'The transmission is going to be the same as other respiratory viruses,' Kraft said. 'Whether it's more severe in a person or lasts longer on the surface, those are things that can change. As we learn those things, we can gauge what our panic mode needs to be.'
The WHO on Thursday said it was still too early to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency " a step the international body ultimately took for Ebola in 2014 and Zika in 2016.
Coronaviruses range from the common cold to more-severe diseases such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS. Some coronaviruses, including this new one, can cause severe symptoms and illnesses, including pneumonia.
Yet because there are still so many unknowns, there are many scenarios of how this virus could spread, said Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
An unlikely possibility is that it can be transmitted as readily as the common cold and cause severe pneumonia in a small fraction of people, Frieden said. 'That seems quite unlikely, but it would be alarming because it could become like a circulating strain of flu all over the world,' Frieden said.
Another possibility: The virus spreads like SARS " in other words not as readily as the flu " but causes less severe illness than that sister virus. 'That would be concerning but not as alarming, and potentially more controllable,' he said. 
There is no vaccine or treatment for this coronavirus, but the National Institutes of Health said human trials for a coronavirus vaccine could begin within three months. It is spreading in health-care settings, which officials say is also cause for concern.
'Many things are giving us an advantage, but our disadvantage is the unknown " not fully understanding the disease, its severity and its transmission,' Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program, said at a news conference Thursday.

Global markets droop as China expands its efforts to contain lethal disease

Anxiety spreads as virus appears to have jumped national borders
Wall Street stumbled Thursday amid fears that efforts to curtail a lethal virus in China could further disrupt the global economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 200 points before recovering to close at 29,160.09, down 26 points for the day, following China's decision to expand its quarantine beyond Wuhan, where the virus first appeared. Oil prices also dipped again as traders anticipated global slowing.
The unprecedented lockdown of a provincial capital of 11-million people and several other cities showed Chinese authorities are belatedly ramping up efforts to head off a potential pandemic. The virus has killed at least 25 and sickened more than 600 in China.
And reported cases in Singapore and Vietnam show that the illness, which causes flulike symptoms, has probably jumped national borders.
Overnight, China's CSI 300 index lost more than 3-percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng surrendered more than 1.5-percent, and Seoul's KOSPI gave up 0.9-percent. Trading screens Thursday glowed red as losses spread to European markets and the United States. 
'This disruption comes at a time when Chinese economic growth already looks fragile, and it will unfortunately undo some of-the boost in consumer and business sentiment from the China-U.S. trade deal,' said economist Eswar Prasad, former head of the International Monetary Fund's China unit. 'A broader spread of this disease has the potential to disrupt travel, trade and supply chains throughout Asia, with knock-on effects on the world economy, since Asia is now a key driver of global growth.'
The Wuhan coronavirus appeared on the eve of the Chinese Lunar New Year, an annual festival that sees hundreds of millions of people travel to their hometowns for family celebrations.
The quarantines already announced " and those that may follow " are certain to dent spending on airlines, railways, hotels, restaurants and other parts of the consumer sector that Chinese officials have been seeking to develop.
'This couldn't have come at a worse time,' said Jorge Guajardo, former Mexican ambassador to China.
On the Yangtze River, Wuhan is a key transport hub for goods moving from China's interior to the coast, as well as for north-south commercial traffic.
The city reflects China's role at the center of pan-Asian supply chains for electronics, pharmaceuticals and automobiles.
Manufacturers have rushed to get shipments out before the New Year festivities. Government officials will use this annual break to control the outbreak while factories are idle during the roughly three-week holiday.
'Any serious transportation shutdown has the potential to interrupt supply chains,' said Phil Levy, chief economist for Flexport, a freight forwarder. '[But] it will make a big difference to economic impact how long this virus threat lasts.'
The flulike ailment adds to worries over the global economy. This month, the IMF trimmed its 2020 growth forecast to 2.9-percent from 3-percent, citing weakness in emerging markets such as India.
Chinese officials, meanwhile, must battle the unexpected health crisis and implement the terms of a new U.S.-China trade deal. The accord requires China to increase its spending on U.S. goods and services by $200-billion over the next two years and begin opening its financial services market by April-1.
'That could be a major distraction,' said Scott Kennedy, a China specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'Meeting targets in the trade deal would fade in comparison to managing the domestic politics and economics of this crisis.'
Previous health scares offer reasons for investor concern, at least in the short run. In 2014, an Ebola outbreak in West Africa knocked U.S. markets off course as investors worried about a chilling effect on consumer spending. The Dow fell nearly 7-percent from mid-September to mid-October that year.
Likewise, in 2003 as Chinese authorities struggled to curb the fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, the MSCI China Index plunged by more than 10-percent. SARS ultimately was responsible for the deaths of 774 individuals worldwide, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The economic hit from SARS was more lasting, according to a study by economists Jong-Wha Lee of Korea University and Warwick McKibbin of the Australian National University. In a 2004 paper, they found that the virus carved more than 1-percent from China's economic output and 2.6-percent from Hong Kong's.
Fallout from the disease would continue to dampen activity and marginally depress investment in China and Hong Kong for the next decade, the study predicted.
But markets rebounded swiftly as SARS was brought under control, indicating that in most such cases any financial damage is short-lived, Oliver Jones, senior markets economist with Capital Economics in London, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.
Still, China already is burdened by soaring government debt, meaning officials are less able to offset any economic damage with tax cuts or increased spending.
China also accounts for twice as great a share of the global economy as it did in 2003, 'meaning there is greater scope for events there to set the tone in global markets,' Jones added.
Official measures to blunt the disease also are likely to be heavy-handed and disruptive, according to Guajardo, who was Mexico's ambassador to China during a 2009 outbreak of swine flu.
In that case, Chinese authorities concluded that the virus had originated in Mexico and responded with a draconian crackdown-on-all Mexican citizens regardless of whether they had recently visited their homeland, Guajardo said.
'It was awful. None of it was done scientifically,' Guajardo said.
Investors drew solace from a meeting of the emergency committee of the World Health Organization (WHO), which decided for now not to declare the Wuhan episode a public health emergency of international concern.
On Twitter, Patrick Chovanec, a China specialist and chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management, offered a chilling reminder of the worst-case risks.
'Behind everything WHO does is the specter of the 1918 global influenza epidemic, which killed an estimated 50-100-million people,' he wrote. 'That's the nightmare they're always thinking about.'

Several drugmakers are racing to develop vaccines that could protect against the new respiratory virus originating in China, as fears mount it could spread more widely.
Moderna Inc., Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Novavax Inc. said Thursday they plan to develop vaccines against the newly identified viral strain, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia are also trying to develop a vaccine against the strain.
Some of the experimental vaccines targeting the Wuhan virus could be ready for human testing in a few months, though approval for widespread use will take longer.
The research was triggered by the rapid spread of the virus, which has infected hundreds in China, killing more than a dozen people . Since first appearing in a meat-and-fish market last month, the virus has spread to other countries in Asia and a man in Washington state has been diagnosed, the first confirmed U.S. case.
There are no known vaccines or treatments approved specifically for the virus, dubbed nCoV-2019, which belongs to a family of coronaviruses responsible for outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, in recent years.
Without an available vaccine or treatment, U.S. government agencies have been mobilizing to limit the virus's spread. Certain airports are screening international travelers for fevers, and some state health agencies are urging doctors and hospitals to step up surveillance of patients for possible signs of the virus.
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health sent an alert to physicians and hospitals with guidance on the use of isolating rooms and collecting specimens from patients reporting travel to Wuhan. The Hawaii Department of Health also sent out information to health-care providers outlining interim infection-control measures.
The outbreak has lifted shares of vaccine makers, because investors see a new opportunity for the companies.
A Norwegian nonprofit, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said Thursday it is providing as much as $11 million in funding to Moderna, Inovio and the University of Queensland in Australia to develop vaccines against the strain.
CEPI Chief Executive Richard Hatchett said in an interview the group acted after concluding the geographic spread and human-to-human transmission of the virus could turn it into "a very serious epidemic."
Moderna, of Cambridge, Mass., is working on its vaccine with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. It could be ready for an early-stage clinical trial in about three months, though full testing and regulatory approval would take much longer, said Anthony Fauci, the institute's director.
"We don't see any confounding obstacles" to creating the vaccine, Dr. Fauci said. "The body is capable of making a good immune response. You can get a vaccine that can induce a similar response."
The NIAID-Moderna vaccine is based on molecular couriers, known as messenger RNA, which direct the body's cells to manufacture proteins that trigger an immune response to protect against a virus, said Moderna President Stephen Hoge. The NIAID will conduct initial studies of the vaccine, Moderna said.
The NIAID had developed a vaccine against the SARS coronavirus during an epidemic in 2002 and 2003, but the SARS vaccine was shelved after the epidemic ended, Dr. Fauci said. That virus hasn't reappeared since.
Inovio, of Plymouth Meeting, Pa., is developing what is known as a DNA-based vaccine to fight off infection from the Wuhan virus, Chief Executive Joseph Kim said in an interview. Inovio's vaccine will be made from DNA synthesized in a lab to resemble the genetic material from the Wuhan virus. Once injected, the vaccine is designed to spur a protective immune response to the virus. Inovio developed such a vaccine to combat Zika.
Dr. Kim said the company was able to quickly design a potential vaccine for the new coronavirus after health authorities made the genetic sequence available online earlier this month. Inovio's DNA-based technology doesn't require samples of the actual virus to develop a vaccine, he said.
"We've been working very rapidly to move our new vaccine through preclinical testing in the next few weeks, and into human testing in the U.S. as rapidly as possible," he said. Inovio could eventually test it in China as well, he said. Human testing could begin in the next few months, he said.
The University of Queensland project will try to develop a coronavirus vaccine based on technology known as molecular clamp, according to CEPI. With this technology, researchers engineer viral proteins and then clamp them into a shape designed to make it easier for the human immune system to recognize them and begin an immune response.
A spokeswoman for Novavax, of Gaithersburg, Md., said the company began working on its vaccine as soon as the genetic sequence was made available, and expects to take roughly three months to develop it
In addition to the vaccine work, researchers are also exploring whether existing antiviral drugs could treat the new coronavirus .
Gilead Sciences Inc. said Wednesday it has been in discussions with U.S. and Chinese researchers about the potential use of its experimental drug remdesivir as a potential treatment for the new virus. Gilead said remdesivir has been active against other coronaviruses in lab and animal studies.

U.S. Treasury Yields Extend Declines; Yields slide on concerns over spread of deadly virus in China

U.S. government yields extended a recent decline after concerns around the coronavirus outbreak in China drove investors to the relative safety of traditional havens.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note closed at 1.739%, according to Tradeweb, down from 1.768% on Wednesday. It dropped as low as 1.710% during trading hours.
Yields, which fall as bond prices rise, have declined in recent sessions following a leading Chinese health official's announcement that a newly identified virus was spreading across the country. U.S. stocks fell Thursday following the Shanghai Composite's biggest drop since May and commodities, including oil and copper, extended recent slides.
"The revelations that travel out of Wuhan has been banned and Lunar New Year celebrations canceled have undermined an otherwise resilient global equity market," Ian Lyngen, a U.S. government bond strategist at BMO, wrote in a note to clients.
The flight-to-quality accelerated after the Chinese government announced that two more Chinese cities were put on lockdown to contain the fast-spreading virus, which has infected more than 600 people and killed 17. Meanwhile, authorities in the Chinese gambling center of Macau said they were weighing closures of its casinos.
Investors are protecting portfolios by shifting into U.S. Treasurys, some analysts said, while examining past viral outbreaks to assess how bad the damage could be on the economy and markets this time around.
Some analysts say the move in Treasurys is relatively muted compared with other asset classes. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 2.8% Thursday.
Strategists at BlackRock Inc. noted that U.S. Treasurys offer protection against stock declines, citing their rallies during episodes where investors shied away from risk. But they say that other government bonds across the globe are losing their haven status.
"The cushion that government bonds provide against equity-market drawdowns gets thinner as yields decline," said strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute. "These limitations are most acute in Europe and Japan, where negative yields abound."

Impact of Past Virus Scares On Markets Worries Investors

HONG KONG -- Investors fixated on the mysterious pneumonia-causing virus that originated in China are looking to past viral outbreaks to assess how bad the damage could be on the economy and markets this time around.
Seventeen people have died, with more than 500 confirmed cases of the coronavirus that authorities say is spreading between people primarily through the respiratory tract.
Federal health officials said Tuesday a man in Washington state has the first case to be confirmed in the U.S.
Global investors fear the sickness could grow into a pandemic that cripples transportation, shopping, business meetings and weighs on economic growth.
The outbreak's timing also matters. China is entering one of its busiest travel periods leading up to the Lunar New Year holiday.
Luxury retailers, travel companies and casino stocks have been among those hardest hit this week. Wynn Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and MGM China Holdings all fell more than 5% Tuesday. Wynn and Las Vegas Sands fell further Wednesday, but MGM China rose.
Chinese drugmakers and face-mask manufacturers have benefited from the potential for greater demand.
On Wednesday, stocks stabilized somewhat as investors took solace in China's response to the situation. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 1.3%, recovering roughly half of Tuesday's loss. The Shanghai Composite edged up 0.3%.
Still, investors were concerned about how this will play out. "We're not doctors, but there is a downside case, which could get pretty concerning pretty quickly," said Timothy Moe, chief Asia-Pacific equity strategist at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong.
Outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002-03, the H1N1 influenza virus in 2009 and Ebola in 2014 suggest markets can fall short term on heightened volatility but tend to bounce back quickly, with some individual stocks benefiting.
Such episodes can cause real economic damage though.
SARS resulted in 774 deaths around the world from November 2002 through July 2003, with most of the deaths in mainland China and Hong Kong, according to the World Health Organization.
During that time, economic growth slowed in China. Hong Kong fell into a recession. Stock indexes in both places suffered double-digit percentage drops before bouncing back.
"The whole region was in its own personal panic that drove the decline in confidence, which in turn affected the economy,"said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.
Notably, markets in China, Hong Kong and the U.S. bottomed months before the SARS outbreak was officially contained.
Goldman's Mr. Moe said markets then traded largely on the number of cases that were reported daily.
Markets fell hardest when the pace of new cases accelerated, but ultimately bottomed once that rate started to slow. All three markets had fully recovered their losses by the time the WHO declared the SARS outbreak over.
Most markets in early 2003 were still depressed following the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the Asian financial crisis. The SARS outbreak added to the pain before stock markets bounced back.
More recently, markets in the U.S., China and Hong Kong rose last year and kicked off 2020 with more gains.
"The market broadly was set up for some sort of a shock like this," Mr. Moe said.
Notable decliners this week include U.S. and Chinese hotel operators such as Marriott International Inc. and Shangri-La Asia Ltd. and airlines such as Delta Air Lines Inc., Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, the parent of British Airways.
Casino operators, many of which depend on Chinese tourists, also dropped. Casinos are concentrated in Macau, where at least one case of the virus was found. The stocks' declines demonstrate how important Chinese consumers are to the global economy. Lunar New Year is the busiest travel season and the world's largest annual human migration.
Millions of Chinese travelers are estimated to visit families or go on vacation -- many abroad -- during the holiday.
"We didn't have high-speed trains back then in 2003, but now the nationwide network could help spread the virus at a rapid pace," said Kevin Lai, chief economist for Asia excluding Japan at Daiwa Capital Markets.

School calls off Chinese students' visit over virus

A Northern Virginia middle school canceled a seven-day visit by 21 Chinese students and their chaperones on the day they arrived in the United States because of fears over a new coronavirus circulating in China, according to a school letter emailed to parents Wednesday afternoon.
The students, who landed Wednesday in New York, had planned to take a bus to Longfellow Middle School in Fairfax County for the exchange program and meet with their host families Wednesday evening. But in the letter sent to families at the school, Longfellow Principal Carole Kihm said that the exchange trip was being altered 'out of an abundance of caution' and that the students would no longer visit the school.
'Student and staff health and safety remain our first priority,' Kihm wrote. 'While health officials believe the risk of illness transmission of the novel Coronavirus from these students is extremely low, we felt it necessary to make this adjustment.'
The visiting students are from Yichang, about 175 miles west of Wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected. Authorities in China reported Wednesday that 17 people have died from the infection, and more than 470 people are confirmed as having the pneumonialike illness. Yichang and Wuhan are in Hubei province, where almost all of the infections with the new coronavirus have been reported.
Fairfax County Public Schools and the Fairfax County Health Department initially sought to reassure parents that the students from China were extremely unlikely to have been affected by the virus. In an email sent to Longfellow families Tuesday evening, the school district and health department said that no cases of the coronavirus had been reported in Yichang and that Longfellow students would not be in jeopardy.
'Based on guidance from the Fairfax County Health Department, in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Virginia Department of Health, there is no increased risk in our school at this time,' the email stated.
But several parents at the school contacted Fairfax County Public Schools officials to express concern about the virus and about having the students visit.
During an emotional meeting at the school Wednesday morning, parents expressed doubts about how well officials were able to assess the risk, according to a parent who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. They asked for the trip by the visiting students to be canceled.
School officials moved Wednesday afternoon to cancel the trip and said they would try to arrange a program for the visiting students with the travel company to 'facilitate cultural and educational activities in the DC area so that the students enjoy a positive experience.'
Fairfax County Public Schools spokeswoman Lucy H. Caldwell said that the Chinese students will stay at an area hotel and that the school system 'is looking at ways to facilitate virtual instruction or interaction between the visiting students and Longfellow students.' The district did not provide any statement from the chaperones of the Chinese students about their reaction to the trip's cancellation.
Before the trip, the Chinese and American students had exchanged emails and photographs to get to know each other. One of the host family members, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, expressed 'great disappointment' that the trip had been canceled.

Wuhan focus of effort to contain coronavirus as cases rapidly increase
BEIJING " Chinese health authorities are trying to lock down Wuhan, the metropolis of 11-million people that is at the heart of a spreading coronavirus outbreak, in an extraordinary effort to stop new infections during the busiest travel period of the year.
All outbound trains and bus services from Wuhan " larger than any city in the United States " were suspended starting at 10-a.m. Thursday, causing chaos for some of the 400-million people hitting the road for the Lunar New Year holiday, which officially begins Friday. 
Armed police guarded the entrance to Wuhan's biggest railway station, less than a mile from the market where the virus originated, to stop people trying to get onto the last trains out of the city. 'Whatever train ticket I can get, as long as I can get out of Wuhan,' one would-be passenger at Han kou station told a local reporter early Thursday.
Health workers in hazmat suits checked the temperatures of passengers driving out of the city, while 200 of the 600-odd flights scheduled at Wuhan's international airport were canceled.
'Unless there are special reasons, citizens should not leave Wuhan,' the new Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Epidemic Prevention and Control Headquarters in Wuhan said in a notice announcing the travel ban.
At least 17 people have died, all of them in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, since the coronavirus broke out at the end of last month. More than 570 people nationwide, almost all of them in Hubei, have been confirmed as infected.
A handful of cases have been reported abroad, including in the United States, Japan and South Korea, but the World Health Organization (WHO) postponed a decision Wednesday on whether to declare a public health emergency.
Chinese health officials said they had ascertained that the virus started in an unsanitary food market that was selling wild and exotic animals for consumption. Snakes were the most likely cause of the virus, five Chinese scientists concluded in a paper published Wednesday in the Journal of Medical Virology.
It was unclear whether China's ramped-up response would actually halt the spread of the virus, and it drew mixed reactions from health experts.
'In past outbreaks, we haven't seen evidence that large-scale quarantine diminishes spread of disease,' said Tom Inglesby, director of the-Center for Health Security-at the-Johns Hopkins-Bloomberg School of Public-Health. 'It runs the risk of people losing confidence in government. And it places enormous responsibilities on government to make sure that people can continue to get food, basic necessities, medicines.'
The new restrictions could also make people more reluctant to report illness and might encourage them to escape the area of the quarantine, he said. 'I would focus on isolating the people who are sick.'
But WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised the decision to shutter one of China's major transportation hubs as 'a very strong measure' that would reduce mass gatherings that often spread infection.
'Taking the action they think is appropriate is very important,' he said in a news briefing Wednesday in Geneva. He added that as long as the response is 'tailored to the problem and the commitment we see, we commend their actions.' 
The agency's team in Wuhan would assess the impact on the ground, he said. 
Chinese state media struggled to keep its tally up to date Wednesday as new cases continued to be reported across the length and breadth of the country. The Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macao also confirmed their first infections, with Hong Kong reporting a second case early Thursday. Macao said it would cancel public celebrations planned to mark the new year this weekend.
The emergence of a new illness out of China has carried echoes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-(SARS)-epidemic, which sparked mass panic as it spread across more than two dozen countries over eight months after starting in China in November 2002. SARS caused an estimated $30-billion in economic losses, experts have said.
But with SARS, it took months to identify the cause " civet cats, a delicacy in southern China. In contrast, the virus in Wuhan was identified quickly and its genome sequenced and shared within days. Chinese health officials have confirmed that the pneumonia-like virus came from animals sold at a live-animal market in Wuhan.
Members of the Geneva-based WHO said in a briefing Wednesday that they were split on whether to issue an emergency declaration after listening to presentations from Chinese officials and others. The committee made recommendations to contain the virus both in China and other countries, and plans to meet again on Thursday, Tedros said.
The two factors determining such a designation are severity of illness and the extent and nature of the disease transmission, said Didier Houssin, a Russian infectious-disease expert who chairs the WHO's emergency committee on the coronavirus. 
'The committee felt it was a little too imprecise to suggest to [Tedros] to declare' an international public health emergency, Houssin said.
Officials said it's not unusual in outbreaks of respiratory illness for patients to become infected through close contact with family members and in health-care settings, as has happened in Wuhan. What matters is the route of transmission and whether authorities can track those contacts down, they said.
'There are still many unknowns,' said Michael Ryan, the WHO's executive director of health emergencies. 
He said that the patients who died in China tended to be older people, and that 40-percent had significant underlying medical conditions, a feature of previous coronavirus outbreaks. 
He noted that all viruses change but that this one is showing stability. 'We're not seeing huge changes in the viral genomic sequence,' he said.
President Trump said from Davos, Switzerland, where he was attending the World Economic Forum, that Americans have nothing to worry about because there was only a single case in the United States so far. 'It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control,' he said.
But at least so far, the virus has defied control in China.
'At present, during the Spring Festival travel rush, the number of people on the move has surged, which has increased the risk of an epidemic and the difficulty of preventing and controlling transmission,' National Health Commission Vice Director Li Bin said Wednesday, using the Chinese name for the holiday.
Highlighting the difficulties of the response effort, Wang Guangfa, a member of the National Health Commission's expert group that traveled to Wuhan to investigate the outbreak, was among the infected. He wrote in a social media post that he thought he contracted the virus through his eyes because he had been wearing a mask. But, he said, he was responding well to treatment.
The outbreak could hardly come at a worse time. Before the travel suspension in Wuhan, officials estimated that 3-billion trips would be made in China during the 40-day period around the turn of the Lunar New Year. It is a time notorious even in China for crowded trains and buses, conditions that are ripe for the airborne virus to spread.
Authorities had already mandated use of medical masks in public places. Across China, people raced to buy specific masks that can protect against the microbes. Many physical and online stores had sold out on Wednesday, leading Taobao, the huge online marketplace, to ban its online vendors from raising mask prices to exploit the crisis.
One mask manufacturer in Zhejiang province said it received orders for 80-million masks in the space of a week and has had to call 100 workers back from their holidays and promise to pay them triple their usual salary. Still, the company has said it will not be able to meet demand.
'We should not take this situation lightly and should be on high alert,' Li said Wednesday in a news conference called by central government authorities to allay concerns after confirmation that the virus could be spread between humans.
Wuhan, which straddles the banks of the Yangtze River, is a major transport hub for trains, planes and ships.
Some 27-million passengers traveled through Wuhan Tianhe International Airport last year. The airport is among those that offer six-day visa-free entry into China, part of an effort to encourage foreign tourists to stop over on their way to other countries. International destinations that are reachable by direct flights from Wuhan include New York, San Francisco, London, Paris and Moscow.
Planes bound for Anchorage, Rome and Tokyo took off as usual Thursday morning.
The airport in Wuhan is also one of the busiest for domestic aviation, sitting at the intersection of the Beijing-Guangzhou and Shanghai-Chengdu air corridors. China Southern, the country's biggest airline, canceled all flights out of Wuhan, but smaller carriers continued operating many domestic routes.
With an expansion completed this month, the number of flights in and out of the airport had been expected to increase from 600 to 800 a day during the Spring Festival travel rush.
At the same time, China Railway's Wuhan branch had been expecting almost 25-million passengers to travel through its three main stations this Spring Festival, with a daily peak of about 920,000 rail passengers.

Travelers from Wuhan in China are being assessed at 5 American airports
Amid growing concerns about the spread of a new potentially fatal coronavirus, Chicago's O'Hare and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International airports on Wednesday became the latest in the United States to begin conducting expanded screenings of travelers arriving from Wuhan, China.
More than 1,200 people have been scrutinized since U.S. health officials began screening passengers at John F. Kennedy, Los Angeles and San Francisco international airports last week. No one has been found to have the virus or been hospitalized through the screenings. 
The virus has killed at least 17 people and sickened hundreds more. More than 470 people have fallen ill in China, and cases have been identified in Thailand, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. 
On Wednesday, authorities in Wuhan suspended all outbound travel beginning 10 a.m. Thursday, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.
Even with the virus's rapid spread, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they think this coronavirus presents a low risk to the American public. Even so, health officials characterized the enhanced screenings as 'proactive preparedness precautions.' 
President Trump, attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said that Americans have nothing to worry about because there was only a single case in the United States.
'It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control,' he said.
The person who was infected was identified as a man in his 30s, in Washington state, who had been visiting relatives in Wuhan. When he arrived back in Seattle, he reported feeling sick, called his doctor and was later hospitalized. Officials are monitoring him but said he is not considered seriously ill. He was not screened when he returned to the United States because he arrived before enhanced screenings began. 
In a statement, officials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the agency, in coordination with the CDC, has measures in place to identify travelers entering the United States who may show signs of illness and pose a risk to other members of the public.
However, the enhanced screening at the five airports will focus specifically on symptoms related to 2019-nCoV, also known as the coronavirus. CDC officials will screen passengers on their arrival, Customs and Border Protection said. Travelers will have their temperatures taken and those with high temperatures could undergo additional testing. While screening for a common virus usually takes only hours, health authorities said that people suspected of having the coronavirus could be delayed for up to a day for if additional testing is needed. The screening is being done in English and Mandarin.
As part of the enhanced screenings, travelers arriving from Wuhan on direct or connecting flights to the United States will be rerouted to one of the five designated airports. That means a passenger traveling from Wuhan who caught a connecting flight in Shanghai that would have landed in Boston would be likely to be rerouted to JFK for screening, CDC officials said. If that person is cleared, he or she would continue on to Boston.
The CDC, the Department of Homeland Security and transportation agencies are working out details about how travelers arriving in the United States will be redirected to the five airports. The rerouting is likely to create logistical challenges for airlines.
U.S. officials want to make sure that every time someone books a flight from Wuhan to the United States, the person's first point of entry is one of those airports, said the CDC's Martin Cetron, the director of agency's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. Only JFK and San Francisco airports have direct flights from Wuhan. The process is complex and will involve 'reissuing tickets and redirecting passengers all over the globe,' Cetron said.
U.S. carriers may not offer direct service between the United States and Wuhan, but some have partnerships with carriers that serve Wuhan. For example, United Airlines does not offer service to the affected area, but it has Star Alliance partners that do.
Officials at American Airlines said they remain in close contact with CBP and CDC and are coordinating with them on any required health or safety-related measures. American does not serve Wuhan directly, but China Southern, one of its Oneworld network partners does. Even so, the airline said it expects the rerouting will impact only a small number of connecting passengers. 
Coronaviruses are part of a large family of viruses that range from the common cold to more-serious respiratory diseases. The strain identified in China is related to two other coronaviruses that caused major outbreaks in recent years, Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.

A new coronavirus that has killed at least 17 people in China and spread to several other countries is already putting global measures designed to fend off epidemics to the test.
The looming question is whether the international community will try to stem its spread by implementing what it learned during the deadly outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, between 2002 and 2004, which also began in China. At the time, China denied the existence of the SARS virus, even as it spread across the country and abroad, eventually killing more than 770-people worldwide.
This time, Chinese authorities were initially praised for what some observers called a relatively fast response. China first reported a pattern of unknown pneumonia-like cases in the city of Wuhan in late December. It shared details about the virus " including its genetic sequencing " with other countries and revised its initial assessment that the virus is unlikely to spread between humans. Authorities have offered daily updates and have said the number of infected people in China has passed 470.
J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said it is clear that Chinese President Xi Jinping is trying to avoid a disaster that will implicate Chinese authorities in a coverup reminiscent of the SARS outbreak. Their response this time 'has been far superior and fundamentally different' compared with 2002 and 2003, Morrison said.
But some analysts have already raised doubts over whether the Chinese figures are accurate. Imperial College London researchers estimated Wednesday that the number of cases in Wuhan had probably risen to around 4,000 by Saturday " vastly exceeding the number of cases China had confirmed. The researchers did not accuse Chinese authorities of a deliberate coverup, suggesting instead that 'further refinements to case definitions and testing and further expansion of surveillance' could lessen the 'differences between our estimates and official case numbers.'
Still, these discrepancies reflect lingering skepticism over whether recent efforts to foster global cooperation on health epidemics have been sufficient and whether the world has learned its lessons from SARS.
In the fallout of the outbreak that began in 2002, the World Health Organization criticized a range of countries " including China, the United States and Canada " for not sharing sufficient information. But the lack of cooperation, researchers said, reflected deeper flaws at WHO as well.
By the time that outbreak hit, WHO had not significantly changed its regulations for three decades. SARS was a wake-up call, speeding up revisions.
'Over time, the shortcomings of the 1969 version of the [International Health Regulations] became increasingly apparent,' a WHO review committee acknowledged in 2011. Overall, the committee argued, the regulations were ill-equipped for the increasingly globalized world of 2003, when the SARS outbreak reached its peak.
The world has become more interconnected since then, raising concerns that high rates of movement in and out of China could raise the risk of the spread of this coronavirus as hundreds of millions of people prepare to travel for the Lunar New Year.
In 2003, the World Health Assembly also voted to grant WHO more authority to get involved in individual countries' responses to health crises. While the effort appeared largely directed against China, it was the United States that unsuccessfully attempted to delay the measures amid concerns that the changes might diminish the role of its Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Two years on, in 2005, the International Health Regulations " which outline WHO's authority and the rules it is bound by " were radically overhauled to reflect its expanded role. Whereas the rules previously required the reporting only of cases of yellow fever, the plague and cholera, they were revised to cover 'any event that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern,' or PHEIC.
Some experts have raised doubts over the extent to which some of those revisions were implemented. Kelley Lee, author of a book about WHO, said in an email that many countries still lag behind on their 2005 commitments to expand their capacity to respond to health emergencies.
WHO has not yet declared this latest outbreak a PHEIC, but Morrison said he expects it will, because it has spread so quickly to other countries, with one case diagnosed in the United States.
Countries do not always welcome such moves, because they 'do not want to be seen as losing control,' Morrison said.
In Congo, it took around a year for WHO to give a deadly, ongoing Ebola outbreak that designation, even after it infected more than 2,500 people and killed nearly 1,700. The delay drew criticism from many public health experts.
Even after the declaration, Robert Steffen, chairman of the WHO emergency committee, said the Congo outbreak 'is still a regional emergency and by no way a global threat.'
The emergency declaration came amid concerns Ebola had the potential to spread rapidly into neighboring countries, especially after a patient died in Goma, a city of 2-million on the border with Rwanda.
Still, efforts to control the outbreak, largely confined to Congo's North Kivu province, have proved difficult. The region has experienced decades of conflict, sowing deep distrust in the government. Armed groups have attacked clinics and killed several medical workers, increasing fears among people who might have already been reluctant to seek treatment.
But officials there also knew that the threat of a major international outbreak was less likely, Morrison said, because they were dealing with communities that are less likely to travel internationally by plane or have foreign visitors.
In Wuhan, a city of 11-million people, the numbers of people traveling in and out was 'staggering,' he said. And officials did not suspend travel until Wednesday, weeks after the outbreak was first documented.

Readiness for outbreaks has improved, experts say, but not enough
A Liberian man walked into a Dallas emergency room in September 2014, at the height of the West African Ebola epidemic, complaining of high fever, abdominal pain and other symptoms of the fearsome virus. He was sent home with acetaminophen and a diagnosis of a sinus infection. 
Two weeks later, Thomas Eric Duncan was dead, two nurses who attended him were infected with Ebola and the shortcomings of U.S. preparations for a viral epidemic were vividly exposed. 
Now, with word of the first U.S. patient to contract the new virus that has killed 17 people in China comes the inevitable question: Is the United States better prepared for the catastrophic outbreak authorities have long feared?
'The big picture,' said Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who oversaw the Ebola response, 'is that we're better prepared than we were before, but not nearly as prepared as we need to be.'
There is little doubt the country has made big leaps in preparedness since the anthrax scare of 2001, the SARS crisis in 2003, the MERS outbreak of 2014 and the West African Ebola epidemic that ended in 2016, according to experts and reports that evaluated the response to those crises. 
Twenty years ago, the nation had few programs or resources dedicated to coordinating the response to an outbreak among federal, state and local agencies and the hospitals that are the front-line protection against an epidemic, said Thomas V. Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 
Now, he said, agencies like the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, part of the Department of Health and Human Services; the CDC; the Defense Department; and the Department of Homeland Security have spent years and countless millions of dollars training, testing and coordinating with the nation's health-care facilities for just such an occurrence. 
Inglesby said he is confident that hospitals in the five cities that could receive passengers on flights from Wuhan, China " the epicenter of the outbreak " have been warned to be on alert. Under new precautions, anyone traveling from Wuhan will be funneled to airports in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago or Atlanta.
'In major hospitals in big cities, and definitely in the ones where flights will be landing from Wuhan, those people are very well aware of what's going on,' he said. 'It doesn't mean everyone in the country is properly trained, but the front line is.'
At Vanderbilt University Medical Center, front-line health-care workers who have long asked patients about travel to the Middle East as a way of screening for MERS are also raising questions about travel to China with anyone who complains of the respiratory problems and fever caused by the new virus. 
At UCLA and Emory University hospitals, nurses and doctors in the emergency room already ask open-ended questions about travel, officials said.
'I would think my colleagues in hospitals across the United States are doing something very, very similar,' said William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt School of Medicine. 
The stockpile of drugs and equipment such as ventilators has been expanded, Frieden said, and training for disease response in Asia and Africa has been stepped up. 
The science necessary to respond to an outbreak also has progressed rapidly. When the first U.S. patient in the current epidemic, a man in his 30s in Snohomish County, Wash., exhibited symptoms, the CDC was able to test specimens and confirm his diagnosis in 24 hours. The National Institutes of Health and other agencies are already working on a vaccine and treatments. And the Chinese rapidly sequenced the virus's genome, then distributed the information around the globe within weeks, Schaffner and other officials noted. 
Identification of the SARS virus in 2003 took months, and developing a reliable test for the virus took even longer.
But any system is only as good as the information fed into it, and Frieden pointed out in an interview Wednesday how little is still known about the new coronavirus. 
How were 14 health-care workers in China infected " from one incident or from numerous patients? Why are some patients in China asymptomatic? How long do the infections last? How many are severe? What characteristics do the 17 people who died share? 
'Large parts of the world have really bad diseases spreading that could bite us tomorrow and we don't know about it,' Frieden said.
At home, the list of deficiencies that could undermine a quick and effective response is lengthy. When an independent panel evaluated the U.S. response to Ebola in 2016, it found 'the U.S. government was not well prepared to respond to emergent crises that require a rapid, integrated domestic and international response.' It said U.S. officials 'did not demonstrate an appreciation of the public's perceptions and fear,' and even had trouble supplying enough of the protective suits health-care workers had to wear while treating Ebola patients.
When HHS's inspector general evaluated hospitals after the Ebola crisis, it found that 71 percent of administrators considered their facilities unprepared to receive Ebola patients in 2014 " a figure that had dropped to 14 percent by 2017.
The first U.S. coronavirus patient offers little evidence of how well the system responded. After returning from two months visiting family in Wuhan and developing symptoms on Jan. 16, he guessed he could have been infected by the virus and sought care at a clinic Jan. 19, John Wiesman, secretary of health for the state of Washington, said Wednesday. The patient appears to have a mild case of the infection. Health authorities said they are monitoring 16 people he came into contact with.
The next person may not be so healthy or well-informed. The question remains: What will happen when he or she walks through the doors of a health facility somewhere in the United States? 
'Well-trained and resourced health-care workers will be the key to detecting new cases, implementing infection control procedures " including isolating suspected ill individuals " and treating those who are ill,' said Alexandra L. Phelan, a faculty research instructor at Georgetown University's Department of Microbiology and Immunology. 
'The good news is there has been real progress globally, so progress is possible,' said Frieden, now president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a program aimed at preventing epidemics and saving lives from cardiovascular disease. 'The bad news is it takes a lot of time. This is not something that get fixed overnight.'

House Democrats, in the first day of opening arguments in the impeachment trial, said Trump's efforts to press Ukraine to launch investigations that could help him politically warranted his removal from office. 
Two U.N. officials said Washington Post owner Bezos was likely hacked using a WhatsApp account associated with the Saudi crown prince in a bid to influence news coverage of the kingdom.

Effort to quarantine hot-spot is complicated by huge holiday travel
BEIJING " Chinese health authorities sought to impose a- quasi-quarantine Tuesday around the hot spot of a mystery pneumonia-like virus that has now claimed nine lives in China and was confirmed in the United States for the first time.
The U.S. case " a man in his 30s under observation in Washington state " had links to the area of most concern in China: the commercial center of Wuhan about halfway between Beijing and Hong Kong.
In an attempt to contain the virus, Chinese authorities advised people in the city of 11-million not to leave. But the U.S. case showed how far the virus has moved beyond the Wuhan region.
U.S. officials said the man, a resident of Snohomish County, Wash., returned Jan.-15 from a trip to the region around Wuhan. Shortly after arriving at Seattle's international airport, he began feeling ill and got in touch with his health-care provider on Sunday.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Monday that the man had the coronavirus that has sickened more than 400-people in China and others in Thailand, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.
The Geneva-based World Health Organization said it would hold an emergency meeting Wednesday to decide whether to designate the outbreak as an international public health emergency.
The man was in stable condition at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Wash. Officials said they are monitoring him there out of an abundance of caution, not because he is seriously ill.
CDC officials said they were expanding screenings to international airports in Atlanta and Chicago. Measures were already in place at the international airports in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and at New York's John F. Kennedy International, the first such effort since the Ebola outbreak in 2014.
Federal officials will also direct travelers arriving in the United States on direct and indirect flights from Wuhan to those five airports for screening. That process is being worked out in the coming days. For example, if a passenger was originally to fly from Wuhan to Shanghai and then Boston, that flight would most likely be rerouted to JFK for screening, and then proceed to Boston, CDC officials said.
But the Washington state man arrived before the airport screenings began.
'This is an evolving situation, and again, we do expect additional cases in the United States and globally,' said Nancy Messonnier, the director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
In China, nine people, all of them in Wuhan, have now died from the virus, Li Bin, vice director of the National Health Commission, told reporters on Wednesday morning. 
'The virus has the potential to mutate and there is a risk it could further spread,' he said, adding that authorities were on 'high alert.'
A total of 440 people have been confirmed as having the infection, covering the length of the country. One case has been discovered in the territory of Macao and there are 117 suspected cases in Hong Kong, where authorities have banned the wearing of face masks as a result of recent protests.
With confirmation that the coronavirus could be transmitted person to person and wth hundreds of millions of people packing onto public transport to make their annual visits home for the Lunar New Year, a new sense of panic has set in.
Long lines formed at pharmacies and convenience stores around the country as people rushed to buy surgical masks, with unlucky customers posting photos on social media of bare shelves. People around the country canceled their trips home for the Spring Festival, as new year celebrations are known, the most important holiday on the Chinese calendar.
'I don't really dare to go to the airport right now, or even to the movie theater,' said Xie Jing, 33, who works in advertising in Shanghai, where two cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed. She canceled her planned trip home to Sichuan, where two cases are suspected.
'Everyone is being very careful at the moment in Shanghai. Everyone is wearing masks on the streets,' Xie said.
The virus was first detected Dec.-31 and was linked to a dirty food market in Wuhan, not far from one of the city's main train stations, where wild animals including wolf pups and civet cats had been on sale for consumption.
The Washington state man did not visit the Wuhan market and did not know anyone who was ill, U.S. officials said. The man was visiting relatives in the Wuhan area, U.S. officials said.
Initially, doctors thought the virus was not communicable between humans, but cases of infection across the country, including among people who have not been to Wuhan, indicated person-to-person infection.
Specialists are advising against travel in and out of Wuhan, which is in east-central China.
'We hope people can avoid going to Wuhan if possible and that people in Wuhan can stay there,' said Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the leader of a government team of experts responding to the outbreak. 'This is not a call from the officials but a suggestion from us in the expert team,' he said.
Still, Zeng said it was 'inevitable' that the virus would continue to spread as people moved around the country for the Lunar New Year on Saturday.
The Ministry of Transport estimates that 400-million people will be on the move, making a total of 3-billion trips in this period.
Health authorities added more infrared thermometers at Wuhan airport and train stations to check passengers for fever, and some hotels in the city also began requiring that temperatures be taken before customers could check in. Outbound group tours have been restricted.
Traffic police began conducting random checks on vehicles traveling in and out of the city to ensure they were not transporting live birds or wild animals.
Some airlines and travel agencies began offering refunds to people traveling out of Wuhan or people with the virus, and some hotels have allowed people to cancel their reservations without penalty. At least two airlines flying to Wuhan have stocked their planes with masks.
The measures come after criticism that Wuhan authorities have been lax in stopping the spread of the virus.
On Saturday, as the virus exploded in Wuhan, the city held potluck banquets to celebrate the looming holiday, with more than 40,000 families attending. News and photos of the event appeared Sunday on the front page of the state-run newspaper in Wuhan, but they were deleted from the Internet by Tuesday amid criticism about the lack of health precautions.
The city had still planned to go ahead with 41 large-scale events for holiday celebrations, advertising them on Monday, but it announced Tuesday that they have been 'postponed.' Schools and universities are on break for Spring Festival, but more than 100 extracurricular 'cram' schools in Wuhan have canceled classes.
Quarantine was the most effective way to prevent transmission of the virus, since it spreads by droplets from the nose and mouth, said Zhong Nanshan, the leader of a group of experts at China's National Health Commission.
'Now our big concern is if a super spreader emerges,' Zhong said Tuesday at a news conference in the southern province of Guangdong, using the term for a carrier who infects a disproportionately high number of people. A 'super spreader' is thought to have passed the virus on to 15 medical workers at a Wuhan hospital.
Although some hospitals have been stockpiling antibiotics, they are not effective against viruses. 'There's no specific drug to treat the infection at the moment,' Zhong said.
The Chinese CDC said the latest virus is the seventh type of coronavirus known to affect humans. The previously known six viruses include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which are linked to animals.
Chinese health authorities have added the new type of pneumonia to the Class B list of infectious diseases, in the same category as SARS and HIV. But they said they would enforce the strictest controls, usually used for the most dangerous illnesses, Class A diseases such as cholera and the plague, to try to contain the coronavirus.
That meant authorities could forcibly quarantine people known to have or suspected to have the coronavirus, and would inform the public of every new case nationwide. Immigration authorities have also added the new pneumonia to a list of infectious diseases of interest to them.
The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said that there was not a complete ban on movement in and out of Wuhan.
The government was sharply criticized as having played down or covered up the extent of the SARS virus, but experts say Chinese authorities have learned many lessons in the 17-years since then.
'The new pneumonia in Wuhan reminds many people of the SARS epidemic in 2003,' said a social media account run by the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, vowing not to repeat those mistakes.
'Self-deception will only make the epidemic worse and turn a natural disaster that was controllable into a man-made disaster at great cost,' said the post, which was later deleted. 'Only openness can minimize panic to the greatest extent.'

U.S. Treasury Yields Test Recent Lows; Yields slide on concerns over spread of deadly virus in China

U.S. government bond yields fell toward the bottom of their recent range Tuesday, highlighting a search for safer assets amid worries about a deadly virus outbreak in China .
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 1.768%, its lowest close since Dec. 3, compared with 1.834% on Friday. U.S. markets were closed Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
Yields, which fall when bond prices rise, slid overnight along with global stocks after a leading Chinese health official said a newly identified virus that originated in central China had spread between humans. That sparked memories among investors of the 2002 outbreak of SARS, a similar coronavirus that killed 774 people and slowed the Chinese economy.
Investors view Treasurys as one of the safest assets in the world because they offer a steady stream of income with essentially no risk of default.
Some analysts said Treasurys had been primed to rally because they hadn't sold off in recent weeks, even as investors piled into riskier assets, sending stocks to new records.
"You're definitely getting the bid here in rates," said Justin Lederer, senior trader of interest rates at Cantor Fitzgerald LP. "It's been impressive that even with the more risk-on events…you really haven't been able to push rates significantly higher."

* Argentine Governor Rattles Markets With Plans to Delay Bond Payment 
* Bank of Japan Leaves Policy Unchanged 
Despite progress in U.S.-China trade relations and easing recession fears, analysts say demand for Treasurys has been supported by soft inflation and signals that Federal Reserve officials are in no rush to change short-term interest rates.
Inflation is a main threat to longer-term bonds because it erodes the purchasing power of their fixed payments. Any sign that the Fed is poised to cut interest rates again would likely drag down Treasury yields in the near-term, especially on those with shorter maturities. But it could eventually lead to higher longer-term yields if it helped spur inflation, some analysts say.

Dow Falls 152 Points on China Virus Fears; Boeing shares decline as aerospace company says its 737 MAX jet likely will be grounded through mid-2020

Stocks declined on more bad news from Boeing and fears that a pneumonialike virus that originated in China is spreading.
Federal health officials said a man in Washington state has been diagnosed with the new Wuhan coronavirus, the first case to be confirmed in the U.S. in an outbreak that has sickened hundreds of people in Asia.
Investors fear that if the sickness grows into a pandemic like the SARS outbreak in 2002, it could slow global economic growth.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 152.06 points, or 0.5%, to 29196.04, its first decline in six sessions. The S&P 500 fell 8.83 points, or 0.3%, to 3320.79. The Nasdaq Composite lost 18.14 points, or 0.2%, to 9370.81.
All three indexes have repeatedly hit highs in the weeks since the U.S. and China indicated progress on a trade deal.
Shares of Boeing dropped $10.78, or 3.3%, to $313.37. The company said it expects its 737 MAX jet will be grounded through mid-2020, following fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.
The stock remains the second-most expensive issue in the price-weighted index, which means moves in its share price can have a disproportionately large effect on the Dow's overall change.
The benchmarks followed their overseas counterparts lower. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index lost 0.1%. The Shanghai Composite dropped 1.4%, its biggest fall in more than two months, and the Chinese yuan lost 0.6% against the dollar in offshore trading.
Investors are concerned the coronavirus could quickly be transmitted across Asia as millions of Chinese travel for the annual Lunar New Year holiday. More than 300 people have been sickened and at least six have died. A similar disease led to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in late 2002 in southern China, killing 774 people.
"The economic consequences could be extremely concerning," said Rajiv Biswas, chief economist for the Asia-Pacific region at IHS Markit. "China's international tourism has boomed, so the risks of a global SARS-like virus epidemic spreading globally have become even more severe."
Although a deadly virus is itself concerning, the equities market was primed for a selloff after such a steady ascent, said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at U.K. brokerage AvaTrade.
"The market was looking for an excuse to sell off," he said. "Whenever you're sitting at record highs, retracement's always in the air."
He said he was more interested in the message sent to the Federal Reserve by President Trump from Davos, Switzerland. In his speech at the World Economic Forum, the president pressured the Fed to cut rates more than they already have.
"It's what the smart money is looking at," Mr. Aslam said. "Once that message becomes very public and very clear, it means we will have an enormous tailwind for stocks."
That message didn't seem to make a dent. Shares of companies that could be more directly affected by the virus' spread were mostly lower. MGM Resorts International, Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands dropped more than 5%. American Airlines and United Airlines Holdings fell more than 4%.
"Global asset markets have been pricing in this blue-sky scenario: There wasn't a cloud in the sky," said Cliff Tan, East Asian head of global markets research at Japanese bank MUFG. "Now we have a cloud."
Hong Kong's Hang Seng benchmark was the worst performer among major Asian benchmarks, falling 2.8% in its biggest decline in more than five months.
Adding to the gloom in Hong Kong, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the city's credit rating . The ratings firm blamed the government for failing to deal with seven months of social unrest, which has driven the economy into recession.
Within commodities markets, copper prices fell 1.8%, the biggest fall in four months, on concerns about the impact of the virus on China's economy.

Quickly spreading virus raises fears across China

Hundreds of millions travel for holiday amid outbreak that has killed 3
BEIJING " Under the best of circumstances, the Spring Festival in China is a logistical exercise of mind-blowing proportions: hundreds of millions of people traveling via planes, trains, buses and taxis to return to their hometowns to ring in the new lunar year with their families. 
It's the biggest human migration on the planet. And that's without mentioning the bursting bags of gifts, clothing, food and liquor that travel with them.
But this year, authorities are dealing with a new and potentially deadly challenge: the spread of a mysterious, pneumonia-like virus that has killed four people. Experts initially thought the virus, which began in an animal market, could not be spread between people but have now confirmed is being transmitted between humans.
'The outbreak is at a critical stage, and we estimate an increasing number of infections during the 40 days of Spring Festival travel rush,' said Zhong Nanshan, the leader of a group of experts at China's National Health Commission and the respiratory disease specialist who discovered the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, during an outbreak in China in 2003. 
China's National Health Commission has confirmed 219 cases nationwide, almost all of the cases in the central city of Wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected on Dec. 31. But the diagnosis of the virus in other parts of the country, including among people who have not been to Wuhan, shows that the virus can be spread through human contact, Zhong told the state broadcaster, CCTV, Monday night.
'Guangdong has confirmed two cases that were definitely contagious [between humans], because the patients have never been to Wuhan, but had been transmitted via infected family members,' said Zhong, referring to the southern province on the border with Hong Kong, where there have been 14 confirmed cases.
Furthermore, 15 medical staff who treated the first patients in Wuhan have been diagnosed with the virus. A fourth infected person in Wuhan died Monday.
While Zhong and other experts expressed confidence that the virus could be contained and controlled, they said the mass movement of people around the country for the Spring Festival would complicate those efforts.
'If you live in Wuhan and have a fever, you should not leave the city right now,' Zhong said.
The news that the virus can be passed between people sparked panicked buying of surgical masks across the country on Tuesday morning and led some people to cancel their travel plans.
The timing of the outbreak could hardly be worse. China's Ministry of Transport expects an astonishing 3 billion trips to be taken in the 40 days that surround Lunar New Year's Day, which falls on Saturday.
The Spring Festival, signaling the dawn of a new lunar year " the Year of the Rat, according to the Chinese zodiac " is the most important holiday on the Chinese calendar. Migrant workers of all stripes, from those who labor in factories to upwardly mobile professionals in big cities, return to their hometowns. It's often the only time each year that families can gather together.
This flood of humanity even has a special name in Chinese: 'Chunyun,' from the characters for spring and movement.
China's multitudinous trains are packed literally to the rafters during this odyssey. People lie under the seats in sleeper cars and crouch in the hallways or in the vestibules between train cars. It's not unheard of for people, even adults, to contort themselves into the overhead luggage racks. Those who aren't so lucky might find themselves standing for a 12-hour journey home.
Despite the crush, the atmosphere on the trains is convivial and filled with the aroma of instant noodles. Almost everyone is excited to be going home and eager to share their snacks and their bottles of baijiu liquor (although some try not to drink a drop of anything to avoid having to go to the bathroom and potentially losing their few inches of real estate).
But as China becomes wealthier, and as more young professionals dread the idea of going home to be harangued about still being single, many people opt out of the spring movement by going abroad. Southeast Asia is a popular destination because it's close, warm and cheap.
As a result, authorities in neighboring countries are also on high alert.
Cases of the mystery coronavirus have now been confirmed in Thailand and Japan, and on Monday, a woman was quarantined after thermal detectors at South Korea's main airport, Incheon, singled her out. Health authorities in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Vietnam are also monitoring suspected cases.
Three international airports in the United States " Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York's John F. Kennedy " have started screening passengers on flights from China.
The virus appears to have started in a market that sold wild snakes, marmots, frogs and hedgehogs.
At the end of December, a cluster of pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, a city of 11-million people that straddles the Yangtze River in central China. The cases were traced to the west wing of the Huanan seafood market, where wild and exotic animals were sold for consumption. 
State media described the market as 'filthy and messy,' and it has been closed down and disinfected.
The market is less than a mile from the Hankou train station, one of Wuhan's biggest transportation hubs. About 100,000 passengers pass through the station each day.
In the first 10 days of the Spring Festival travel period, there were more than 4-million trips through Wuhan by air, railway and highway, according to local media, and some 81-million journeys on the city's public transportation network.
It wasn't until Friday, after two deaths, that authorities in Wuhan started to check passengers' body temperatures at airports and railway and bus stations. The local authorities have also launched a 'patriotic health campaign,' disinfecting major bus, train and subway stations.
'I am quite worried,' said Zhou, a business owner in Wuhan who declined to provide her full name. She noted that stores had run out of masks. 'What if it spreads very quickly? I hope it can be brought under control soon.'
Still, the mystery virus is spreading.
There have been five confirmed cases in the capital. The Beijing Health Commission said it has stocked enough antibiotics and asked 89 public hospitals to provide outpatient treatment for fever to cope with a possible 'flu outbreak' during the holidays. 
Five people who experienced respiratory problems after visiting Wuhan have been hospitalized in four cities across Zhejiang, outside Shanghai, and two people in Shanghai have been diagnosed with it.
In the south, 14 people in Guangdong province have been diagnosed with the virus. The severity of the infections was not disclosed.
Guangdong was the epicenter of the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003. More than 8,000 people were infected and 774 died. The virus spread to 37 countries before being contained.
China's ruling Communist Party was widely condemned for trying to cover up the outbreak and stifle news reports about SARS, contributing to its spread. In the current outbreak, health authorities in Wuhan have been posting updates every night, although often after midnight.
Nevertheless, researchers at Imperial College London estimate that the real number of infections is much higher than Chinese authorities have disclosed. They said there were at least 1,723 cases by Jan.-12, before the latest spike, but perhaps as many as 4,500.
Neil M. Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College, said it was not clear whether these were new cases or just new confirmations. Chinese health authorities began conducting a new kind of test Thursday. 'If they are all new cases, that would suggest that there is some human-to-human transmission,' he said.
Chinese authorities are stepping up efforts to contain the virus, telling citizens to wear masks and to try to reduce group activities as much as possible over the Spring Festival.
'Take precautions against transmitting contagious diseases such as the flu, even at get-togethers with family and friends,' the Beijing Health Commission said in a notice. 
Those with symptoms such as fever and coughing are advised to wear face masks and avoid going to work or participating in group activities. 'If you are obligated to attend, please stay at least one meter away from the next individual,' the commission said.
Health authorities in Shanghai and Zhejiang have allocated more staff in triage and fever clinics in hospitals and have set up new emergency procedures for dealing with suspected cases.-

CHINAVirus outbreak widens as screening increases
A pneumonia outbreak in central China widened, with more than 200 people found to have a new SARS-like virus, as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there are signs that some may have caught the illness from other people.
Health officials in Wuhan reported 136 cases over the weekend, including a third fatality. Cases were also reported in Beijing and the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, adding to those found in Thailand and Japan last week.
The surge in cases 'is the result of increased searching and testing' for the novel coronavirus among people sick with respiratory illness, the World Health Organization said Monday. The United States scaled up screening at airports Friday for cases among travelers ahead of the Lunar New Year festival in coming days, when more than 6,000 people arrive in the United States from Wuhan.
The novel coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, has triggered alarm because of similarities with the one that sparked severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 17 years ago. Unlike SARS, which killed almost 800 people, the 2019-nCov isn't known to have spread to health workers.

EGYPTPompeo expresses 'outrage' over death
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 'expressed outrage' to Egypt's president on Sunday at the death of an American citizen who insisted that he had been wrongfully held in an Egyptian prison, according to a State Department spokeswoman.
Mustafa Kassem, 54, died last week following a protracted hunger strike. 
Pompeo raised his concerns to President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi about Kassem's 'pointless and tragic death' on the sidelines of a summit in Berlin on Libya.
The death of the auto parts dealer from Long Island prompted an outcry from human rights groups and accusations of medical negligence in Egypt's prisons. 
The case also touched a nerve in Washington, which has cultivated close security and diplomatic ties with Egypt despite growing unease over its human rights abuses under general-turned-president Sissi.
Kassem was detained by Egypt in 2013 in what his attorneys described as a vast dragnet during the violent dispersal of an Islamist sit-in that killed hundreds. He was later sentenced to 15 years under a contentious anti-protest law that the government often uses to silence dissent. He maintained his innocence throughout his detention and started a hunger strike last year in protest.
Sissi assumed power in the summer of 2013 and has overseen a sweeping crackdown on dissent.

UKRAINEBodies of Iran crash victims return home
The bodies of the 11 Ukrainians who died when an Iranian missile shot down a passenger plane arrived in Ukraine on Sunday for a farewell ceremony.
They were among the 176 people killed in the Jan. 8 catastrophe, when a Ukraine International Airlines flight heading to Kyiv was brought down shortly after takeoff from Tehran. Iran acknowledged three days later that the plane was mistakenly hit by an antiaircraft missile.
Nine of the Ukrainians who died in the crash were crew members on the Boeing 737-800.
Iran admitted to shooting down the plane only after officials in several Western countries said they had evidence that a missile caused the catastrophe. Iran's initial claims that engine failure brought down the plane angered Ukrainians, who also say that Iran should pay compensation and should be more forthcoming about the circumstances.
The crash occurred just hours after Iran fired missiles at a base in Iraq where U.S. troops were stationed, in retaliation for a U.S. drone strike that killed Iran's most powerful general. 
" Associated Press
At least 75 escape from prison in Paraguay: At least 75 inmates, many of them members of a notorious Brazilian gang, escaped from a Paraguayan prison in a border city, according to authorities, who said they immediately fired the prison's director. Officials said they discovered a tunnel and found cells filled with as many as 200 bags of earth. Interior Minister Euclides Acevedo said that the tunnel may have been a ruse to cover complicity by prison officials and that many of the inmates may have been allowed to walk out through the main gate. Acevedo said most of the escapees belong to the First Capital Command in Brazil, which borders the city where the prison is located.

Jury of 7 men, 5 women selected for Weinstein trial 
NEW YORK -- A jury of seven men and five women was selected Friday for Harvey Weinstein's rape trial after an arduous, two-week process in which scores of people were dismissed because they had already made up their minds about the disgraced Hollywood mogul.
Opening statements are expected Wednesday in the case against the 67-year-old executive who has come to be seen as the arch-villain of the #MeToo era.
The once powerful and feared studio boss behind such Oscar winners as "Pulp Fiction" and "Shakespeare in Love" is charged with raping a woman in a New York City hotel room in 2013 and forcibly performing a sex act on another at his apartment in 2006. He has said any sexual activity was consensual. If convicted, he could get life in prison.
During jury selection, prosecutors accused Weinstein's lawyers of systematically trying to keep young women off the panel, though the final gender makeup of the jury turned out to be more closely balanced.
"We got the best jury we could get under the circumstances," defense attorney Donna Rotunno told reporters.
A stooped Weinstein, shuffling out of the courthouse with the use of a walker, had no comment on jury selection. "Ask Donna!" he said, referring to Rotunno.
Weinstein's lawyers have tried, so far unsuccessfully, to move the trial out New York City, arguing that heavy publicity has turned the case into a "carnival" and that the media hub where celebrities and ordinary people often intersect can't possibly give their client a fair trial. 
Justices to consider faithless electors, ahead of 2020 vote
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court said Friday it will decide ahead of the 2020 election whether presidential electors are bound to support the popular vote winner in their states or can opt for someone else.
Advocates for the court's intervention say the issue needs urgent resolution in an era of intense political polarization and the prospect of a razor-thin margin in a presidential election, although so-called faithless electors have been a footnote so far in U.S. history.
The case arises from the 2016 presidential election. Three Hillary Clinton electors in Washington state and one in Colorado refused to vote for her despite her popular vote win in both states. Thus they hoped to persuade enough electors in states won by Donald Trump to choose someone else and deny Trump the presidency. 
3 US airports screen for new virus amid outbreak in China
LOS ANGELES -- Federal authorities will begin screening airline travelers arriving from Wuhan, China, for signs that they may be infected with a new coronavirus that is spreading in Asia, officials announced Friday.
Passengers flying into Los Angeles International Airport, San Francisco International Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York will be examined for the virus's pneumonialike symptoms, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
About 100 additional CDC workers will be deployed to join existing public health staff at the three airports.
The newly evolved virus, known as 2019-nCoV, has sickened at least 41 people and killed two. Thailand and Japan have each identified infected patients as well. 
Ex-Guantanamo commander convicted of lying in probe
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- A former commander of the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay was convicted Friday of interfering with an investigation into the death of a civilian with whom the commander had fought and argued over his affair with the man's wife.
A federal jury in Jacksonville convicted Navy Capt. John R. Nettleton on charges of obstruction of justice, concealing material facts, falsifying records and making false statements.
Nettleton wasn't charged with Christopher Tur's death. He could get 75 years, but guidelines suggest his term will be significantly less.
Nettleton denied to his superior officer and others that he had the affair, but investigators later determined that it had happened, according to prosecutors in Jacksonville. 
Ukrainian president rejects PM's resignation
KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy rejected his prime minister's offer to resign and asked him to stay on the job Friday after he was caught on tape saying Zelenskiy -- a former sitcom star with no previous political experience -- knows nothing about the economy.
In a video released by Zelenskiy's office, the president called the situation "unpleasant" but asked Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk and his Cabinet to carry on.
The offer to step down was subject to approval by the Rada, Ukraine's parliament, which is dominated by Zelenskiy's party. It presented a legal quandary since Ukrainian law prevents the Cabinet's dismissal for a year after it presents its program. Honcharuk did so in September.
Zelenskiy demanded an investigation into the source of the recording. 
Former Rep. Chris Collins sentenced to over 2 years
NEW YORK -- A former congressman who was one of President Donald Trump's first supporters was sentenced Friday to two years and two months in federal prison after admitting he helped his son and others dodge $800,000 in stock market losses when he learned that a drug trial by a small pharmaceutical company had failed.
Christopher Collins, 69, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick in Manhattan after the Republican pleaded guilty in October to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and lying to law enforcement.
The trading, prosecutors said, enabled Cameron Collins and friends to dodge $800,000 in losses.
Broderick called it baffling that Collins would exercise such poor judgment when he and his son had the financial means to deal with any loss. 
In Paris: Dozens of protesters blocked the entrance to the Louvre museum and forced the famous Paris landmark to close Friday while they denounced the French government's pension overhaul plans.
The protesters, who included some Louvre employees, staged the demonstration against President Emmanuel Macron's proposals after several hard-left trade unions appealed for public actions to oppose that they said would "lower everyone's pensions."
The museum's Leonardo da Vinci exhibit marking the 500th anniversary of the Italian master's death was included in the closure. Protesters chanted, "Mona Lisa in on strike, Leonardo is on strike."

BEIJING " An outbreak of an unidentified and possibly new viral disease in central China is prompting officials across Asia to take heightened precautions ahead of the busy Lunar New Year travel season.
Officials in Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines said in recent days that they will begin setting up quarantine zones or scanning passengers from China for signs of fever or other pneumonialike symptoms that may indicate a new disease possibly linked to a wild animal market in Wuhan.
The health commission in Wuhan, a transit and business hub, says there is no clear evidence that the unidentified disease can be transmitted between humans, and no health-care workers have been infected. Cases of fever have been reported in Hong Kong and Taiwan by travelers who recently visited Wuhan, although there is no confirmation that the illnesses are linked.
Since mid-December, 59 people have been diagnosed with viral pneumonia of 'unknown cause' " including seven who are critically ill, according to Wuhan's health commission. The officials said an additional 163 people who have come into close contact with the infected have been placed under close observation. No deaths have been reported.
Several of the patients worked at Wuhan's South China Seafood City, said the authorities, who shut down the market Jan. 1 to carry out daily disinfections. The 1,000-stall bazaar sold not only seafood but marmots, spotted deer and venomous snakes, according to state media reports that described the market as 'filthy and messy.'
Videos from Wuhan showed the market barricaded in recent days and guarded by police wearing surgical masks.
The emergence of a new illness out of China has carried echoes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which infected more than 8,000 people, killed 774 and sparked mass panic as it spread across more than two dozen countries over eight months after starting in China in November 2002.
SARS is thought to be an animal virus from an as-yet-uncertain animal reservoir, perhaps bats, that spread to other animals, such as civet cats, and first infected humans in China's Guangdong province, according to the World Health Organization. The tropical civet is sold and eaten as a delicacy in south China. The SARS epidemic delivered a political shock to the Communist Party, which was widely condemned for mismanaging the outbreak, covering up cases and smothering news reports.
Wuhan's health commission, which has given relatively regular news updates, said the new pneumonia cases were not caused by SARS. It has also ruled out influenza, bird flu, adenoviruses and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and said nucleic acid analysis was underway to identify the pathogen.
'There are now two key questions: What is the cause of the disease? Is it a brand new virus?' said Leo Poon, a Hong Kong University epidemiologist who was among the first to decode the SARS coronavirus. 'Next: Is it transmissible between humans? We cannot yet rule out the possibility entirely.'
Because Wuhan authorities began quarantining and disinfecting the market on New Year's Day, the number of new cases should taper off in the coming weeks, Poon said.
'But if there are additional cases, that may suggest human-to-human transmission' that would greatly complicate the situation, he added.
The WHO said it is monitoring the situation in China. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a low-level travel notice Monday, reminding travelers to practice 'usual precautions' inside the country.
On Tuesday, the CDC said it has established an incident management structure to 'optimize domestic and international coordination in the event additional public health actions are required,' according to a notice the agency sent to state health officers and public health emergency preparedness directors.
There are no known U.S. cases or any cases in any countries outside China, the CDC said. 'But outbreaks of unknown respiratory disease are always of concern, particularly when there are possible zoonotic origins to the outbreak,' the CDC statement said.
On Wednesday, the CDC issued a health advisory to clinicians to consider pneumonia as a diagnosis for patients with severe respiratory symptoms who have been to Wuhan since Dec. 1, had illness within two weeks of returning and do not have another diagnosis that would explain their illness. 
Public health experts say it is reassuring that no health-care workers have fallen sick. When the SARS outbreak began, the major alarm bells were illness in doctors and nurses and the spread of disease from person to person, said Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 
But while Chinese officials have ruled out several causes of the illnesses, they have not provided detailed information about what tests were performed, when they were done and at what point in the patients' illnesses. Nor have Chinese officials provided a timeline of patient illnesses, information that is typically made public quickly in disease outbreaks. 
'We've heard they ruled out SARS and MERS and other coronaviruses. There seem to be a lot of reports that this is a novel pathogen, but we haven't seen the evidence,' said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the same center.
In the absence of additional information from Wuhan officials, other countries have announced additional measures, such as quarantine and fever screening at airports. If there is predictable and daily communication from Chinese health leaders in charge of the response about what is known and what is unknown about the outbreak, that 'would tamp down some of the anxiety' about the disease and the response, Nuzzo said.
If the Wuhan pneumonia were found to be contagious, it could pose a major public health challenge coming just before the Lunar New Year holiday, when more than 400 million Chinese are expected to travel " including 7 million who vacation overseas.
In Beijing, the capital's health officials this week called for 'public health readiness' to respond to emergencies during the holiday period of Jan. 24-30.
In Hong Kong, 30 people who have visited Wuhan in recent weeks have been hospitalized with fever, and pharmacies in the city quickly sold out of face masks, local media reported. 
The city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, said Tuesday that authorities have rolled out new measures that would require Hong Kong's doctors to report suspected cases and give city officials legal powers to quarantine suspected patients.
All travelers by high-speed rail from Wuhan will have their body temperature tested before entering Hong Kong, Lam said. 
The Taiwanese government said eight people traveling from Wuhan have exhibited fever, and it was offering to send epidemiologists to Wuhan to help investigate.
Xu Jianguo, a former top Chinese public health official, struck an assuring note and said the government's disease control capabilities today are much stronger than they were in the early 2000s.
'More than a decade has passed,' he said. 'It's impossible for something like SARS to happen again.'

HONG KONG—Chinese scientists investigating a mystery illness that has sickened dozens in central China have discovered a new strain of coronavirus, a development that will test the country's upgraded capabilities for dealing with unfamiliar infectious diseases .
The novel coronavirus was genetically sequenced from a sample from one patient and subsequently found in some of the others affected in the city of Wuhan, people familiar with the findings said. Chinese authorities haven't concluded that the strain is the underlying cause of sickness in all the patients who have been isolated in Wuhan since the infection first broke out in early December, the people said.
Chinese state media reported Thursday that the unidentified pneumonia "is believed to be a new type of coronavirus," citing experts. State media reported that the results were preliminary and more research was needed to understand the virus.
There are many known coronaviruses—some can cause ailments like common colds in humans, while others don't affect humans at all. Some—such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS-coronavirus, identified in 2003—have led to deadly outbreaks, lending urgency to efforts to contain the current situation.
The number of reported cases of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, was 59 on Sunday, rising from 27 on Dec. 31, according to Wuhan's Municipal Health Commission, with seven people in critical condition. No deaths have been reported.
The disease afflicting patients in Wuhan hasn't been transmitted from human to human, and health-care workers have remained uninfected, according to city health officials as of Sunday, suggesting that what is sickening them is for now less virulent than SARS. Those ill in Wuhan are believed to have become sick through exposure to animals linked to a live seafood and animal market.
Health experts say one risk is that the disease could become a bigger threat as tens of millions of Chinese travel around the country during the Lunar New Year holidays that begin in just over two weeks.
Health authorities in Singapore and Hong Kong, cities that have direct flights from Wuhan, have issued alerts and quarantined patients traveling from the region who show signs of fever or breathing difficulties.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked health-care providers and state and local health departments on Wednesday to screen patients with severe respiratory illnesses about whether they have traveled to Wuhan. Any patients meeting those criteria should be reported immediately to public health authorities, the U.S. public health agency said in a health advisory. No cases have been reported in the U.S., the CDC said, adding that it is prepared to respond "if additional public health actions are required."
In Hong Kong on Tuesday, the government said it was taking precautions against a "severe respiratory disease associated with a novel infectious agent." that it is seeking to make a statutory notifiable infectious disease, meaning doctors would need to report any suspected cases, and patients evading quarantine could be fined or jailed.
China was criticized for initially covering up SARS, which was first detected in late 2002 but was disclosed only after it began spreading widely, eventually killing 774 people globally, according to the World Health Organization. Beijing overhauled the nation's disease control after reviews found that initial failures to contain and isolate patients with SARS allowed it to proliferate across densely populated southern China.
The Wuhan outbreak will test how much has changed.
"We learned a bitter lesson in 2003, and we do not want that to happen again," said Alex Lam, chairman of advocacy group Hong Kong Patients' Voices. "China should immediately release their findings so doctors across the world can better know how to tackle this illness."
Hong Kong's department of health, citing information from China's National Health Commission, said the cause of the cluster of pneumonia cases detected in Wuhan was still under investigation, but other known respiratory pathogens had been ruled out.
The main clinical symptoms of those affected by the Wuhan outbreak are fever—with a few patients having difficulty breathing—and invasive lesions of both lungs, which show up on chest radiographs, the WHO said Sunday.
It is unclear what the underlying source of the disease is, though the reported link to a wholesale fish and live-animal market could indicate an exposure link to animals, the WHO said. Bats, for example, are known reservoirs for coronaviruses, and have been found to transmit the disease to humans through a third vector such as a civet cat, as scientists found in the case of SARS.
The pattern of the unexplained pneumonia cases linked to the market selling seafood and live game strongly suggests that this is a novel microbe jumping from animal to human, said K.Y. Yuen, chair professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong's Faculty of Medicine.
Researchers have determined that a large proportion of new infectious diseases in humans are transmitted via animals. Such illnesses are referred to as zoonoses. Two newer human coronaviruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, have been known to cause severe illness and death, according to the U.S. CDC.
The Wuhan strain is similar to bat coronaviruses that were a precursor to SARS, a person familiar with the new findings said.
Given the marked advances in hospital isolation facilities, infection-control training and laboratory diagnostic capabilities in the past two decades, it is unlikely that this outbreak will lead to a major 2003-like epidemic, Mr. Yuen said.
In Wuhan, which has China's first Biosafety Level 4 laboratory—a specialized research laboratory that deals with potentially deadly infectious agents like Ebola—the market at the center of investigations has been shut since Jan 1.
In Hong Kong, badly hit by the SARS virus, which claimed 299 lives locally in 2003, residents have donned surgical masks on the streets and public transport in recent days, despite no local cases of the Wuhan infection being confirmed.
